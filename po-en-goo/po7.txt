I lay on my back, with her head on my shoulder, without a single thought. The darkness filling the room was populating. I heard footsteps. The walls disappeared. Something was towering over me, higher and higher, limitless. Penetrated through, embraced without touch, I froze in the darkness, I felt its transparency, sharp, displacing the air. Very far away, I heard a heart. I focused all my attention, the rest of my strength on waiting for the agony. It didn&#39;t come. I just kept getting smaller, and the invisible sky, invisible horizons, space, shapeless, cloudless, starless, receding and huge, made me its center, I tried to crawl into what I was lying on, but there was nothing below me and the darkness no longer covered anything. Appliances, shelves, corners of the walls traced out as if in broad, matte strokes, only contoured, no color of their own. The brightest pearly white in the silence outside the window. My body was wet with sweat, I looked to the side, she was looking at me. &quot;Does your arm hurt?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; She lifted her head. Her eyes were the same color as the room, gray, luminous between black lashes. I felt the warmth of her whisper before I understood the words. &quot;No. Oh, yes. I put my hand on her shoulder. The touch tingled. I took it with my other hand. - You had a bad dream. - Sleep? Yes, sleep. And you haven&#39;t been sleeping? - I do not know. May not. I&#39;m not sleepy. But you sleep. Why are you looking like that? I closed my eyes. I could feel the small, steady beating of her heart where mine was beating slower. A prop, I thought. But nothing surprised me, not even my own indifference. I was past my fear and despair. I was farther, oh, so far no one was yet. I touched her neck with my lips and went down, into a small, shell-smooth hollow between the tendons. And here was the heartbeat. I got up on my elbow. No aurora, no softness of dawn, the horizon was covered with an electric blue glow, the first beam shot through the room like a shot, everything played with reflections, the rainbow reflections in the mirror, in the doorknobs, in the nickel pipes, it seemed that the light hit every surface it met, as if wanted to break free, to blow up the cramped room. It was no longer possible to watch. I turned around. Harey&#39;s pupils dimmed. Gray eyes lifted up to my face. - Is it time for the day yet? she asked in a dull voice. It was like half a dream, half awake. - It&#39;s always like this, honey. - And us? - What we? - Will we be here long? I wanted to laugh. But when the faint noise escaped my chest, it was nothing like laughter. - I think quite a long time. You do not want? Her eyelids did not twitch. She looked at me carefully. Did she blink? I wasn&#39;t sure. She pulled up the blanket and a small, triangular birthmark turned pink on her arm. - Why are you looking like that? - Because you&#39;re beautiful. She smiled. But it was just a courtesy, thanks for the compliment. - Really? &#39;Cause you look like you&#39;re... like I&#39;m... - What? - As if you were looking for something. - You&#39;re talking! &quot;Not as if you think there&#39;s something wrong with me or that I haven&#39;t told you something.&quot; - Of course not. &quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;re denying, sure.&quot; But as you like. Behind the blazing windows, a dead blue heat was born. Shading my eyes with my hand, I fumbled for my glasses. They were on the table. I knelt on the bed, put them on, and saw her reflection in the mirror. She was expecting something. When I lay down next to her again, she smiled. - And for me? Suddenly I understood. - Glasses? I got up and rummaged through the drawers on the table by the window. I found two pairs, both too big. I handed it to her. She tried both. It fell halfway down her nose. With a long creaking, the window covers began to slide shut. A moment and inside the Station, which like a turtle hid in its shell, night reigned. I groped her and took off her glasses and placed them under the bed with mine. - What will we do? she asked. - What you do at night: sleep. - Kris. - What? - Maybe I&#39;ll make you a new wrap. - No, you don&#39;t have to. No need... honey. When I said this, I myself did not understand if I was pretending, but suddenly in the darkness I embraced her slender back blindly and, feeling it trembling, believed in her. Anyway, I don&#39;t know. It suddenly seemed to me that I was deceiving her, and not she me, because she was only herself. I fell asleep a few more times after that, and still the spasm woke me from my doze, my pounding heart slowly calmed down, I pressed her to me, dead tired, she touched my face, my forehead, very carefully, checking if I had a fever. It was Harry. There could be no other truer. After that thought, something changed in me. I stopped fighting. I fell asleep almost immediately. A gentle touch woke me up. There was a nice coolness on his forehead. I lay with my face covered in something moist and soft that rose slowly, I looked into Harey&#39;s face bent over me. With both hands, she squeezed excess liquid from the gauze into a china bowl. Beside it was a bottle of anti-scald liquid. She smiled at me. &quot;What a dream you have,&quot; she said, and putting the gauze back on, &quot;Does it hurt?&quot; - No. I moved the skin of my forehead. Indeed, the burns did not bother me now. Harey was sitting on the edge of the bed, wrapped in a men&#39;s bathrobe, white with orange stripes, black hair spilled over the collar. Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows so they wouldn&#39;t get in the way. I felt incredibly hungry, I must have had nothing to eat in twenty hours. When Harey finished my facial, I stood up. My gaze suddenly fell on two identical white dresses with red buttons lying side by side, the first I had helped her take off by cutting the neckline, and the second she had come in yesterday. This time she unraveled the seam herself with scissors. She said the lock was jammed. Those two identical dresses were the scariest thing I&#39;ve ever experienced. Harey was bustling around the medicine cabinet, tidying it up. I surreptitiously turned away from her and bit my fist bloody. Still looking at the two dresses - or rather one and the same dress repeated twice - I started backing towards the door. The water was still dripping from the tap, making a noise. I opened the door, slipped quietly into the corridor, and closed it carefully. I heard the faint murmur of running water and the clinking of bottles, then suddenly the sound ceased. In the corridor, oblong ceiling lamps burned, a dim patch of reflected light lay on the surface of the door where I waited with clenched jaws. I held the doorknob, though I didn&#39;t expect to be able to hold it. A violent yank nearly ripped it out of my hand, but the door didn&#39;t open, just shuddered and creaked horribly. Stunned, I let go of the handle and stepped back, something incredible was happening to the door, its smooth plastic plate bending as if forced from my side into the room. The enamel began to chip away in tiny shards, exposing the steel of the door frame, which grew more and more taut. Suddenly I understood: instead of pushing the door that opened into the corridor, she was trying to open it by pulling it towards her. The reflection of light curved on the white sheet as in a concave mirror, there was a powerful crunch and a uniform, curved sheet cracked. At the same time, the doorknob, torn from the mount, flew into the room. Immediately bloody hands appeared in the opening and, leaving red marks on the paintwork, they continued - the door panel broke in two, hanging diagonally from its hinges, and an orange-and-white creature with a blue, dead face threw itself on my chest, weeping. If the sight hadn&#39;t paralyzed me, I probably would have tried to escape. Harey gasped convulsively, banging her head against my shoulder, her hair flying wildly. As I hugged her, I felt her slipping through my hands. I carried her into the room, squeezing past the shattered door leaf, and laid her on the bed. Her fingernails were wet with blood and broken. When she turned her hand away, I saw the inside of her hand raw flesh. I looked at her face, open eyes looking through me, expressionless. - Harry! She replied with an inarticulate grunt. I brought my finger to her eye. The eyelid closed. I walked over to the medicine cabinet. The bed creaked. I turned around. She sat up straight, looking fearfully at her bloody hands. &quot;Kris,&quot; she moaned, &quot;I... I... what happened to me?&quot; &quot;You cut yourself breaking the door,&quot; I said dryly. I had something in my lips, especially the lower one, as if ants were walking on it. I clenched it with my teeth. Harey stared at the jagged pieces of plastic hanging loosely from the frame for a moment, then turned her eyes back to me. Her chin twitched, and I saw the effort she was making to control her fear. I cut up the sheets of gauze, took some wound powder from the cupboard, and went back to bed. Everything I was carrying suddenly slipped from my lowered hands, the glass jar with its gelatin membrane burst, but I didn&#39;t even bend over. He was no longer needed. I raised her hand. Dried blood still fringed the fingernails thinly, but the bruises were gone, and the palms of the hands were sealed with young, pink skin that was brighter than the surrounding area. The scar had almost faded before the eyes. I sat down, stroked her face, and tried to smile at her, can&#39;t say I succeeded. - Why did you do it, Harry? - No. It&#39;s me? Her eyes pointed to the door. - Yes. You do not remember? - No. I mean, I saw you were gone, I got really scared and... - So what? - I started looking for you, I thought maybe you were in the bathroom... Only now I noticed that the wardrobe, pushed aside, shows the entrance to the bathroom. - And then? - I ran to the door. - And what? - I don&#39;t remember. Something must have happened? - What? - I do not know. - What do you remember? What happened next? - I was sitting here on the bed. - And how I brought you, don&#39;t you remember? She hesitated. The corners of her mouth turned down, her face tense. - Seems to. Maybe. I do not know. She swung her legs to the floor and stood up. She walked over to the shattered door. - Kris! I took her by the shoulders from behind. She was trembling. Suddenly she turned around, looking for my eyes. &quot;Kris,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Kris. - Calm down. - Kris, if, Kris, do I have epilepsy? Epilepsy, good God! I wanted to laugh. - Where is it, honey. Just a door, you know, there&#39;s this, well, this door... We left the room as the outer armor with a long creak opened the windows, revealing the sun&#39;s disk sinking into the ocean. I headed for the small kitchen area at the far end of the hall. Harey and I farmed together, rummaging cupboards and refrigerators. I soon noticed that she wasn&#39;t very good at cooking, and could do little more than open cans of tinned food, which is as much as I do. I devoured the contents of two such cans and drank countless cups of coffee. Harey also ate, but as children sometimes do, not wanting to upset the adults, not even with compulsion, but mechanically and indifferently. We then went to a small operating room next to the radio station; I had a plan. I said I wanted to examine her just in case, sat her down on the reclining chair and took the syringe and needles out of the sterilizer. I knew where everything was almost by heart, that&#39;s how we&#39;d been drilled in the training copy of the Station on Earth. I took a drop of blood from her finger, made a smear, dried it in an exhaust hood, and dusted it with silver ions in a high vacuum. The matter-of-factness of the job was reassuring. Harey, reclining on the cushions of a reclining chair, looked around the camera-crowded operating room. The silence was broken by the intermittent beeper of the internal telephone. I picked up the handset. &quot;Kelvin,&quot; I said. I kept my eyes on Harey, who had been apathetic for some time, as if exhausted by the experiences of the last hours. - Are you in surgery? At last! I heard a sigh of relief. Snaut was speaking. I waited with the receiver pressed to my ear. &quot;You&#39;ve got a visitor, huh?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;And you&#39;re busy?&quot; &quot;Yes . with us.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s new,&quot; I replied, surprised. &quot;What about...&quot; I trailed off and finished, &quot;Is he alone?&quot; &quot;No. I worded it wrong. He wants to talk to us. screens will be blanked out.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah? Then why didn&#39;t he call me directly? Is he ashamed?&quot; &quot;Something like that,&quot; Snaut muttered vaguely, &quot;So how?&quot; Okay. I saw him on the screen, just a face no bigger than the palm of my hand. For a moment marked by the slight hum of the current, he looked me in the eye searchingly. Then he said, with some hesitation, &quot;How are you doing?&quot; &quot;Tolerable. How are you?&quot; &quot;A little worse than you, I suppose. Could I...&quot; &quot;Do you want to come see me?&quot; I guessed. I looked over my shoulder at Harey. and with his leg crossed, tossing with a gesture of unconscious boredom the silvery ball that ended the chain on the arm of the chair. - Leave it, do you hear? Stay, you! Snaut&#39;s raised voice reached me. I saw his profile on the screen. I couldn&#39;t hear the rest, he covered the microphone with his hand, but I saw his mouth moving. - No, I can&#39;t come. Maybe later. So in an hour,&#39; he said quickly, and the screen went blank. I hung up the receiver. - Who it was? Harey asked indifferently. - Such one. snout. Cybernetic. You do not know him. - How long will it take? - What, are you bored? I asked. I loaded the first of a series of slides into the neutrino microscope cassette and pressed the colored knobs of the switches in turn. The force fields buzzed dully. &quot;There are not many amusements here, and if my modest company is not enough for you, it will be difficult,&quot; I said, absentmindedly extending the pauses between words, at the same time I pulled off with both hands the great black head in which the microscope eyepiece shone, and pushed my eyes deep into the soft rubber shell . Harey said something I didn&#39;t get. I saw from above, in a sharp foreshortening, a huge desert, flooded with a silver glow. On it lay, surrounded by a dim haze, as if broken and weathered, flat round rocks. They were red cells. I sharpened the image and, without taking my eyes off my glasses, I seemed to float deeper and deeper into the blazing silvery field of vision. At the same time, with my left hand, I turned the adjusting crank of the stage, and when the blood cell, lying alone like an erratic boulder, was at the intersection of black threads, I increased the magnification. The lens seemed to move over a distorted erythrocyte, sunken in the middle, which already seemed to be the ring of a rock crater, with black, sharp shadows in the hollows of the annular rim. This rim, bristling with crystallized deposits of silver ions, escaped me beyond the limits of the microscopic field. There were dim, as if seen through iridescent water, outlines of half-melted, twisted chains of protein. With one knot of protein ruins at the black junction, I slowly pushed the zoom lever farther and farther, at any moment the end of this journey into the depths would be revealed, the flattened shadow of one molecule filled the whole picture, blurred now! But nothing happened. I should have seen atoms vibrating like a gelatinous quake, but there weren&#39;t any. The screen burned immaculate silver. I pushed the lever all the way. The hum intensified angrily, but I still couldn&#39;t see anything. A repeated, buzzing signal let me know that the apparatus was overloaded. I looked once more into the silver void and turned off the power. I looked at Harry. She opened her mouth in a yawn, which she deftly turned into a smile. - How&#39;s me? she asked. &quot;Very well,&quot; I said. - I think... it couldn&#39;t be better. I kept looking at her, feeling that ant in my lower lip again. What actually happened? What did it mean? This body, seemingly so limp and fragile - in fact indestructible - in its final days turned out to be composed of nothingness? I hit the cylindrical body of the microscope with my fist. Maybe some defect? Maybe the fields don&#39;t focus...? No, I knew the apparatus was operational. I went down all the levels, the cell, the protein conglomerate, the molecules, they all looked exactly like they did on the thousands of slides I&#39;d seen. But the last step down led nowhere. I took her blood from a vein and poured it into a measuring cylinder. I divided it into portions and set about analyzing it. It took me longer than I thought, I lost some practice. Reactions were normal. All. Unless... I dropped a drop of concentrated acid on the red bead. It was smoky, the drop turned grey, covered with a layer of dirty foam. Schedule. Denaturation. Go on! I reached for a test tube. When I turned to the other, the thin glass nearly fell from my fingers. Under the layer of dirty scum at the very bottom of the tube, a layer of dark red was growing again. The blood, burnt with acid, was recreating itself! It was nonsense! It was impossible! - Kris! I heard it from a great distance. - Phone, Chris! - What? Oh yes, thank you. The phone has been ringing for a long time, I just heard it now. &quot;Kelvin.&quot; I picked up the phone. - Snaut. I switched the line so we can hear each other at the same time. &quot;Hello, Dr. Kelvin,&quot; Sartorius&#39;s high, nasal voice said. It sounded as if its owner was stepping onto a dangerously bending podium, suspicious, alert, and outwardly composed. &quot;My respects, Doctor,&quot; I replied. I wanted to laugh, but I wasn&#39;t sure if the reasons for this hilarity were clear enough for me to indulge in it. Who was I supposed to laugh at? I was holding something in my hand: a blood tube. I shook her. She&#39;s already clotted. Maybe it was just an illusion a moment ago? Maybe I just imagined it? - I wanted to present to my colleagues some issues related to ... e ... phantoms - I heard and did not hear Sartorius at the same time. As if it was hitting my consciousness. I defended myself against that voice, still staring at the test tube with the clotted blood. &quot;Let&#39;s call them F-creatures,&quot; Snaut submitted quickly. - Perfect. There was a dark vertical line in the middle of the screen to indicate that I was receiving two channels at the same time - on either side of it should have been the faces of my interlocutors. The glass was dark, however, and only a narrow band of light along the bezel indicated that the apparatus was working, but the screens were blocked by something. &quot;Each of us conducted various tests...&quot; The same caution in the speaker&#39;s nasal voice again. A moment of silence. &quot;Maybe we&#39;ll combine our messages first, and then I could say what I&#39;ve come up with personally... Maybe you first, Dr. Kelvin...&quot; &quot;Me?&quot; - I said. Suddenly I felt Harry&#39;s eyes. I placed the test tube on the table so that it rolled under the racks of glass, and sat on the high tripod, dragging it with my foot. At first I wanted to excuse myself, but all of a sudden I said, &quot;All right. A small seminar? Okay! I&#39;ve done next to nothing, but I can speak. One histology slide and a couple of reactions, Micro-reactions. I got the impression that... Until then, I had no idea what to say. It was as if something had opened up in me. - Everything is normal, but it&#39;s camouflage. Mask. It is, in a sense, a supercopy: a reproduction that is more accurate than the original. This means that where in humans we encounter the end of granularity, the end of structural divisibility, there is a further way here thanks to the use of the sub-atomic building blocks! - In a second. In a second. How do you understand it? asked Sartorius. Snaut didn&#39;t answer. Or was it his rapid breathing echoing through the earpiece? Harley looked over at me. I realized in my own excitement, I almost shouted the last words. Coming to my senses, I slouched on my uncomfortable stool and closed my eyes. How to express it? - The ultimate building block of our bodies are atoms. I suppose that the formations of F are made of units smaller than ordinary atoms. Far smaller. - From mesons...? Sartorius suggested. He wasn&#39;t surprised at all. - No, not mesons... Mesons would be visible. The resolution of this apparatus down here is ten to minus 20 Angstroem. Truth? But you can&#39;t see anything until the end. So not mesons. Probably a neutrino. - How do you imagine it? Because neutrino conglomerates are not permanent... - I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not a physicist. Perhaps they are stabilized by some force field. I don&#39;t know about it. In any case, if it is as I say, the building blocks are particles about ten thousand times smaller than atoms. But that&#39;s not all! If protein molecules and cells were built directly from these &quot;microatoms&quot;, they would have to be correspondingly smaller. Blood cells, ferments, everything, but they are not. It follows that all proteins, cells, cell nuclei are just a mask! The actual structure responsible for the functioning of the &quot;guest&quot; is hidden deeper. - Why, Kelvin! Snaut almost shouted. I stopped, terrified. Did I say &quot;visitor&quot;?! Yes, but Harey didn&#39;t hear it. She wouldn&#39;t have understood anyway. She stared out the window, her head resting on her hand, her small, clean profile outlined against the purple aurora. The receiver was silent. All I could hear was distant breathing. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s possible,&quot; Sartorius added, &quot;only we have the snag that the ocean isn&#39;t made of these hypothetical Kelvin particles. It&#39;s made of ordinary particles.&quot; &quot;Maybe it can synthesize and such,&quot; I remarked. the conversation wasn&#39;t even funny. It wasn&#39;t necessary. &quot;But that would explain the extraordinary stamina,&quot; Snaut muttered, &quot;And the rate of regeneration. Maybe even the energy source is down there, they don&#39;t need to eat...&quot; &quot;Speak up, please,&quot; he said. Sartorius. I hated him. If only he hadn&#39;t fallen out of his self-imposed role! &quot;I want to raise the issue of motivation. The motivation behind the emergence of F creations. I would break it down like this: what are F creations? They are not persons or copies of specific persons, you Only materialized projections of what our brain contains about the person. The accuracy of the term struck me. This Sartorius, however unpleasant, was not stupid. &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; I interjected. - It even explains why the personas of this ... and not others appeared. The most durable traces of memory, the most isolated from all others, have been selected, although, naturally, no such trace can be completely isolated, and in the process of &quot;copying&quot; it, the remnants of other traces, which happen to be nearby, may have been taken, as a result of which the visitor sometimes shows more knowledge than the genuine person he was supposed to imitate could have possessed... &quot;Kelvin!&quot; that his &quot;guest&quot; is inherently less bright than Snaut&#39;s &quot;guest&quot;? motivation for the emergence of the creations F... The first, somewhat natural, is the thought of an experiment conducted on us, but it would be a rather... poor experiment. If we fail, we learn from the results, above all from mistakes, so that we make corrections in its repetitions ... Meanwhile, there is no mention of it. The same F creations reappear... uncorrected... not armed against our... attempts to get rid of them... &quot;In other words, there&#39;s no corrective feedback loop as Dr. Snaut - I noticed. - And the results of this is? &#39;Except that for an experiment, it would be... a botch, otherwise improbable.&#39; The ocean is... precise. This is manifested, for example, in the two-layer construction of F formations. Up to a certain limit, they behave as if ... real ... real ... He could not get out. &quot;Originals,&quot; Snaut prompted. - Yes, the originals. But when the situation exceeds the normal capabilities of the average ... er ... original, there is a sort of &quot;awareness shutdown&quot; of the creature F, and another action, inhuman, is manifested directly ... &quot;I&#39;m not so sure,&quot; protested Sartorius. Suddenly I understood what he was irritating me about: he didn&#39;t speak, but he spoke, just like at an Institute meeting. &quot;This is where individuality comes into play. The ocean is completely devoid of its notion. It must be so. It seems to me, my colleagues, that this for us ... uh ... most sensitive, shocking side of the experiment completely eludes him as lying beyond his comprehension.&quot; &quot;You don&#39;t think it&#39;s intentional...?&quot; I asked. The claim stunned me a bit, but on reflection I admitted that it couldn&#39;t be ruled out. &quot;Yes. I don&#39;t believe in any perfidy, malice, desire to the most severe hit... as colleague Snaut does. &quot;I don&#39;t attribute human feelings to him at all,&quot; Snaut spoke for the first time, &quot;but can you tell me how you try to explain these constant returns?&quot; &quot;Maybe they set up some device that runs over and over again, like a gramophone record,&quot; I said, not without a hidden desire to tease Sartorius. &quot;Comrades, please, let&#39;s not get distracted,&quot; the doctor said nasally. - That&#39;s not all I wanted to say. Normally, I would consider it premature to submit even a provisional report on the state of my work, but due to the specificity of the situation, I will make an exception. I have the impression, I repeat, I have the impression, no more for the time being, that there is truth in the supposition of colleague Kelvin. I mean his hypothesis of a neutrino structure... We know such systems only theoretically, we didn&#39;t know that they could be stabilized. There is a definite chance here, for the destruction of that force field that makes the system permanent... For some time now, I have noticed that the dark thing that covered the screen on the Sartorius side is moving: a crack lit up at the very top, and you could see something pink that was slowly moving there. Now the dark plane slid suddenly. - away! Away!!! Sartorius&#39; scream echoed through the receiver. In the suddenly brightened screen, between the doctor&#39;s struggling hands, clad in puffed sleeves, such as are used in laboratories, a large, golden disc-like object shone, and everything went out before I could even comprehend that the golden circle was a straw hat. .. - Snaut? I said taking a deep breath. &quot;Yes, Kelvin,&quot; replied the weary voice of the cyberneticist. I felt at that moment that I liked him. I really didn&#39;t want to know who was with him. We&#39;ve had enough for now, haven&#39;t we? &quot;I think so,&quot; I replied. &quot;Look, if you could, come downstairs or into my cabin, okay?&quot; I added hastily so that he didn&#39;t have time to hang up the phone. &quot;All right,&quot; he said. - But I do not know when. And that was the end of the problematic discussion.
