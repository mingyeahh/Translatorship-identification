I lay in the dark room, numb, staring at the glowing face of the watch on my wrist for I don&#39;t know how long. I listened to my own breathing and wondered about something, but all this, staring at the greenish ring of numbers and surprise, was immersed in an indifference that I attributed to fatigue. I turned on my side, the bed was strangely wide, something was missing. I held my breath. There was complete silence. I froze. There was not the slightest murmur. hare? Why couldn&#39;t I hear her breathing? I began to run my hands over the sheets: I was alone. - Harry! I wanted to speak, but I heard footsteps. Someone big and heavy, like... - Gibarian? I said calmly. - Yes, it&#39;s me. Don&#39;t turn on the light. - No? - There&#39;s no need to. It will be better for both of us. - But you&#39;re dead? - That `s nothing. Do you recognize my voice? - Yes. Why did you do that? - I had to. You&#39;re four days late. If you&#39;d arrived earlier, maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been necessary, but don&#39;t blame yourself. I&#39;m not bad. - Are you really here? &quot;Ah, you think I&#39;m dreaming, how did you think about Harey?&quot; - Where she is? - How do you know I know? - My guess is. - Keep it to yourself. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m here instead of her. But I want her to be too. - It is impossible. - Why? Look, but do you know it&#39;s really not you, it&#39;s me? - No. It&#39;s really me. If you wanted to be pedantic, you could say it&#39;s me again. But let&#39;s not waste words. - Will you leave? - Yes. - And then she&#39;ll come back? - You care about it? What is she to you? - It&#39;s my thing. - You&#39;re afraid of her. - No. - And you disgust... - What do you want from me? You can pity yourself, not her. She will always be twenty. Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know it! All of a sudden, I don&#39;t know why, I cooled down. I listened to him quite calmly. It seemed to me that he was closer now, at the foot of the bed, but still I couldn&#39;t see anything in the darkness. - What do you want? I asked quietly. My tone seemed to surprise him. He was silent for a moment. - Sartorius convinced Snaut that you deceived him. Now they will deceive you. Under the guise of installing X-ray equipment, they build a field annihilator. - Where she is? I asked. - Didn&#39;t you hear what I told you? I warned you! - Where she is? - I do not know. Be careful: you will need a weapon. You can&#39;t count on anyone. &quot;I can count on Harey,&quot; I said. I heard a quiet, quick sound. He laughed. - Of course you can. Up to a certain limit. After all, you can always do what I do. - You&#39;re not a Gibarian. - Please. and who? your dream maybe? - No. Their dummy. But you don&#39;t know it. - And how do you know who you are! This made me wonder. I wanted to get up, but I couldn&#39;t. Gibarian was saying something. I did not understand the words, I heard only the sound of his voice, I fought desperately against the weakness of my body, once again with the greatest effort I jerked ... and woke up. I was gasping for air like a half-suffocated fish. It was quite dark. It&#39;s a dream. Nightmare. Wait... &quot;a dilemma we can&#39;t solve. We are persecuting ourselves. The Polytheria merely used a kind of selective amplifier of our thoughts. The search for the motivation of this phenomenon is anthropomorphism. Where there are no people, there are also no motives available to man. In order to continue the research agenda, one must either annihilate one&#39;s own thoughts or their material realization. The first is beyond our power. The second is too much like murder. I listened in the darkness to that measured, distant voice, the sound of which I recognized immediately: it was Gibarian speaking. I stretched out my hands. The bed was empty. I woke up to another dream, I thought. my voice broke off immediately, in the middle of a word. Something clicked softly and I felt a faint breeze on my face. &quot;Well, Gibarian,&quot; I murmured, yawning. Gibarian!&quot; I repeated louder. The springs of the bed shook. &quot;Kris... it&#39;s me...&quot; a whisper sounded right next to me, &quot;It&#39;s you, Harey... and Gibarian?&quot; &quot;Kris... Kris... it&#39;s him no... you yourself said he was dead... &quot;He may be alive in a dream,&quot; I said slowly. I was no longer sure it was a dream. &quot;He said something. He was here,&quot; I said. I was terribly sleepy. I&#39;m asleep, I thought idiotically, brushing my lips against Harey&#39;s cool shoulder and getting more comfortable. in oblivion. In the morning, in a red-lit room, I remembered the events of that night. I dreamed of talking to Gibarian, but after that? I heard his voice, I could have sworn on it, I just couldn&#39;t remember what he was saying. It didn&#39;t sound like a conversation, more like a lecture. Lecture...? Harley was washing up. I heard the splash of water in the bathroom. I looked under the bed where I had thrown the tape recorder a few days ago. He wasn&#39;t there. - Harry! I called. Her dripping face appeared from behind the wardrobe. - Have you ever seen a tape recorder under the bed? A small, pocket-sized... - There were all sorts of things in there. I put everything there.&quot; She pointed to a shelf by the medicine cabinet and disappeared into the bathroom. I jumped out of bed, but the search yielded no results. &quot;You must have seen him,&quot; I said when she came back into the room. She said nothing as she combed her hair in front of the mirror. Only now did I notice that she was pale, and there was something searching in her eyes as they met mine in the mirror. &quot;Harey,&quot; I started like a donkey again, &quot;the tape recorder isn&#39;t on the shelf.&quot; - Don&#39;t you have anything more important to tell me...? &quot;Sorry,&quot; I muttered, &quot;you&#39;re right, it&#39;s stupid. That was all we needed to start arguing! Then we went to breakfast. Harey was doing everything differently than usual today, but I couldn&#39;t tell the difference. She looked at the surroundings, several times she did not hear what I was saying to her, as if falling into a sudden fixation. Once, when she raised her head, I saw her eyes glaze over. - What&#39;s wrong? I lowered my voice to a whisper. - Are you crying? - Oh, leave me alone. These aren&#39;t real tears, she stammered. Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have stopped there, but there was nothing I feared so much as &quot;honest conversations.&quot; Besides, I had other things on my mind, and although I knew that the plots of Snaut and Sartorius had only been in my dreams, I began to wonder if there was any on the Station at all. I didn&#39;t think about what I would do with it, I just wanted to have it. I told Harey I had to look into the holds and the storage rooms. She followed me silently. I couldn&#39;t resist the urge to peek into the cooler, but I didn&#39;t want Harey to go in there, so I just opened the door a crack and took my eyes around the room. to see if the black one is still where it was before. The place seemed empty. I couldn&#39;t find anything that suited me, and I wandered around in a worse and worse mood until I suddenly realized that I couldn&#39;t see Harey. Zar and she came anyway - she stayed in the corridor - but the fact that she tried to get away from me, which was so difficult for her, even for a moment, should have made me think. But I still acted like I don&#39;t know who, or just like a moron. My head ached, I couldn&#39;t find any pills, and angry as hell I turned the entire contents of the first aid kit upside down. I didn&#39;t want to go to the operating room again, I was as clumsy as rarely that day. Harey wandered like a shadow around the cabin, sometimes disappearing for a while, in the afternoon, after we had eaten dinner (actually, she didn&#39;t eat at all, and I, with no appetite, because of my bursting headache, did not even try to encourage her to eat), suddenly sat down next to me and started picking at the sleeve of my sweatshirt. - Well, what&#39;s up? I murmured mechanically. I wanted to go upstairs because the pipes seemed to carry a faint tapping echo that told me Sartorius was fiddling with the high-voltage equipment, but I suddenly felt like I&#39;d have to go with Harey, whose presence in the library was still on. half explainable, there among the machines, might give Snaut an opportunity for some untimely remark. &quot;Kris,&quot; she whispered, &quot;how are we...?&quot; I sighed involuntarily, I can&#39;t say it was my lucky day. - As best as possible. What is it about again? - I&#39;d like to talk to you. - Please. Listen. - But not like that. - How? Well, I told you, you know, my head hurts, I&#39;m in a lot of trouble... - A little good will, Kris. I forced a smile. He was miserable for sure. - Yes honey. speak. - Will you tell me the truth? I raised my eyebrows. I didn&#39;t like that start. - Why would I lie? - You may have reasons. Serious. But if you want... well, you know... then don&#39;t lie to me. I was silent. I&#39;ll tell you something and you&#39;ll tell me something. Okay? It will be true. No matter what. I didn&#39;t meet her eyes, although she was looking for my eyes, I pretended not to see it. &quot;I already told you, I don&#39;t know how I got here. But maybe you know. Wait, me too. Maybe you don&#39;t know. But if you know, and you just can&#39;t tell me now, then maybe later, someday? It won&#39;t be the worst. Anyway, give me a chance. I felt an icy current running through my body. - Baby, what are you saying? What chance...? I babbled. - Kris, whoever I am, I&#39;m definitely not a child. you promised. Say. That &#39;whoever I am&#39; got me so caught up in my throat that I could only stare at her, stupidly denying it with my head as if I was trying to prevent myself from hearing everything. I&#39;m not hiding anything...&quot; I answered hoarsely. &quot;That&#39;s perfect,&quot; she replied, getting up. I wanted to say something. I felt I couldn&#39;t leave her like this, but all the words were stuck in my throat. &quot;Harey...&quot; She was standing at the window with her back turned. the empty ocean lay under the naked sky.&quot; &quot;Harey, if you think that... Harey, you know I love you...&quot; &quot;Me? I went over to her. I wanted to hug her. She freed herself by pushing her hand away. &quot;You are so &quot;Do you love me? I&#39;d rather you hit me!&quot; &quot;Harey, darling!&quot; &quot;No! No. Better be silent.&quot; the shadow of the Station moved steadily on the waves Harey&#39;s jaw dropped to the floor. Water gurgled in the sinks. The red color turned to dirty red gold at the edges of the sky. If I knew what to do. Oh, if I knew. Suddenly it became quiet. Harry stood right behind me. - No. Don&#39;t turn around,&quot; she said, lowering her voice to a whisper. - You&#39;re not to blame, Kris. I know. Do not worry. I extended my hand towards her. She fled to the back of the cabin and, picking up a whole stack of plates, said: - Too bad. If they could break, I&#39;d break, oh I&#39;d break them all!!! For a moment I thought she was really throwing them to the ground, but she looked at me sharply and smiled. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t make a scene. I woke up in the middle of the night, immediately tense and alert, and sat up in bed; the room was dark, a faint light from the corridor shone through the half-open door. Something hissed venomously, the sound increasing with muffled, dull thuds, as if something large was thumping violently against the wall. Meteor! thought flashed. - Pierced armor. There is someone! Prolonged wheezing. I sobered up the rest. It was the Station, not a rocket, and that awful sound... I ran out into the corridor. The door of the small studio was wide open, there was a light in there. I ran inside. A blast of terrible cold swept over me. The cabin was filled with steam, turning breath into snow. White flakes swirled over the bathrobe-wrapped body, which was thumping weakly on the floor. As soon as I saw her, in that icy cloud, I rushed to her, grabbed her waist, the cloak burned my hands, she wheezed, I ran out into the corridor, past the rows of doors, I did not feel the cold anymore, only her breath coming out of my mouth in clouds of steam like a flame burned me shoulder. I folded her on the table, ripped the cloak over her chest, stared into her severed, twitching face for a second, the blood froze on her open mouth, blackened her lips, ice crystals gleamed on her tongue... Liquid oxygen. There was liquid oxygen in the lab, in Dewar vessels, I felt like I was breaking crisp glass as I lifted her. How much could she drink? Does not matter. Burnt trachea, throat, lungs, liquid oxygen eats more than concentrated acids. Her breath, rasping, dry as the sound of torn papers, was shallow. Her eyes were closed. Agony. I looked at the great glass cabinets with tools and medicine. Tracheotomy? Intubation? But no more lungs! They are burned. Medicines? So many drugs! Rows of colorful bottles and boxes filled the shelves. Snoring filled the room, mist still flowing from her open mouth. Hot water bottles... I started looking for them, but before I found them, I jumped to the other cupboard, threw boxes of ampoules, now a syringe, where, in sterilizers, I couldn&#39;t fold it with numb hands, my fingers were stiff and wouldn&#39;t bend. I banged my hand furiously on the lid of the sterilizer, but I didn&#39;t feel it, the only response was a faint tingling. The lying one wheezed louder. I jumped to her. Her eyes were open. - Harry! It wasn&#39;t even a whisper. I couldn&#39;t get my voice out. I had a strange, intrusive face, like plaster. Her ribs flew under her white skin, her hair, wet from the melting snow, spilled over the headboard. She was looking at me. - Harry! I couldn&#39;t say anything else. I stood like a block with these alien wooden hands, feet, lips, eyelids began to burn more and more, but I hardly felt it, a drop of blood dissolving in the warmth ran down her cheek, drawing a diagonal line. Her tongue twitched and disappeared, she was still wheezing. I took hold of her wrist, which was pulseless, and pulled the tails of my coat apart, and put my ear to the bitterly cold flesh just below her breast. Over a crackling noise like fire, I heard a thud, galloping tones too fast to count. I was standing, bent low, eyes closed, when something touched my head. She slipped her fingers into my hair. I looked into her eyes. &quot;Kris,&quot; she wheezed. I took her hand, she responded with a grip that almost crushed my hand, consciousness fled from her horribly contorted face, whites glistened between her eyelids, her throat snored and her whole body vomited. I could barely hold it, slung over the edge of the table. She banged her head against the edge of the porcelain funnel. I held her up and pinned her to the table, each time she spasms, she would break away from me, I was sweating instantly and my legs felt like jelly. When the vomiting subsided, I tried to lay her down. She crowed gasping for air. Suddenly Harey&#39;s eyes lit up in that terrible, bloody face. &quot;Kris,&quot; she wheezed, &quot;how... how long, Kris?&quot; She began to choke, frothing at the mouth, vomiting again. I held her with all my might. She fell onto her back until her teeth chattered and panted. &quot;No, no, no,&quot; she blurted out quickly with each exhalation, each one felt like her last. But the vomit came back again, and she threw herself into my arms again, sucking in breaths in short intervals with an effort that made all the ribs stick out. At last the eyelids slid halfway over her open, blind eyes. She froze. I thought it was over. I didn&#39;t even try to wipe the pink foam from her mouth, I was standing over her, leaning over her, hearing some distant, great bell, waiting for her last breath to drop to the floor, but she was still breathing, hardly a wheeze, quieter and quieter, and the tip chest, which had almost ceased to vibrate, was moving with the rapid rhythm of a beating heart. I stood hunched over as her face began to turn pink. I didn&#39;t understand anything yet. Only the insides of both my hands became wet, and I thought I was going deaf, something soft and elastic filled my ears, but I could still hear the ringing bell, now as deaf as a broken heart. She lifted her eyelids and our eyes met. &quot;Harey,&quot; I wanted to say, but my mouth seemed to be missing, my face was a dead, heavy mask, and I could only stare. Her eyes darted around the room, her head moved. It was quite quiet. Behind me, in some other, distant world, water was dripping steadily from an unscrewed tap. She raised herself on an elbow. She sat down. I stepped back. She was watching me. &quot;What,&quot; she said, &quot;what...?&quot; Failed to? Why...? Why are you looking like that...? And suddenly, in a terrible scream: - Why are you looking like that!!! Silence fell. She looked at her hands. She moved her fingers. - It&#39;s me...? - she said. &quot;Harey,&quot; I said breathlessly, using only my lips. She raised her head. - Harry...? she repeated. She slid slowly to the floor and stood. She staggered, regained her balance, took a few steps forward. She did all this in a sort of stupor, looking at me as if she didn&#39;t see me. - Harey? she repeated slowly again. - But... I... I&#39;m not Harey. And who - me?... Harey? And you, you?! Suddenly her eyes widened, flashed, and a shadow of a smile of utter astonishment lit up her face. - Maybe you too? Kris! Maybe you too?! I stayed silent, leaning my back against the wardrobe where fear pushed me. Her hands dropped. - She did not tell. - -No, because you&#39;re afraid. But, listen, I can&#39;t. You can not do this. I didn&#39;t know anything. I now, I still don&#39;t understand anything. It&#39;s not possible? I - she pressed her clenched, bleached hands to her chest - I know nothing but, except Harey! Do you think I&#39;m pretending? I&#39;m not pretending, holy word, I&#39;m not pretending. The last words turned into a groan. She fell to the floor sobbing, that scream as if it shattered something inside me, in one leap I got to her, grabbed her arms, she defended herself, pushed me away sobbing without tears, screaming: - Let go! Let go! you are disgusting! I know! I don&#39;t want that! I don&#39;t want! You see, you see, it&#39;s not me, not me, not me... - Be silent! I shouted shaking her, we both screamed unconsciously, kneeling in front of each other. Harey&#39;s head flew, pounding against my shoulder, and I pressed it against me with all my strength. We suddenly froze, panting heavily. Water was dripping steadily from the faucet. - Kris... - she stammered pressing her face into my shoulder - tell me what should I do to be gone, Kris... - Stop it! I shouted. She lifted her face. She was staring at me. - How...? you don&#39;t know either? Can&#39;t do anything? Nothing? - Harey... have mercy... - I wanted to... you saw it. No. No. Let go, I don&#39;t want you touching me! you are disgusted. - Not true! - You&#39;re lying. You must be disgusted. I... myself... too. If I could. If only I could... - You&#39;d kill yourself. - Yes. - And I don&#39;t want to, do you understand? I don&#39;t want you to kill yourself. I want you here with me, and I don&#39;t need anything else! Huge gray eyes consumed me. &quot;How are you lying...&quot; she said quite quietly. I released her and got up from my knees. She sat on the floor. - Tell me, what should I do to make you believe that I say what I think? That it&#39;s true. There is no other. - You can&#39;t tell the truth. I&#39;m not Harry. - Who are you? She was silent for a long moment. Her chin twitched a few times until she lowered her head and whispered, &quot;Harey... but... but I know it&#39;s not true.&quot; It wasn&#39;t me... you loved back there, in the past... &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. - What was is no more. It died. But you, here, I love. Understand? She shook her head. - You are good. Don&#39;t think I can&#39;t appreciate everything you&#39;ve done. You did it the best you could. But he can&#39;t help it. When I sat by your bed in the morning three days ago, waiting for you to wake up, I knew nothing. It seems like a very, very long time ago. I acted like a madman. I had a fog in my head. I couldn&#39;t remember what happened before or after, and I wasn&#39;t surprised by anything, just like after anesthesia or after a long illness. And I even thought maybe I was sick, you just don&#39;t want to tell me. But then more and more things got me thinking. You know what things. Something dawned on me after your conversation there in the library, with what&#39;s his name, with Snaut. And since you didn&#39;t want to say anything, I got up in the middle of the night and played that tape recorder. I only lied that one time because I hid it afterwards, Kris. The one who said what was his name? - Gibarian. - Yes, Gibarian. Then I understood everything, although to be honest, I still don&#39;t understand anything. One thing I didn&#39;t know was that I couldn&#39;t... that I wasn&#39;t... that it would end like this... endlessly. He didn&#39;t say anything about it. Maybe he did, but you woke up and I turned off the tape. Still, I had heard enough to know that I was not a human, but an instrument. - What are you talking about? - Yes. To study your reactions or something. You all have one like me. It is based on memories or imaginations, repressed. Somehow. Besides, you know all this better than me. He said such terrible, unbelievable things, and if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that everything was right, I wouldn&#39;t have believed it! - What was right? - Well, that I don&#39;t need sleep and that I need to be with you all the time. Yesterday morning I still thought you hated me, and I was unhappy about it. God, how stupid I was! But tell me, tell me, could I have imagined? After all, he didn&#39;t hate his one at all, but how he talked about her! Only then did I realize that whatever I did, it didn&#39;t matter, because whether I wanted to or not, it must be like torture for you. In fact, it&#39;s even worse, because the torture device is as dead and innocent as a stone that can fall and kill. And that a tool could wish and love well, I couldn&#39;t imagine. I wish I could at least tell you what was going on in me then, after I understood, after I listened to that tape. Maybe you&#39;d at least get some use out of it. I even tried to write it down... - Is that why you turned on the light? I asked, struggling to make my voice suddenly choke. - Yes. But nothing came of it. Because I was looking in myself, you know... - them - that something else, I was completely crazy, I tell you! It seemed to me for some time that I had no body under my skin, that there was something else in me, that I was only a surface. To deceive you. Understand? - I see. - When you lie like this for hours at night, thinking can go very far and in very strange directions, you know... - I know... - But I felt my heart, and anyway I remembered that you tested my blood. What is my blood, tell me, tell me the truth. You can now. - Same as mine. - Really? - I promise you. - What does it mean? You know, I thought later that maybe it&#39;s hidden somewhere in me, that it is ... after all, it can be very small. But I didn&#39;t know where. I think now that it was actually an excuse on my part because I was very afraid of what I wanted to do and was looking for some other way out. But, Kris, if I have the same blood... if it&#39;s what you say, then... No, that&#39;s impossible. I wouldn&#39;t be alive, would I? That means there is something, but where? Maybe in your head? But I think quite simply... and I don&#39;t know anything... If I thought that, I should know everything right away and not love you, just pretend and know that I&#39;m pretending... Kris, please tell me everything, what do you know, but maybe we can do something? - What is to be done? She was silent. - Do you want to die? - I think so. There was silence again. I stood hunched over her, looking at the empty interior of the room, at the white enamel plates, at the shiny, scattered tools, as if looking for something badly needed, and I couldn&#39;t find it. &quot;Harey, can I say something too?&quot; She waited. &quot;It&#39;s true that you&#39;re not quite like me. But that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re any worse. Contrary. You can think what you want anyway, but thanks to this... you didn&#39;t die. A childish, pitiful smile spread over her face. &quot;Does that mean I&#39;m... immortal?&quot; - I do not know. In any case, you&#39;re far less mortal than I am. &quot;It&#39;s terrible,&quot; she whispered. - Maybe not as much as you think. - But you don&#39;t envy me... - Harey, it&#39;s more a matter of your... destiny, so to speak. You know, here on the Station, your destiny is basically as dark as mine or any of ours. They&#39;ll continue Gibarian&#39;s experiment, and anything can happen... - Or nothing. &quot;Or nothing, and I&#39;ll tell you, I&#39;d rather nothing happen, not even because of fear (although I guess that plays a role too, I don&#39;t know), but because it won&#39;t do any good.&quot; Of this one thing I am absolutely sure. - It won&#39;t work, why? It&#39;s about this... ocean? She shuddered. - Yes. For contact. I think it&#39;s actually extremely simple. Contact means exchanging some experiences, concepts, or at least results, some states, but what if there is nothing to exchange? If an elephant is not a very large bacterium, then the ocean cannot be a very large brain. There may, of course, be action on both sides. As a result of one, I am looking at you now and trying to explain to you that you are dearer to me than the twelve years of my life I have devoted to Solaris, and that I want to be with you further. Maybe your coming was supposed to be torture, maybe a favor, maybe just a microscopic examination. An expression of friendship, a sneaky blow, maybe a mockery? Maybe all at once, or what seems to me most likely something else entirely, but what do you and I really care about the intentions of our parents, however different they may be? You can say that our future depends on these intentions, and I agree with that. I can&#39;t predict what will happen. Just like you. I can&#39;t even assure you that I will always love you. If so much has happened, anything can happen. Maybe I&#39;ll become a green jellyfish tomorrow? It does not depend on us. But in this. what&#39;s up to us, we&#39;ll be together. Isn&#39;t that enough? &quot;Listen...&quot; she said, &quot;there&#39;s something else.&quot; Do I... am I... very similar to her? &quot;You were very similar,&quot; I said, &quot;but now I don&#39;t know.&quot; - How is it...? She got up from the ground and looked at me with wide eyes. - You&#39;ve already covered it. &quot;And you&#39;re sure it&#39;s not her, but me?&quot; Me...? - Yes. You. I do not know. I&#39;m afraid if you really were her, I couldn&#39;t love you. - Why? - Because I did something terrible. - Her? - Yes. When we were... - Don&#39;t tell. - Why? Because I want you to know that I&#39;m not her.
