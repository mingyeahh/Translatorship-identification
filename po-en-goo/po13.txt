The next three weeks were like one and the same day, repeating itself over and over again, window covers going up and down, at night I crawled from one nightmare to another, in the morning we would get up and the game would start, but was it a game? I feigned calm and Harey feigned it, that tacit understanding, the knowledge of each other&#39;s deception, became our last refuge. Because we talked a lot about how we would live on Earth, how we would settle somewhere near a big city and never leave the blue sky and green trees again, and we thought up the interior of our future house and garden together, and we even argued about the details... about the hedge, about the bench... did I believe it for a second? No. I knew it was impossible. I knew about it. Because even if she could leave the Station - alive - only a man can land on Earth, and a man is his papers. The first check would end this escape. They&#39;d try to identify her, so they&#39;d disconnect us first, and that would betray her immediately. The station was the only place we could live together. Did Harry know about this? Definitely. Did someone tell her that? In light of everything that&#39;s happened, I guess so. One night I heard Harey get up quietly in my sleep. I wanted to hug her. Only by being silent, only in the darkness, could we become free for a while, in a lostness that the despair surrounding us made only a momentary suspension of the torture. She didn&#39;t seem to notice that I woke up. By the time I reached out, she was off the bed. I heard - still only half awake - the sound of bare feet. A vague fear gripped me. - Harey? I whispered. I wanted to scream, but I didn&#39;t dare. I sat on the bed. The door leading to the corridor was only closed. A thin needle of light slanted across the cabin. I thought I heard muffled voices. Was she talking to someone? With whom? I jumped out of bed, but such terrible fear seized me that my legs refused to obey me. I stood listening for a while - it was quiet. I slowly dragged myself to bed. Pulse pounded in his head. I started counting. At 1,000 I stopped, the door swung open noiselessly, Harey slid inside and stood still, as if listening to my breathing. I tried to make it measured. - Chris...? she whispered softly. I didn&#39;t answer. She slid quickly into bed. I felt her stretched out and lay beside her, limp for I don&#39;t know how long. I tried to structure the questions, but the more time passed, the more I understood that I would not speak first. After a while, maybe an hour later, I fell asleep. The morning was the same as always. I only eyed her suspiciously when she couldn&#39;t see it. After dinner, we sat side by side in front of the curved window, through which low, red clouds floated. The station glided among them like a ship. Harey was reading a book, and I was in one of those obsessions that so often became the only respite now. I noticed that by tilting my head in a certain way, I could see both of us reflected in the glass, clear but clear. I took my hand off the railing. Harey - I saw it in the glass - after making sure with a quick glance that I was looking at the ocean, she leaned over the railing and touched her lips to it where I had just touched. I sat on, unnaturally stiff, and she bent her head over the book. &quot;Harey,&quot; I said softly, &quot;where did you go out last night?&quot; - In the night? - Yes. - Something... you dreamed, Kris. I never went out. - Didn&#39;t you go out? - No. You must have dreamed it. &quot;Maybe,&quot; I said. - Yes, it&#39;s possible that I dreamed ... In the evening, when we were already lying down, I started talking about our journey again, about returning to Earth. &quot;Ah, I don&#39;t want to hear about it,&quot; she said. - Don&#39;t talk, Kris. You know... - What? - Nothing. Nothing. When we were lying down, she said she was thirsty. - There, on the table, there is a glass of juice, please pass it to me. She drank half of it and handed it to me. I had no desire to drink. &quot;For my health,&quot; she smiled. I drank the juice, which I thought was a little salty, but I didn&#39;t notice it. &quot;If you don&#39;t want us to talk about Earth, then what?&quot; I asked as she turned off the light. - Would you get married if I wasn&#39;t there? - No. - Never? - Never. - Why? - I do not know. I&#39;ve been single for ten years and not married. Let&#39;s not talk about it, honey... My head was buzzing like I&#39;d drunk at least a bottle of wine. - No, let&#39;s talk, let&#39;s just talk. What if I asked you? - For me to get married? Nonsense, Harry. I don&#39;t need anyone but you. She bent over me. I felt her breath on my lips, she hugged me so tightly that the inexhaustible drowsiness that had gripped me receded for a moment. - Say it differently. - I love you. She bumped her forehead against my shoulder, and I felt her tense eyelids twitch and her tears wet. - Harley, what&#39;s up? - Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. she repeated more and more quietly. I tried to open my eyes, but they kept closing on their own. I don&#39;t know when I fell asleep. A red dawn woke me up. My head was lead and my neck was stiff, as if all the vertebrae had fused into one bone. I couldn&#39;t move my rough, nasty tongue in my mouth. I must have poisoned myself with something, I thought, lifting my head with an effort. I reached out to Harey. She landed on a cold sheet. I jumped up. The bed was empty, in the cabin - no one. The reflections of the sun&#39;s disk repeated themselves in red discs in the panes. I jumped to the floor. I must have looked ridiculous because I staggered drunk. I grabbed the equipment, I got to the wardrobe - the bathroom was empty. The corridor too. And there was no one in the studio. - Harry!!! I shouted in the middle of the corridor, rowing my hands unconsciously. &quot;Harey...&quot; I croaked once more, already knowing. I don&#39;t remember exactly what happened next. I had to run, half-naked, all over the station, I remember even falling into the cold store, and then into the last warehouse, and pounding on the sliding door with my fists. Maybe even been there a few times. The stairs rumbled, I tumbled, jumped, ran somewhere again, until I reached a transparent barrier, behind which there is an exit to the outside: double armored doors. I pushed it with all my might and screamed for it to be a dream. And someone had been with me for some time and was pulling me, dragging me somewhere. Then I was in the little study, shirt wet from icy water, hair matted, nostrils and tongue stinging with alcohol, half-lying, panting, on something cold, metal, and Snaut in his stained linen trousers bustling about the medicine cabinet, knocking over something that tools and glasses made a terrible noise. Suddenly I saw him in front of me, looking into my eyes, attentive, stooped. - Where she is? - She&#39;s not here. &quot;But, but Harey...&quot; &quot;Harey is gone,&quot; he said slowly, distinctly, bringing his face closer to mine as if he had struck me a blow, and now he was watching the effect. &quot;He&#39;ll be back...&quot; I whispered, closing my eyes. And for the first time, I wasn&#39;t really afraid of it. I had no fear of the spectral return. I didn&#39;t understand how I could ever be afraid of him! - Drink it. He handed me a glass of warm liquid. I looked at it and all of a sudden threw it in his face. He stepped back, wiping his eyes. When he opened them, I was standing over him. He was so small. - It&#39;s you?! - What are you talking about? - Don&#39;t lie, you know what. Were you the one who spoke to her that night? And you told her to give her a sleeping pill for this...? What have you done with her!? Speak!!! He searched his breasts. He took out a crumpled envelope. I snatched it from him. It was sealed. Nothing on top. I tore the paper. A piece of paper folded in four fell out. Large, somewhat childish handwriting in uneven rows. I met them. &quot;Honey, I was the first one to ask him. He is good. I&#39;m sorry I had to lie to you, there was no other way. You can do one thing for me - listen to him and do nothing to yourself. You were great.&quot; Underneath was one word crossed out I could read it: &quot;Harey&quot; she wrote, then she blurred it out, there was another letter like H or K turned into a blur. I read it again and again. And yet. I was too sober to be hysterical, I couldn&#39;t even groan or make a sound. - How? I whispered. - How? - Then, Kelvin. Hold on. - I&#39;m holding on. speak. How? - Annihilation. - How is it? But camera?! - it hit me. - Roche&#39;s camera was useless. Sarto-rius has built another special destabilizer. Small. It only works within a few meters. - What about her...? - She&#39;s gone. Flash and blast. Weak gust. Nothing more. - Within a small radius, you say? - Yes. There was no material for the big one. Suddenly the walls began to collapse on me. I closed my eyes. - God... she&#39;s... she&#39;ll be back, she&#39;ll be back... - No. - It&#39;s not...? - No, Kelvin. Remember those rising foams? They haven&#39;t come back since then. - Not any more? - No. &quot;You killed her,&quot; I said quietly. - Yes. You wouldn&#39;t do it? On my place? I got up and started walking faster and faster. From the wall to the corner and back. Nine steps. Return. Nine steps. I stood in front of him. - Listen, we&#39;ll file a report. We will request direct communication with the Council. It can be done. They&#39;ll agree. they must. The planet will be excluded from the convention of the Four. All means allowed. We&#39;ll bring in the antimatter generators. You think there&#39;s anything that can resist antimatter? There is nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I shouted triumphantly, blind from tears. - Do you want to destroy it? - he said. - For what? - Get out. Leave me! - I will not go. - Snaut! I looked him in the eye. &quot;No,&quot; he nodded. &quot;What do you want? What do you want from me?&quot; He stepped back to the table. &quot;Okay. We&#39;ll report.&quot; Second, our demands.&quot; &quot;Now do we have to talk about it?&quot; &quot;Yes, now.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want to. Understand? I don&#39;t care.&quot; &quot;You won&#39;t stop?&quot; I grabbed his arm. &quot;You can hit me,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&#39;ll keep talking. I let him go.&quot; &quot;Do whatever you want.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s just that Sartorius will try to hide certain facts. I am almost certain of it.&quot; &quot;And you don&#39;t?&quot; &quot;No. Not now. It&#39;s not just our business. It&#39;s all about, you know what it is. He&#39;s been acting intelligently. A capacity for organic synthesis of the highest order that we don&#39;t know. He knows structure, microstructure, the metabolism of our bodies... &quot;Okay,&quot; I said, &quot;Why did you stop talking? He did it on us.&quot; series... series... of experiences. Psychic vivisection. Based on knowledge stolen from our heads, regardless of what we strive for. “It&#39;s not facts or even conclusions anymore, Kelvin. These are hypotheses. In a way, he cared about what some closed, hidden part of our minds wanted. It could have been - gifts... - Gifts! Great God! I started laughing. &quot;Stop it,&quot; he shouted, grabbing my hand. I squeezed his fingers. I squeezed harder and harder until my knuckles cracked. He stared at me with narrowed eyes, unmoving. I let him go and went to the corner. Facing the wall, I said, &quot;I&#39;ll try not to get hysterical.&quot; - Never mind all that. What will we demand? - You tell. I can&#39;t now. Did she say anything before...? - No. Nothing. As for me, I think now is the chance. - Chance? what chance? For what? Ah ... - I said more quietly, looking into his eyes, because I suddenly understood. - Contact? Contact again? We don&#39;t have much left - and you, you, and this whole madhouse... Contact? No no no. Without me. - Why? he asked quite calmly. - Kelvin, you still, and now more than ever, instinctively treat him as a human being. you hate him. - And you do not...? - I threw. - No. Kelvin, he&#39;s blind... - Blind? I repeated, not sure if I heard right. - Of course, in our understanding. We do not exist for him as we do for each other. The surface of the face and body that we see makes us get to know each other as individuals. This is a transparent glass for him. After all, it penetrated inside our brains. - So good. So what? What are you going to? If he could animate, create a man who doesn&#39;t exist beyond my memory, so that her eyes, her movements, her voice... her voice... &quot;Keep talking!&quot; keep talking! you hear!!! - I say... I say... Yes. So... the voice... it follows that it can read us like a book. You know what I want to say? - Yes. That if he wanted to, he could communicate with us? - Naturally. Isn&#39;t it obvious? - No. Not at all. After all, he could only take a production prescription that does not consist of words. As a fixed memory record, it is a protein structure. Like a sperm head or an egg. After all, there are no words or feelings in the brain, the memory of a person is an image written in the language of nucleic acids on large-molecular asynchronous crystals. So he took what was apparently etched in us, the most closed, the fullest, the most deeply imprinted, you understand? But he didn&#39;t need to know what it meant to us, what it meant. It&#39;s like we can create a symmetriad and throw it into the ocean, knowing the architecture, technology and building materials, but not understanding what it&#39;s for, what it&#39;s for, what it means to him... &quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; I said. - Yes, it&#39;s possible. In that case, he didn&#39;t... maybe he didn&#39;t want to step on us like that and crush us. May be. And just unintentionally... My mouth started to fly. - Kelvin! - Yes Yes. Okay? Nothing. You are good. He too. Everyone is good. But why? Explain to me. Why? Did he do it for something? What did you say to her? - Truth. - Truth, truth! What? - But you know. Come to me now. We will write a report. Come on. - Wait. What do you actually want? You&#39;re not going to stay at the station, are you...? -I want to stay. Yes.
