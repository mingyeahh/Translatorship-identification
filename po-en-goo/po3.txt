I hastily folded Gibarian&#39;s notes in four and pocketed them. I walked slowly over to the closet and looked inside - overalls and clothes were crammed together and crammed into one corner, as if someone had been standing there. The corner of an envelope was sticking out from under a pile of papers on the floor. I picked her up. It was addressed to me. With a sudden lump in my throat, I ripped open the envelope and had to force myself to unfold the small piece of paper that was stuck inside. In his regular hand, extremely small but legible, Gibarian wrote: Ann. solar. Vol. I. Anex, also: Vot. Separat. Messenger in the case of F; Ravintzer&#39;s Little Apocrypha. That was all, not one more word. The writing bore signs of haste. Was it some important message? When did he write it? I thought I had to go to the library as soon as possible. I knew this annex to the first solarist yearbook, that is, I knew of its existence, but I never had it in my hands, because it was of purely historical value. But I&#39;ve never even heard of a Ravintzer or his &quot;Little Apocrypha.&quot; What should I do? I&#39;m already fifteen minutes late. Once again, from the door, I took in the whole room. There was an unrolled Solaris map. There was something hanging behind the map. It was a pocket tape recorder in a case. I took out the camera, put the case back in its place, and put the tape recorder in my pocket. I looked at the counter - almost the entire reel was recorded. Again I stood for a second at the door with my eyes closed. I listened with effort to the silence outside, nothing. a circular chamber from which corridors branched out like the spokes of a wheel, when, passing a narrow side passage that seemed to lead to the bathrooms, I saw many an indistinct figure, almost merging with the semi-darkness. I stopped transfixed. From the depths of this branch walked an unhurried, waddling gait of a huge black woman. I saw the flash of her whites and almost simultaneously heard the soft, bare slaps of her feet. She wore nothing but a shiny yellow skirt, as if made of straw; she had enormous, pendulous breasts, and black arms the size of a normal human&#39;s thighs; it passed me without so much as a glance in my direction - a meter away - and went on, swaying in its elephantine billows, like those Stone Age steatopygic carvings you sometimes see in anthropology museums. Where the corridor curved, she turned to the side and disappeared through the door of Gibarian&#39;s cabin. As she opened them, she stood for a moment in the stronger light that burned in the room. The door closed silently and I was alone. I took the wrist of my left hand in my right hand and squeezed it with all my strength until the bones cracked. I looked around absently at my surroundings. What happened? What was that? As suddenly as if someone had hit me, I remembered Snaut&#39;s warning. What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Who was this monstrous Aphrodite? Where did it come from? I took one, just one step towards Gibarian&#39;s cabin and froze. I knew all too well that I wouldn&#39;t go in there. I gasped for air with my widened nostrils. Something wasn&#39;t right, something wasn&#39;t right - ah! Instinctively, I expected the foul, distinct stench of her sweat, but even as she passed me a step, I felt nothing. I don&#39;t know how long I stood against the cool metal of the wall. Silence filled the station, the only audible sound being the distant, monotonous hum of the air-conditioning compressors. I slapped my face lightly with my open hand and slowly walked to the radio station. As I turned the handle, I heard a sharp voice: - Who&#39;s there? - It&#39;s me, Kelvin. He was sitting at a table between a stack of aluminum boxes and a transmitter console, eating meat concentrate straight from a can. I don&#39;t know why he chose a radio station for his apartment. I stood dumbfounded at the door, staring at his steadily chewing jaws, and suddenly I felt how hungry I was. I went to the shelves, picked the least dusty plate from the pile, and sat down across from him. We ate in silence for a while, then Snaut got up, took a thermos flask from the wall cupboard, and poured us each a glass of hot broth. Putting the thermos on the floor, there was no room left on the table, he asked: - Have you seen Sartorius? - No. Where is he? - On top. There was a lab upstairs. We ate in silence as the tin grated in the empty can. It was night at the radio station. The window was closed tightly from the outside, four round fluorescent lamps were burning in the ceiling. Their reflections vibrated in the plastic cover of the transmitter. Red veins lined the taut skin of Snaut&#39;s cheekbones. He was now wearing a black, loose, tattered sweater. - Do you have anything? he asked. - No. What&#39;s going to happen to me? - You&#39;re sweating. I wiped my forehead with my hand. I was indeed dripping sweat; it must have been a reaction from the previous shock. He looked at me searchingly. Should I have told him? I wish he had shown me more confidence. Who was playing against whom and in what incomprehensible way? &quot;It&#39;s hot,&quot; I said. &quot;I thought the air-conditioning worked better for you.&quot; &quot;It&#39;ll even out in about an hour.&quot; Are you sure it&#39;s just from the heat? he looked up at me. I chewed conscientiously as if I hadn&#39;t seen it. - What are you going to do? he finally asked when we had finished eating. He dumped the entire dish and empty cans into the washroom by the wall and returned to his chair. &quot;I will comply with you,&quot; I replied phlegmatically. Do you have a research plan? Some new stimulus, supposedly X-ray or something, right? - X-ray? he raised his eyebrows. - Where did you hear about it? - I don&#39;t remember anymore. Someone told me. Maybe on Prometheus. What? Are you doing it already? - I do not know the details. It was Gibarian&#39;s idea. He started it with Sartorius. But how can you know about it? I shrugged. - Don&#39;t know the details? You should be there, because it&#39;s within your scope - I didn&#39;t finish. He was silent. The whines coming from the air conditioners died down, and the temperature remained at a bearable level. There was only a constant high pitch in the air, like the buzzing of a dying fly. Snaut got up, walked over to the control panel, and began clicking contacts pointlessly, because the main switch was in the dead position. He played with it for a while, and without turning his head, he noticed: - We will have to complete the formalities in connection with this ... you know. - Yes? He turned and looked at me as if close to fury. I cannot say that I deliberately tried to upset him, but not understanding anything of the game that was going on here, I preferred to be restrained. A bony apple was crawling over the black tube of his sweater. &quot;You were with Gibarian,&quot; he said suddenly. It wasn&#39;t a question. I raised my eyebrows and looked him calmly in the face. &quot;You were in his room,&quot; he repeated. I made a small movement of my head, as if to say &quot;let&#39;s say&quot;, &quot;let&#39;s say&quot;. I wanted him to keep talking. - Who was there? he asked. Knew about her!!! - No one. And who could be there? I asked. - Then why didn&#39;t you let me in? I smiled. - Because I got scared. After your warning, when the doorknob moved, I held it instinctively. Why didn&#39;t you say it was you? I would have let you in. &quot;I thought it was Sartorius,&quot; he said uncertainly. - So what of it? - What do you think about... what happened there? - he answered the question with a question. I hesitated. - You must know better than me. Where is he? &quot;In the cooler,&quot; he replied immediately. - We moved him early in the morning... because of the heat. - Where did you find him? - In the wardrobe. - In the closet? Was he dead? His heart was still beating, but he wasn&#39;t breathing. It was agony. - Did you try to save him? - No. - Why? He hesitated. - I did not make it. He died before I put him down. - Was it in the closet? Between these overalls? - Yes. He walked over to a small desk in the corner and fetched a sheet from it. He put it in front of me. &quot;I wrote up a makeshift protocol,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s even good that you&#39;ve seen your room.&quot; Cause of death... injection of a lethal dose of pernostal. There you have it written... I ran my eyes through the short text. &quot;Suicide...&quot; I repeated softly. - And the reason...? - An upset... depression... or whatever you want to call it. You know this better than me. &quot;I only know what I see,&quot; I replied, looking down into his eyes as he was standing over me. - What do you mean by that? he asked calmly. &quot;He injected himself with pernostal and hid in a closet, right?&quot; If so, it was not depression, not an upset, but acute psychosis. Para-noia... He must have thought he saw something... I spoke slowly, looking into his eyes. He walked away to the radio console and started clicking contacts again. &quot;Here&#39;s your signature,&quot; I said after a moment of silence. - And Sartorius? - He&#39;s in the lab. I already told you. Doesn&#39;t show: I suppose... - That what? - That it shut down. - Locked up? Ah. He disappeared. Please. Maybe he barricaded himself? - Maybe. &quot;Snaut...&quot; I said, &quot;there is someone on the Station.&quot; - Did you see?! He looked at me, bent over. - You warned me. before whom? Is it a hallucination? - What did you see!? - He&#39;s a man, isn&#39;t he? He was silent. He turned to the wall as if he didn&#39;t want me to watch his face. He drummed his fingers on the metal partition. I looked at his hands. There was no blood left on the ankles. I had a brief, like a flash, epiphany. &quot;This person is real,&quot; I said softly, almost in a whisper, as if I were telling him a secret that could be overheard. - What? You can... touch her. She can... be hurt... last time you saw her was today. - How do you know!? He didn&#39;t turn around. He was standing against the wall, his chest against her as my words hit him. - Just before I landed... Not long before...? He shrank as if from a blow. I saw his crazy eyes. - You?!!! - he choked out - who are you!? He looked like he wanted to pounce on me. I didn&#39;t expect that. The situation turned upside down. He didn&#39;t believe I was who I said I was? What&#39;s that supposed to mean!? He looked at me with the utmost horror. Was it already a mistake? Poisoning? Everything became possible. But I saw her - this creature, and therefore I myself ... also ...? - Who it was? I asked. The words reassured him. He looked at me searchingly for a moment, as if he didn&#39;t believe me yet. I already knew it was a false pull and that he wouldn&#39;t answer me before he even opened his mouth. He sat down slowly in the chair and clasped his head in his hands. - What is going on here...? he said quietly. - Maligna... - Who was it? I asked again. &quot;If you don&#39;t know...&quot; he muttered. - What? - That `s nothing. &quot;Snaut,&quot; I said, &quot;we&#39;re far enough from home.&quot; Let&#39;s play open cards. Everything is still messed up. - What do you mean? - To tell you who you saw. - And you...? he said suspiciously. - You&#39;re chasing in heel. I will tell you and you will tell me. You can be calm, I won&#39;t take you for a madman, because I know... - For a madman! Great God! he tried to laugh. - Man, but you nothing, nothing at all ... but it would be a salvation. If he had believed for a moment that it was madness, he wouldn&#39;t have done it, he would have lived... - So what you wrote in the report about the disorder is a lie? - Of course! - Why don&#39;t you write the truth? - Why...? he repeated. Silence fell. I was in complete darkness again, unable to understand anything, and for a moment it seemed to me that I could convince him that we would attack the riddle together. Why, why wouldn&#39;t he talk?! - Where are the vending machines? I replied. - In warehouses. We have closed all except airport services. - Why? He didn&#39;t answer again. - You will not tell? - I can&#39;t. There was something about it that I couldn&#39;t grasp. Maybe go upstairs to Sartorius? Suddenly I remembered the card, and that seemed to me the most important thing at that moment. - Can you imagine further work in such conditions? I asked. He shrugged contemptuously. - What does it matter? - Ah yes? So what are you going to do? He was silent. The distant sound of bare footsteps could be heard in the silence. In the midst of nickel and plastic apparatuses, high cabinets with electronic apparatus, glasses, precision apparatuses, this sloppy, sloppy gait sounded like the clown&#39;s trick of someone insane. The stomping was getting closer. I stood up, watching Snaut with the greatest tension. He listened with narrowed eyes, but he didn&#39;t seem scared at all. So she wasn&#39;t afraid? - Where did it come from? I asked. And when he lingered, &quot;You don&#39;t want to tell me?&quot; - I do not know. - Okay. The footsteps receded and fell silent. - You do not believe me? - he said. - I give you my word that I don&#39;t know. Silently, I opened the suit closet and began to push apart their heavy, empty shells. As expected, there were gas guns on hooks at the back, used to move in a gravity-free vacuum. They weren&#39;t worth much, but they were weapons of some sort. I preferred one to none. I checked the pouch and slung the holster strap over my shoulder. Snaut watched me closely. As I adjusted the length of the thong, he showed his yellow teeth in a sneer. - Happy hunting! - he said. &quot;Thank you for everything,&quot; I replied, walking to the door. He sprang from his chair. - Kelvin! I looked at him. He wasn&#39;t smiling anymore. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen such a tired face. &quot;Kelvin, it&#39;s not... I... I really can&#39;t,&quot; he stammered. I waited to see if he would say anything else, but he just moved his lips as if to force something out. I turned and left without a word.
