At nineteen o'clock deck time I descended, passing those standing around the well, down the metal rungs to the inside of the bunker. There was just enough room in it to lift my elbows. When I screwed the end into the cable, protruding from the wall, the suit gave out and from then on I could no longer make the slightest movement. I was standing - or rather hanging - in an air-bed, fused together with a metal shell.
Raising my eyes, I saw through the convex glass of the well wall and Moddard's face bending above it. It disappeared immediately and darkness fell as a heavy protective cone was applied from above.
I heard the swish of electric motors tightening bolts eight times. Then - the hiss of air being let into the dampers. My eyesight was getting used to the darkness. I could already see the celadon outline of the only indicator.
- Ready, Kelvin? - sounded in the headphones.
- Ready, Moddard - I replied. - Don't worry about anything. The station will pick you up,' he said. - Have a good journey!
Before I had time to reply, something rasped upwards and the tray vibrated. I tensed my muscles reflexively, but nothing more happened.
- When do we take off? - I asked and heard a rustle, as if grains of the finest sand were falling on the membrane.
- You're flying now, Kelvin. Be well! - replied the close voice of Moddard. Before I could believe it, a wide gap opened in front of my face, through which I saw the stars. I tried in vain to find the alpha of Aquarius, towards which Prometheus had flown away. The skies of these sides of the Galaxy told me nothing, I did not know a single constellation, there was a sparkling dust in the narrow window. I waited to see when the first star would ripple. I didn't see it. They only began to fade and disappear, dissolving into the russet background. I realised I was already in the top layers of the atmosphere. Stiff, wrapped in pneumatic cushions, I could only look ahead. There was still no horizon. I flew and flew and flew, not feeling it at all, just slowly, insidiously, my body swamped with heat. Outside, a quiet, penetrating glow woke up as if of metal on wet glass. Had it not been for the digits, popping up in the pointer hole, I would not have realised the suddenness of the fall. The stars were gone.
The viewfinder was filled with an ore-like brightness. I could hear the heavy gait of my own pulse, my face was burning, I could feel the cold breeze of the air-conditioner on the back of my neck; I regretted not being able to y see Prometheus - he must have been out of sight by now - when the automatic device opened the viewfinder.
The feed hopper quivered once and a second time, vibrated unbearably, the tremor passed through all the insulating shells, through the air cushions and invaded deep into my body - the celadon outline of the indicator blurred. I looked at it without fear. I had not flown from so far away to die at my destination.
- Solaris Station," I said. - Solaris station, Solaris station! Do something. I seem to be losing stability. Station Solaris, this is the newcomer. Over.
And again I missed the important moment of the planet's appearance. It spread out huge, flat; I could tell from the size of the streaks on its surface that I was still far away. Or rather - high up, because I had already passed that intangible boundary where distance from a celestial body becomes height. I was falling. I was still falling. I felt it now, even closing my eyes. I opened them immediately because I wanted to see as much as possible. I waited a few tens of seconds of silence and renewed the calls. And this time I received no answer. The crackling of atmospheric discharges repeated in salvos in the headphones. Their background noise was as deep and low as if it were the voice of the planet itself. The orange sky in the viewfinder went white. Its glass darkened; I reflexively shrank back as far as the pneumatic bandages would allow before, the next second, I realised it was clouds. As if blown away, a shoal of them flew upwards. I glided on, once in the sun, once in the shade, the tray rotated along its vertical axis and a huge, as if swollen, solar disc steadily sailed in front of my face, appearing on the left and overlapping on the right. Suddenly, through the hum and crackle straight into my ear, a distant voice began to chatter:
- Solaris Station to newcomer, Solaris Station to newcomer. All right. Arrival under Station control. Solaris Station to newcomer, prepare to land at time zero, repeat, prepare to land at time zero, attention, commencing. Two hundred and fifty, two hundred and forty-nine, two hundred and forty-eight.... The individual words were punctuated by fractional meows, indicating that no human was speaking. It was strange, to say the least. Normally, whoever is alive runs to the airport when someone new arrives, and on top of that, straight from Earth. I couldn't ponder this any longer, however, because the huge circle the sun was making around me came to a standstill together with the plain towards which I was flying; this tilt was followed by another, in the opposite direction; I swayed like the weight of a giant pendulum and, fighting the dizziness, I saw on the rising wall-like sky of the planet, streaked with dirty lilac and blackish streaks, a tiny chessboard of white and green dots - the Station's orientation sign. At the same time, with a clatter, something detached itself from the top of the tray - the long necklace of the ring parachute, which rippled violently; there was something indescribably earthy about the sound - the first, after so many months, hum of real wind. Everything began to happen very quickly. Until then, all I knew was that I was falling. Now I saw it. The white-green chequered pattern was growing rapidly, and I could already see that it was painted on an elongated, whale-like, silvery-shiny body, with needles of radar sensors protruding from its sides, with rows of darker window openings, that this metallic colossus was not resting on the surface of the planet, but hanging above it, trailing its shadow across the ink-black background, an elliptical patch of darkness even deeper. At the same time I caught sight of the ocean's purple furrows, which revealed a faint movement, at once the clouds moved away high up, encompassed in a blinding scarlet at the edges, the sky between them stood distant and flat, buro-orange, and everything blurred: I fell into a corkscrew. Before I had time to speak, a brief thump returned the tray to its upright position, the mercurial light in the viewfinder lit up the wavy ocean to the smoky horizon; the growling ropes and rings of the parachute unhooked suddenly and flew over the waves, carried by the wind, and the tray swung softly, with that special, slow motion as usual in an artificial force field, and slipped down. The last thing I managed to see were the latticed aerial catapults and the two, rising probably several stories high, mirrors of the openwork radio telescopes. Something immobilised the tray with the shrill sound of steel striking spring against steel, something unbuckled beneath me and, with a protracted, wheezing sigh, the metal hulk in which I was stuck upright completed its hundred and eighty-kilometre journey.
- Solaris station. Zero and Zero. Landing complete. End - I heard the dead voice of the control device. With both hands (I felt an indistinct pressure on my chest and my insides became palpable as an unpleasant weight) I gripped the handles opposite my shoulders and disconnected the contacts. The green EARTH sign lit up and the tray wall opened; the pneumatic bed pushed me slightly in the back so that I had to, in order not to fall, take a step forward.
With a quiet hiss, similar to a resigned sigh, the air left the coils of the suit. I was free.
I stood beneath an aisle-high, silvery funnel. Bursts of coloured pipes descended the walls, disappearing into circular wells. I turned around. The ventilation shafts rumbled, drawing in the remnants of the poisonous planetary atmosphere that had invaded here during the landing. Empty as a cracked cocoon, the tray's cigar stood on a recessed steel canopy. Its outer plates were smoked a dirty brown. I climbed down a small ramp. Further down, a layer of rough plastic had been welded onto the metal. It had rubbed down to bare steel in places along which the usual trolley rocket lifters rolled. Suddenly the fan compressors went silent and there was complete silence. I looked around a little helplessly, expecting some person to appear, but still no one was coming. Only a neon arrow showed, blazing, a conveyor belt gliding silently by. I stepped onto its plane. The ceiling of the hall flowed down in a beautiful parabolic line, passing into the tube of the corridor. In its recesses rose piles of compressed gas cylinders, containers, ring parachutes, crates, all piled up in disarray, just the way they were. This also puzzled me. The conveyor ended at the circular extension of the corridor. Even more disorder reigned here. A puddle of oily liquid oozed under the pile of tin bubbles. An unpleasant, strong odour filled the air. In various directions were the footprints of shoes, clearly imprinted in this viscous liquid. Coils of white telegraph tapes, ragged papers and rubbish were crumbling between the tin, as if swept away from the cabins. And the green indicator glowed again, directing me towards the middle door. Behind them ran a corridor so narrow that two people would barely pass each other in it. Lighting was provided by the upper windows, pointed at the sky, with lenticular glass. Another door, painted in a white-green chequered pattern. It was ajar. I stepped inside. The half-spherical cabin had one large, panoramic window; the mist-laden sky blazed in it. Down below, blackened hills of waves moved noiselessly. The walls were full of open cupboards. They were filled with instruments, books, glasses with dried-up sediment, dusty thermoses. On the dirty floor stood five or six mechanical, rolling tables, between them a few armchairs, flabby because the air had been let out of them. Only one was bloated, with the backrest tilted back. In it sat a small, gaunt man with a sunburned face. His skin was flaking off his nose and cheekbones. I knew him. He was Snaut, Gibarian's deputy cyberneticist. In his time he had posted some not at all original articles in the solar almanac. I had never seen him before. He was wearing a mesh shirt, through the meshes of which a single grey hair of his flat chest poked out, and once white, knee-length, reagent-burned canvas trousers with numerous pockets like an assembler's. In his hand he held a plastic pear, the kind you drink from on ships without artificial gravity.
He looked at me as if struck by a blinding light. The pear fell out of his relaxed fingers and popped a few times like a balloon. A little transparent fluid spilled out of it. Slowly all the blood drained from his face. I was too surprised to speak, and the silent scene continued until his fear granted me in some incomprehensible way. I took a step.
He shrank back in his chair.
- Snaut... - I whispered. He twitched, as if struck. Staring at me with indescribable disgust, he whispered out:
- I don't know you, I don't know you, what do you want...?
The spilled liquid evaporated quickly. I smelled the scent of alcohol. Had he been drinking? Was he drunk? But why was he so afraid? I stood still in the middle of the cabin. My knees were soft and my ears felt like they were plugged with cotton wool. I took the pressure of the floor beneath my feet as something not yet entirely certain. Behind the curved glass of the window the ocean moved steadily. Snaut did not take his bloodshot eyes off me. The fear was receding from his face, but the unspeakable disgust was still there.
- What is wrong with you...? - I asked in a low voice. - Are you ill?
- You are caring... - he said deafeningly. - Aha. You're going to care, aren't you? But why about me?
I don't know you.
- Where is Gibarian? - I asked. For a second he lost his breath, his eyes became glassy again, something ignited in them and went out.
- Gi... giba... - he howled - no!!! no!!! He shook himself from a soundless, idiotic giggle, which was suddenly silenced.
- 'Have you come to Gibarian...? - he said almost calmly. - To Gibarian? What do you want to do with him?
He looked at me as if I had ceased at once to be a threat to him; there was something hatefully abusive in his words, and even more so in their tone.
- 'What are you saying...' - I burst out stunned. - Where is he? He was stunned.
- Don't you know...?
He's drunk, I thought. Drunk to the point of unconsciousness. I was becoming increasingly angry. I should have actually left, but my patience had run out.
- Wake up! - I roared. - How can I know where he is if I arrived just now!
What's the matter with you, Snaut!!!
His jaw dropped. He lost his breath again for a moment, but somehow differently, a sudden gleam appeared in his eyes. With shaking hands he grasped the armchair railing and stood up with difficulty until his joints shook.
- 'What,' he said almost soberly. - Have you flown in? Where did you come from?
- From Earth,' I replied furiously. - Have you heard of it? It looks like you haven't!
- From the ... big sky... are you - Kelvin?!
- Yes. What are you looking at like that for? What's so strange about it?
- 'Nothing,' he said, blinking his eyelids rapidly. - Nothing. He rubbed his forehead.
- 'Kelvin, sorry, it's nothing, you know, just a surprise. I wasn't expecting it.
- What do you mean you didn't expect it? After all, you got the message months ago, and Mod-dard telegraphed even today, from aboard the Pro-meteus....
- Yes. Yes... probably, only you see, there's a certain... ...disorder.
- Yes," I replied dryly. - It's hard not to see it.
Snaut walked around me, as if inspecting the appearance of my suit, -the most ordinary one in the world, with a harness of wires and cables on its chest. He coughed several times. He touched his bony nose. - Would you like to take a bath...? It'll do you good - the blue door, on the opposite - side.
- Thank you. I know the layout of the Station.
- Maybe you're hungry...?
- No. Where's Gibarian?
He came to the window, as if he hadn't heard my question. Turned by the cookers, he looked much older. His short-shorn hair was grey; his neck, sunburned, was marked by wrinkles as deep as cuts. Outside the window shone the great crests of the waves, rising and falling as slowly as if the ocean were solidifying. Looking out there, one had the impression that the Station was moving slightly sideways, as if slipping from an invisible base. Then it would return to equilibrium and go the same lazy tilt in the other direction. But this was probably an illusion. Patches of blood-coloured slimy foam gathered in the basins between the waves. For a blink I felt a faint pressure in my pits. The dry order of Prometheus' decks seemed to me something precious, irretrievably lost.
- Listen... - spoke up unexpectedly from Snaut - for the moment it was just me.... - He turned away. He rubbed his hands together nervously. - You'll have to be content with my company. For the time being. Call me Rat. You only know me from photographs, but that's nothing, that's what everyone says. I'm afraid there's no help for that. And when you have parents with cosmic aspirations like me, it's only when you're a Rat that you start to sound like one...
- Where is Gibarian? - I asked stubbornly again. He blinked.
- I'm sorry to take you on like that. It's... it's not just my fault. I completely forgot, there was a lot going on here, you know....
- Ah, that's all right - I replied. - Let's leave it at that. So what about Gibarian? He's not on the Station?
Has he gone somewhere?
- No - he replied. He looked at the corner cluttered with spools of cable. - He hasn't flown anywhere. And he won't fly. Because of this... among other things...
- What," I asked. My ears were still plugged and I seemed to hear worse. - What is the meaning of this? Where is he?
- After all, you already know - he said in a completely different tone. He looked into my eyes coldly, until shivers ran through me. He may have been drunk, but he knew what he was saying.
- Didn't it happen...?
- It happened.
- An accident?
He nodded his head. He not only nodded, he approved of my reaction at the same time. - When?
- Today at dawn.
Strangely enough, I felt no shock. Rather, the whole brief exchange of monosyllabic questions and answers reassured me with its matter-of-factness. I seemed to grasp already his previously incomprehensible behaviour.
- In what way?
- Change your clothes, put your things in order and come back here.... in... say, in an hour. I hesitated a moment.
- Good.
- Wait," he said as I turned towards the door. He was looking at me in a peculiar way.
I could see that what he wanted to say was not passing his lips.
- There were three of us and now, with you, there are three again. Do you know Sartorius?
- Like you, from a photograph.
- He's in the lab upstairs, and I don't suppose he'll be out of there before nightfall, but.... you'll recognise him in any case. If you saw someone else, you understand, not me or Sartorius, you understand, then....
- Then what?
I didn't know if I was dreaming. Against the backdrop of the black waves, shining bloodily in the low sun, he sat in an armchair with his head lowered as before and looked sideways at the spools of coiled
cable.
- This... don't do anything.
- Who can I see? A ghost! - I exploded.
- I understand. You think I'm crazy. No. I'm not crazy. I can't tell you otherwise.... for now. Anyway, maybe... nothing will happen. In any case, remember. I warned you.
- Warned about what? What are you talking about?
- Control yourself," he said stubbornly. - Act as if... be prepared for anything. It's impossible, I know. Nevertheless, try. It's the only advice. I don't know any other.
- But C O I will see!!! - I shouted almost. I barely restrained myself from snatching him by the shoulders and giving him a decent shake as he sat there like that, staring into the corner, with a tormented, sunburnt face, and with a visible effort, he forced out single words.
- I don't know. In a way it's up to you.
- Hallucinations?
- No. It's - it's real. Don't... attack. Remember.
- What are you saying! - I spoke in a not-your-voice.
- We are not on Earth.
- Polytheria? But they don't resemble humans at all! - I exclaimed. I didn't know what to do to shake him out of this stupor, from which he seemed to read a chilling senselessness.
- That's why it's so scary,' he said quietly. - Remember: be on your guard!
- What happened to Gibarian? He didn't answer.
- What is Sartorius doing?
- Come back in an hour.
I turned around and left. Opening the door, I looked at him again. He was sitting with his face in his hands, small, shrunken, in stained trousers. I noticed only now that there was baked blood on the knuckles of both hands.
