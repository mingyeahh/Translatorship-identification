In the middle of the night I was awakened by a light. I raised myself up on my elbow, shielding my eyes with my other hand.
Harey, wrapped in a sheet, was sitting at the foot of the bed, hunched over, her face streaked with hair. Her shoulders were twitching. She was crying without uttering a voice.
- Harey!
She scowled even more.
- What's the matter with you... Harey...
I sat up on the bed, not quite awake yet, extricating myself slowly from the nightmare that had been choking me a moment before. The girl was trembling. I put my arms around her. She pushed me away with her elbow. She was hiding her face.
- Honey.
- Don't say that.
- But, Harey, what's going on?
I saw her wet, tear-streaked face. Thick, childish tears were rolling down her cheeks, glistening in the pit above her chin, dripping onto the sheet.
- You don't want me.
- What's on your mind!
- I heard.
I felt my whole face stiffen.
- What did you hear? You didn't understand, it was just....
- No. No. You said it wasn't me. That I would go. I would have gone. God! I'd go, but I can't. I don't know what it is. I wanted to and I can't. I'm so, so wicked!
- Baby!!!
I grabbed her, pressed her to me with all my strength, everything was falling apart, I kissed her hands, wet and salty fingers, repeated some incantations, oaths, apologised, said it was a stupid, awful dream. Slowly she calmed down. She stopped crying. Her eyes were huge, lunatic.
They had gone dry. She turned . her head away.
- 'No,' she said, 'don't say that, you don't need to. You are not the same to me....
- I am not! It came out like a moan.
- Yes. You don't want me. I felt it over and over again. I pretended not to see. I thought maybe I was imagining it or something. But no. You're acting... different. You're not taking me seriously. It was a dream, it's true, but I was the one dreaming about you. You called me by my name. You were disgusted. Why! Why! I knelt down in front of her, put my arms around her knees.
- Child...
- I don't want you to talk like that. I don't want to, do you hear? I am no child. I am...
She burst out sobbing and fell face down on the bed. I stood up. Cool air was being drawn from the ventilation outlets with a quiet flurry. I was cold. I threw on my bathrobe, sat down on the bed and touched her shoulder.
- Harey, listen. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you the truth...
She sat up, leaning slowly on her hands. I could see the pulses throbbing under the thin skin of her neck. My face was numb again and I felt so cold, as if I were standing in the cold. There was a complete blank in my head.
- The truth? - she said. - A sacred word?
I didn't answer immediately, I had to overcome a throat cramp. It was such an old spell of ours. When it was said, neither of us dared to not only lie anymore, but even keep silent about anything. There was a time when we tormented ourselves with excessive honesty, in the naive belief that it would save us.
- A holy word - I said seriously. - Harey... She waited.
- You've changed too. We're all changing. But that's not what I wanted to say. It really looks like... that for a reason we both don't know exactly.... you can't leave me. But it's even a good thing, because I can't leave you either....
- Kris!
I lifted her up, wrapped in a sheet. The horn, damp with tears, rested on my shoulder.
I walked around the room and swung her. She stroked my face.
- No. You haven't changed. It's me - she whispered in my ear. - There's something about me. How about this? She stared at the black, empty rectangle left by the shattered door, the remains of which I had taken to the warehouse that evening. I'll have to hang a new one - I thought. I sat her down on the bed.
- Are you sleeping at all? - I asked standing over her with my arms down.
- I don't know.
- How do you not know. Think about it, darling.
- I don't think this is a real dream. Maybe I'm sick. I'm lying like this and thinking, and you know.... She trembled.
- 'What,' I asked in a whisper, my voice could have failed me.
- These are very strange thoughts. I don't know where they come from for me.
- For example?
I have to be calm, I thought, no matter what I hear, and I prepared myself for her words like a strong blow.
She shook her head helplessly.
- It's kind of ... all around...
- I don't understand...?
- As if it's not just in me, but further, somehow, I can't tell. There are no words for it...
- I'm sure it's a dream," I said casually and took a breath. - And now we'll turn off the light and we won't have any worries until the morning, and in the morning, if we feel like it, we'll try to get new ones. Okay?
She reached out for the switch, darkness fell, I lay back on the cooled bedding and felt the warmth of her approaching breath.
I embraced her.
- Tighter,' she whispered. And after a long moment: - Kris!
- What?
- I love you. I felt like screaming.
The morning was red. The puffy sun disc stood low over the horizon. A letter lay at the doorstep. I tore open the envelope. Ha-rey was in the bathroom, I could hear her humming. From time to time she looked out from there, doused in wet hair. I went to the window and read:
"Kelvin, we are bogged down. Sartorius is in favour of a vigorous course of action. He believes he will be able to destabilise neutrino systems. He needs a certain amount of plasma for his experiments, as the initial building block of F. He proposes that you go on reconnaissance and retrieve a certain amount of plasma for the tray. Act on your own discretion, but let me know your decision. I have no opinion. I don't seem to have anything left at all. I'd prefer it if you did just because we're going to move forward, however seemingly. Otherwise all that is left is to envy G.
Rat
PS. Don't get on the radio station. That you can still do for me. The best thing you can do is make a phone call." My heart squeezed as I read this letter. I looked through it carefully again, tore it up and threw the shreds into the sink. Then I started looking for a suit for Harey. Already it was awful. Just like the previous time. But she didn't know anything, otherwise she couldn't have been so happy when I told her I had to go for a little reconnaissance outside the Station and ask her to accompany me. We had breakfast in the small kitchen (with Harey again barely swallowing a few bites) and went to the library.
I wanted to review the literature on field problems and neutrino systems before doing what Sartorius wanted. I didn't yet know how I would go about it, but I decided to control his work. It occurred to me that some kind of neutrino annihilator that didn't yet exist could trigger Snaut and Sartorius, and I would wait out the 'operation' along with Harey somewhere outside - in an aeroplane, for example. I would dawdle for some time at a large electronic catalogue, asking him a question, to which he would either reply by throwing out a fiche with the laconic words 'None in the Bibliography', or he would suggest I venture into such a jungle of specialised, physicalist papers that I didn't know what to make of it. Somehow, I didn't want to leave this large, circular room with its smooth walls, swathed in drawers with a myriad of microfilms and electron records. Located in the heart of the Station, the library had no windows and was the best insulated place inside the steel shell. Who knows if that wasn't why I was comfortable in it, despite the apparent failure of my search. I wandered around the great hall until I was confronted with a huge, ceiling-length bookcase full of books. This was not so much a luxury, which was dubious to say the least, as an expression of remembrance and respect for the pioneers of Solarian exploration: the shelves, numbering some six hundred volumes, carried the entire classics of the subject, starting with Giese's monumental, if largely outdated, nine-volume monograph. I took out these volumes, from the weight of which my hand immediately sagged, and leafed through them absentmindedly, perched on the armchair railing. Harey, too, had found herself some book - over her shoulder I read a few lines of print. It was one of the few books belonging to the first expedition, perhaps even once owned by Giese himself - "The Interplanetary Cook"... I said nothing, seeing with what attention Harey was studying the recipes, adapted to the harsh conditions of cosmonautics, and returned to the respectable book I had in my lap. 'Ten years of Solaris research' came out in the 'Solariana' series as items four to thirteen, while the present ones have four-digit numbers.
Giese did not have much flair, but this trait can only hurt a Solaris researcher. Nowhere perhaps does imagination and the ability to hastily create hypotheses become so fatal. After all, anything is possible on this planet. The unbelievable-sounding descriptions of the constellations formed by the plasma are in all probability authentic, although generally unverifiable, for the ocean rarely repeats its evolutions. To the first-time observer, they are frightening mainly because of their strangeness and enormity; if they occurred on a small scale, in a byre, they would probably be considered just another "freak of nature", a manifestation of randomness and blind play of forces. The fact that mediocrity and genius are equally helpless in the face of the infinite variety of solar forms does not make it any easier to deal with the phenomena of the living ocean either. Giese was neither one nor the other. He was simply a classifier-pedant, of the kind whose outward calmness shields the life-consuming, tireless fervour of his work. For as long as he could, he simply used the language of description, and when he ran out of words, he coped by creating new words, often unfortunate ones, incompatible with the phenomena he was describing. But in the end, no terms can capture what is happening on Solaris. His "montane trees", his "longwoods", his "mushrooms", his "mimoids", his "sime-triads" and "asymmetriads", his "trowels" and his "khyz" sound insanely artificial, but they give some idea of Solaris even to those who have seen nothing but blurry photographs and supremely imperfect films. Of course, this conscientious classifier has also sinned by more than one carelessness. Man always makes hypotheses, even when he is on guard, even when he does not know it. Giese thought that the "longons" were a fundamental form, and juxtaposed it with the many times enlarged and piled up tidal waves of the earth's seas. Anyone who has dug around in the first edition of his work, by the way, knows that he originally just called them 'tides', inspired by a geocentrism that would be laughable if it were not for its helplessness. After all, these are - if we are already looking for comparisons on Earth - formations, in size exceeding the Grand Canyon of Colorado, modelled in a material that has a jelly-water-foam consistency on the surface (with this foam solidifying into giant, easily crumbling festoons, into lace with giant eyes, and even appeared to some researchers as "skeleton-watt-like growths") - while at depth it changes into an increasingly firm substance, like a taut muscle, but a muscle which soon exceeds the hardness of a boulder at a depth of several metres, while still retaining elasticity. Between the walls, taut as a membrane on a monster's back, to which the "skeletons" cling, stretches the "longon" itself over the course of kilometres, a seemingly autonomous creature, like some colossal python that has devoured whole mountains and now digests them in silence, from time to time setting its fish-like compressed body into slow, twitching movements. But this is what the "longon" looks like only from above, from the deck of a flying machine. When one approaches it, until the two "gorge walls" rise hundreds of metres above the aircraft, the "python's trunk" turns out to be an area of movement stretching to the horizon, so dizzying that it takes on the appearance of a passively swollen cylinder. The first impression is that of a swirling, slippery, greyish-green slurry, which piles up to reject the strong flashes of the sun, but when the machine hovers just above the surface (and the edges of the 'gorge', concealing the 'longon', then become as if peaks on either side of a geological sinkhole), it becomes apparent that the movement is far more complicated. It has concentric circulations, darker streams intersect in it, at times the top 'mantle' becomes a mirror-like surface reflecting the sky and clouds, pierced with a roar of gunfire by eruptions of gas-mixed, semi-liquid medium. It slowly becomes clear that just below you is the centre of action of the forces that keep the sloping slopes of the sluggishly crystallising jelly spread out against the sky, but what is obvious to the eye is not so easily acknowledged by science. For how many years there have been fierce debates about what actually happens within the 'longons' that plough the immensity of the living ocean by the millions. It was thought that these were some kind of monster organs, that metabolism, respiratory processes, nutrient transport, and only dusty libraries know what else took place within them. Each hypothesis was eventually disproved by a thousand painstaking and sometimes dangerous experiments. And all this applies only to 'longons', essentially the simplest, most durable form, as their existence is counted for weeks - a thing quite unique here.
A more intricate, capricious and perhaps the most violently objectionable form - objectionable, of course, reflexively - are the "mimoids". It is no exaggeration to say that Giese loved them and devoted himself to researching, describing and guessing at their essence. He used the name to express what is most peculiar to human beings in them: a certain tendency to imitate the forms around them, be they close or distant.
One day, deep beneath the surface of the ocean, a flat, wide circle with jagged edges and a tarry surface begins to darken. After a dozen hours or so, it becomes flaky, showing more and more clearly its dismemberment, and at the same time it breaks through upwards, towards the surface. An observer would swear that a fierce battle is taking place beneath it, as from all around it, like shrinking lips, like living, muscular, closing craters, endless rows of concurrent, circular waves, pile up over the blackish, wobbly maya, spilling into the depths, and, standing toe-to-toe, crash downwards. Each such collapse of hundreds of thousands of tons is accompanied for seconds by a stretched, viscous, gurgling, one would like to say, thunder, because here everything is happening on a monstrous scale. The dark formation is pushed down, each successive blow seems to flatten and split it, from the individual lobes, which hang like soggy wings, separate into long clusters, narrow into long necklaces, melt into each other and flow upwards, carrying the mother shield, as if clinging to them, fossilised, and meanwhile, from above, successive rings of waves continually fall into the ever more visibly concave collar. And this game goes on, sometimes for a day, sometimes for a month. Sometimes it all ends there. The conscientious Giese called this variant the "abortive mimoid", as if, out of the blue, he possessed the precise knowledge that the ultimate goal of any such cataclysm is the "mature mimoid", i.e. that colony of polypoid, I-skinned growths (usually larger than an earthly city) whose destiny is to ape external shapes.... Of course, there was no shortage of another solar scientist, named Uyvens, who regarded this final phase precisely as 'degenerative', as degeneration, death, and the forest of shapes being created as an obvious manifestation of the liberation of the de-polyped creations from the authority of the matrix.
Giese, however, who in all his descriptions of other solar formations behaves like an ant walking over a frozen waterfall, not allowing anything to interrupt the steady pace of his dry phrase, was so sure of himself that he arranged the individual phases of the mimoid's emergence into a sequence of increasing perfection.
Seen from on high, the mimoid appears to resemble a city, but this is a delusion induced by the search for any analogy in the midst of the familiar. When the sky is clear, all the multi-storey outgrowths and their pinnacle palisades are surrounded by a layer of heated air, causing the apparent swaying and bending of shapes already difficult to determine. The first cloud gliding blue (I say that out of habit, as this 'blue' is red for red, and frighteningly white during a blustery day) elicits an immediate response. It begins a violent budding, upward is thrown an almost completely separated from the ground, a malleable, puffy cauliflower-like shell that simultaneously fades and, after a few minutes, deceptively imitates a billowing cloud. This giant object casts a reddish shadow, one mimic peaks give as if to the next; this movement is always in the opposite direction to that of the actual cloud. I think Giese would probably give his hand to find out at least why this happens. But such 'solitary' creations of the mimic are nothing compared to the spontaneous activity it manifests when 'irritated' by the presence of objects and shapes that appear above it through earthly visitors. The reproduction of forms extends, indeed, to anything within eight to nine miles. Most often, the mimoid produces an enlarged reproduction, sometimes distorting it to create caricatures or grotesque simplifications, especially of machines. Obviously, the material is always the same, quickly fading mass, which, when thrown into the air, instead of falling down, hovers, connected by easily torn umbilical cords to the ground, over which it glides crawling, while at the same time shrinking, narrowing or inflating, smoothly forming itself into the most intricate patterns. An aeroplane, a truss or a mast are reproduced with the same vividness; mimoid does not react to humans alone or, strictly speaking, to any living creatures, including plants, because these too were brought to Solaris for experimental purposes by tireless researchers. On the other hand, a mannequin, a human puppet, a statue of a dog or a tree sculpted from any material is copied immediately.
And here, unfortunately, it should be noted parenthetically that this 'obedience' of the mimoid to the experimenters, so unique on Solaris, is sometimes subject to suspension. The most mature mimoid experiences its "lazy days", during which it only pulsates very slowly. This pulsation, moreover, is not discernible to the eye; its rhythm, a single phase of its 'pulse', spans more than two hours, and it only took special film footage for it to be discovered. Under such circumstances, the mimoid, especially the old one, is perfect for exploring, as both the supporting shield, submerged in the ocean, and the formations erected from it give all too sure footing.
Of course, it is also possible to visit the mimosíd during its "busy" days, but then visibility is close to zero, due to the constant dropping of the fluffy, whitish colloidal suspension, which continually falls from the swollen abdomen, copying the forms. These forms are, moreover, impossible to grasp at close range, due to their vastness on a mountainous scale. In addition, the substrate of the "working" mimic becomes soggy from the fleshy rain, which only turns into a hard shell, many times lighter than pumice stone, after several hours.
Finally, without the appropriate equipment, it is easy to get lost in the labyrinth of bulging shells, resembling neither shrinking columns nor semi-liquid geysers, even in bright sunlight, as its rays cannot pierce the cover of the "imitation explosions" continually thrown into the atmosphere.
Observing the mimic in its happy days (these are, to be more precise, the happy days of the researcher above it) can be a source of indelible impressions. It has its 'creative highs' when it embarks on an incredible hyperproduction. He then creates either his own variants of external forms, or their complications or even "formal continuations", and can entertain himself in this way for hours, to the delight of the abstract painter and the despair of the scientist who tries in vain to understand anything of the processes taking place. At times, the mimoid's activity manifests the characteristics of a downright childish simplification, at other times it descends into a "baroque deviation", in which case everything it creates is marked by the stigma of a swollen elephant's flesh. The old mimoids, in particular, fabricate shapes capable of provoking hearty laughter. Admittedly, I have never been able to laugh at them, too shocked by the mysteriousness of the spectacle.
It goes without saying that in the first years of research, the mimoids were cast as the supposed dream centres of the Solarian ocean, as places where the longed-for contact between two civilisations would take place. All too soon, however, it became apparent that there was no contact at all, as everything began and ended with the imitation of shapes, which led nowhere. The anthropo- or zoomorphism, which was constantly recurring in the desperate search of researchers, saw in other and other products of the living ocean "sensory organs" or even "limbs", for which scholars (such as Maartens and Ekkonai) for a time took Giese's "trowels" and "chyazas". But these protuberances of living ocene shooting sometimes up to two miles into the atmosphere are as much 'limbs' as an earthquake is the 'gymnastics' of its crust.
The catalogue of relatively constant recurring forms, birthed by the living ocean so frequently that at least a few dozen or a few hundred may be discovered on its surface in a day, includes some three hundred items. The most inhuman, in the sense of having absolutely no resemblance to anything experienced by man on Earth, are, according to the Giese school, the symmetries. When it was already well known that the ocean does not behave aggressively and that one can only perish in its plasmatic depths if one takes special care to do so due to one's own carelessness or thoughtlessness (I am not, of course, talking about accidents caused, for example, by damage to the oxygen apparatus or air-conditioning unit), then it became clear that the ocean is not the only place in the world where the ocean is a threat. I am of course not talking about accidents caused by e.g. damage to the oxygen apparatus or the air-conditioning unit), that even cylindrical rivers of debt and monstrous columns of tetrapods, wobbling erroneously among the clouds, can be pierced through by aircraft or other flying machines without the slightest danger; the plasma gives a free path, parting before the alien body with a rapidity equal to the speed of sound in the Solarian atmosphere, opening, if forced to do so, deep tunnels even under the surface of the ocean (while the energy, which it instantly sets in motion for this purpose, is enormous - Scriabin calculated it at 1019 ergs in extreme cases!!!). The study of symmetriads was approached with extreme caution with the constant retreating, multiplying safeguards, often admittedly fictitious, and the names of those who first ventured into their abysses are known to every child on Earth.
The horror of these giants does not lie in their appearance, although it can indeed give one nightmarish dreams. Rather, it comes from the fact that there is nothing constant or certain about them; even physical laws are suspended within them. It is the researchers of symmetries who have always most loudly repeated the thesis that the living ocean is rational.
Symmetrics arise suddenly. Their birth is a kind of eruption. About an hour beforehand, the ocean begins to shimmer violently, as if glazed over an area of tens of square kilometres. Beyond that, its fluidity or the rhythm of its undulations does not change. Occasionally, a symmetry erupts where there was a funnel from the sucked-up chiseled, but this is not the rule. After an hour or so, the glazing shell flies upwards in a monstrous bubble in which the entire sky, the sun, the clouds, all the spectrums are reflected, shimmering and refracting. The lightning-like play of colours, caused partly by deflection and partly by refraction, is unparalleled.
Particularly violent light effects are produced by symmetries arising during a blue day and just before sunset. One then has the impression that a planet is giving birth to another, doubling in volume with every passing moment. The blazing globe, barely launched from the depths, splits into vertical sectors at the top, but this is not a break-up. This stage, referred to unhappily as the 'flower cup phase', lasts for seconds. Measuring into the sky, the arcs of membranous spans turn around, fuse in an invisible interior and begin to form, in an instant, something like a curvaceous torso, within which hundreds of phenomena take place
hundreds of phenomena at once. At the very centre, explored for the first time by Hamalei's seventy-strong team, the formation of an axial lifting arbor, sometimes called a 'spine', occurs by gi-ganto- and polycrystallisation, but I am not a fan of this term. The breakneck architectonics of this central support is supported in statu
nascendi by gushing incessantly from kilometre-long sinkholes vertical columns of such diluted, almost watery jelly. During this process, the colossus emits a deafening, prolonged roar, and is surrounded by a shaft of rapidly fluttering, snowy, thick-bellied foam. This is followed, from the centre to the periphery, by extremely complex rotations of thickened planes, on which layers of stretchy material, beating from the depths, are built up, at the same time the geysers of the depths just mentioned are transformed, with a thickening, moving tentacle-like columns, their bursts heading towards the construction's strictly defined dynamics, resembling some sort of sky-scraping fetus growing with a thousand-fold acceleration, through which streams of pink blood and water so dark green that it's almost black flow. From this moment on, the symmetry already begins to manifest its most extraordinary property - that of modelling or even suspending certain physical laws. Let us first say that no two symmetriads are the same and the geometry of each is, as it were, a new 'invention' of the living ocean. Further, the symmetry produces in its interior what are often called 'momentary machines', although these creations do not resemble human-constructed machines at all, it is only a matter of a relatively narrow and thus as if 'mechanical' purposefulness of action.
When the geysers bursting from the abyss bind or expand into thick-walled galleries and corridors running in all directions, and the "membranes" form a system of intersecting planes, overhangs and ceilings, the symmetry justifies its name by the fact that for every shape of winding passages, passages and inclines in one pole there corresponds in detail to the layout at the opposite pole.
After some twenty to thirty minutes, the giant begins to sink slowly, sometimes having first inclined eight to twelve degrees in its vertical axis. There are larger and smaller symmetries, but even dwarfs rise after a dip to a good eight hundred metres above the horizon and are visible from a distance of several miles. The safest way to get inside is just after equilibrium has occurred, when the whole thing stops plunging into the living ocean, at the same time returning to the exact vertical; the most appropriate place to penetrate is just below the top. There, the relatively smooth polar "cap" is surrounded by an area punctured like a lump by the dull mouths of the inner chambers and ducts. This formation is - as a whole - a three-dimensional development of some higher-order equation.
As we know, any equation can be expressed in the figurative language of higher geometry and a solid equivalent can be constructed. The symmetry is - in this sense - some kind of relative of Lobaczewski's cones and Riemann's negative curves, but a very distant relative, due to its unimaginable complexity. It is a development of the whole mathematical system, covering several cubic miles, and this development is four-dimensional, because the essential coefficients of the equations are also expressed in time, in changes occurring with its passage.
The simplest idea was, of course, that we have before us nothing more or less than a
a "mathematical machine" of the living ocean, a model created on its scale of calculations, needed by it for a purpose unknown to us, but this hypothesis of Fermont's is no longer shared by anyone today. Tempting it certainly was - but the notion that with such titanic eruptions, every particle of which is subjected to the endlessly complicating formulas of great analysis, the living ocean pondered questions of matter, of space, of being ... could not be sustained. Too many phenomena can be encountered in the depths of the giant that are incompatible with this essentially simple (childishly naïve, as some want to say) picture.
There was no shortage of attempts to devise an accessible model of symmetry, to visualise it; the example of Awe-rian, who put it this way, became quite popular: Let us imagine an ancient building from the times of Babylonian splendour, let it be formed of a living, excitable and evolving substance; its architecture passes smoothly through a series of transitional phases, assuming before our eyes the forms of Greek and Romanesque construction, then the columns begin to slenderise like stalks, the vaulting loses its weight, becomes more elusive, sharpens, the arches pass into steep parabolas, and finally they collapse in a shooting pattern. The Gothic thus created begins to mature and age, it flows into late forms, the hitherto austerity of steep ascent is replaced by eruptions of orgiastic exuberance, the Baroque grows in front of our eyes, bearing the fruit of excess; if we continue this sequence, treating our ever-changing creation as individual stages of a living existence, we will finally reach the architecture of the cosmodromic age, coming closer at the same time, perhaps, to an understanding of what a symmetry is.
But this comparison, however developed and enriched (indeed, there have been attempts to visualise it by means of special models and film), remains at best impotent, at worst an evasion, if not simply a lie, for the symmetry bears no resemblance to anything earthly....
Man can grasp so few things at once; we see only what is happening in front of us, here and now; to visualise the simultaneous multiplicity of processes, however related, however complementary, is beyond his capacity. We experience this
even in the face of relatively simple phenomena. The fate of one man may mean a lot, the fate of several hundred is difficult to grasp, but the history of a thousand or a million means essentially nothing. The symmetry is a million, no, a billion raised to a power, an unimaginability itself; So what if, in the depths of an aisle that is a tenth of the Kronecker space, we stand like ants attached to the folds of a breathing vault, and we see the rise of gigantic planes, opalescent grey in the light of our flares, their interpenetration, softness and infallible perfection of a solution, which is, after all, only a moment - because here everything flows - the content of this architecture is movement, concentrated and purposeful. We are observing a crumb of a process, the vibration of a single string in a symphonic orchestra of super giants, and little because we know - but only know, without comprehending - that simultaneously above and below us, in the soaring abysses, beyond the limits of sight and imagination, multitudes and millions of simultaneous transformations are taking place, linked to each other like notes by mathematical counterpoint. So someone called it a geometrical symphony, but in the face of this we are deaf listeners to it.
Here, in order to see anything really, one would have to move away, to retreat into some vast distance, but after all, everything in the symmetry-da is interior, multiplying, bursting with avalanches of birth, endlessly shaping, while shaping is at the same time shaping, and no mimosa is as sensitive to touch as the part of the symmetry-da that is miles away from where we stand, separated by a hundred storeys, to the changes that this our place is experiencing. Here each momentary construction, with a beauty that finds fulfilment beyond the limits of sight, is co-constructor and conductor of all the others, sharing, and they in turn modelling influence. A symphony - fine, but one that creates itself and chokes itself. Terrible is the end of symmetry. No one who saw it could resist the impression that they were witnessing a tragedy, if not a murder. After some two or three hours at the most - this explosive proliferation, duplication and self-command never lasts longer - the living ocean proceeds to attack. This is what it looks like: the smooth surface wrinkles, the already calmed, foam-dry shore begins to boil, concentric waves rush from the horizon, the same muscular craters as those assisting the birth of the mimic, but this time their size is incomparably greater. The undersea part of the symmetry is compressed, the colossus rises slowly upwards, as if it were about to be thrown beyond the planet's perimeter; the surface layers of oceanic soil begin to activate, crawling higher and higher, onto the sidewalls, coating them, constricting them, bricking up the outlets, but all this is nothing compared to what is taking place simultaneously in the depths. First
form-forming processes - the emergence of successive architectures from one another - freeze for a brief moment, then they accelerate rapidly, the movements hitherto, smooth penetrations, folds, the flailing of warps and vaults, hitherto steady and as sure as if they were to last for centuries, begin to rage. The feeling that the colossus, in the face of imminent danger, begins to strive rapidly towards some kind of fulfilment, becomes overwhelming. However, the more the speed of transformation increases, the more overt the awful, repulsive metamorphosis of the building itself and its dynamics becomes. All the shoots of wonderfully supple planes soften, flabby, sagging, stumbling, unfinished forms begin to appear, mangled, crippled, from the invisible depths there is a growing hum, a roar, the air, thrown out as if in some agonising breath, rubbing against the narrowing straits, snoring and playing thunderously in its flights, stimulates the collapsing ceilings to growl as if it were some monstrous larynxes, overgrown with stalactites of mucus, dead vocal cords, and the viewer is momentarily overwhelmed, despite the unleashing of the most violent movement - it is, after all, a movement of destruction - a complete deadness. Only an orcano howling from the abyss, traversing it in thousands of shafts, supports, blowing, the sky-building, which begins to flow downwards, collapsing, like a patch caught in the flames, but the last flutters are still visible here and there, inert, detached from the rest of the movement, blind, weaker and weaker, until, attacked relentlessly, from outside, the washed-out immensity collapses with the slowness of a mountain and disappears in a profusion of foam, the same as that which accompanied its titanic rise. 
And what does it all mean? Yes, what does it mean...
I remember a school trip touring the Solarian Institute in Aden when I was Gibarian's assistant, and after passing through a side room of the library, the youngsters were led into the main room, the lion's share of which is filled with microfilm cassettes. On them are captured tiny fractions of the interior of symmetries, obviously long gone, and there are there, not photographs but whole reels, over ninety thousand of them. And then a fat girl, maybe fifteen years old, wearing glasses, with a resolute and understanding look, suddenly asked a question: - What's all this for...? And in the awkward silence that then ensued, only the teacher looked sternly at her unruly pupil; of the guided solarists (I was among them), no one came up with an answer. Because symmetries are unique and the phenomena occurring in them are generally unique. Sometimes the air stops conducting sound in them. Sometimes the refractive index increases or decreases. Locally there are pulsating, rhythmic changes in gravity, as if the symmetria-da had a beating, gravitational heart.
At times the researchers' gyrocompasses begin to behave as if deranged, layers of increased ionisation arise and disappear, a calculation that could be continued. Anyway, if ever the mystery of symmetries is solved, asymmetries remain....
They arise in a similar way, only they have a different end and nothing can be seen in them but vibration, bludgeoning, flickering; we know only that they harbour dizzying processes, at the limits of physically possible speeds, they are also called "exaggerated quantum phenomena". Their mathematical resemblance to certain models of the atom, however, is so unstable and ephemeral that some regard them as an incidental or even accidental feature. They live an incomparably shorter life than those, only a dozen minutes or so, and the end is perhaps even more awful, because in the wake of the hurricane, which fills and bursts them with hard, roaring air, a liquid rises in them with infernal viciousness, boiling under a blanket of filthy foam, and drowns everything, bubbling, hideous, followed by an explosion like the eruption of a mud volcano, throwing up a tarnished column of debris, whose macerated rain falls long afterwards on the restless surface of the ocean. Some, wind-blown, shrivelled, yellowish, flat and thus resembling membranous bones or cartilage of some kind, can be found drifting on the waves many tens of kilometres beyond the focus of the explosion.
A separate group is made up of formations that separate completely from the living ocean for a shorter or longer period of time, which are far rarer and more difficult to observe than those. Their remains, first found, were identified most falsely, as it turned out much later, as the carcasses of creatures living in the depths of the ocean. At times they seem to flee like strange, many-winged birds from the trumpets of the chyz, chasing them, but this notion, taken from Earth, once again becomes a wall. which cannot be broken through. Occasionally, but very rarely, on the rocky shores of the islands, one can see the odd flightless seal-like shoals, as they rest in the sun or lazily crawl into the sea to melt into one with it.
And so they kept turning in a circle of earthly, human notions, and first contact.... Expeditions traversed hundreds of kilometres in the depths of the symmetriads, set up recording cameras, self-made film cameras; the televised eyes of artificial satellites recorded the budding of mimoids and longons, their maturation and death. Libraries were filling up, archives were growing, the price to pay for this, at times, was becoming high. Seven hundred and eighteen people died in cataclysms, having failed to withdraw in time from already doomed colossi, one hundred and six of them in a single catastrophe, famous because it also claimed the life of Giese himself, then an old man of seventy, when the end, usually inherent in asymmetries, unexpectedly befell a creature that was clearly an embodied symmetry. Seventy-nine people, together with their machines and apparatuses, clad in armoured suits, were swallowed up within seconds by an explosion of muddy slush, drawing down with their explosions a further twenty-seven who were piloting the planes and helicopters circling above the creature under examination. The site, at the junction of the forty-second parallel with the eighty-ninth meridian, is marked on maps as the One Hundred Sixth eruption. But this point exists only on maps, for the surface of the ocean there is no different from all its other areas. At that time, for the first time in the history of solar research, voices were raised calling for the use of thermonuclear strokes. This was in fact to be crueler than revenge: it was to destroy that which we cannot comprehend. Tsanken, the deputy of Giese's reserve group, who only survived due to a mistake - the relay machine had falsely marked the place where those there were studying symmetry, so that Tsanken wandered in his machine over the ocean and arrived literally minutes after the explosion, flying, he could still see its black mushroom - as the decision weighed in, he threatened to blow up the Station with himself and the eighteen others in it, and although it was never officially admitted that this suicidal ultimatum influenced the outcome of the vote, it can be assumed that it did. 
But the days when such populous expeditions haunted the planet are in the past. The Station itself - its construction was overseen from satellites, an engineering endeavour on a scale of which Earth might have been proud had it not been for the fact that the ocean emerged a million times larger in seconds - was formed in the form of a disc two hundred metres in diameter, with four storeys in the centre and two on the periphery. Suspended five hundred to one thousand five hundred metres above the ocean, thanks to gravitators driven by the energy of ani-hilation, it was equipped, in addition to all the devices possessed by ordinary Stations and the great Satelloids of other planets, with special radar sensors, ready to activate additional power at the first change in the oceanic slope, so that the steel disk floats off into the stratosphere when the first harbingers of the birth of a new life-form appear.
Now the Station was virtually deserted. Since the automatons had been locked - for reasons I still don't know - in the bottom storerooms, it was possible to roam the corridors without encountering anyone as if in a blindly drifting wreck whose machines had survived the annihilation of the crew.
As I put the ninth volume of Giese's monograph on the shelf, it seemed to me that the steel, hidden under a layer of fluffy foam-plastic, trembled under my feet. I became immobile, but the trembling did not recur. The library was perfectly insulated from the rest of the body, the tremor could only have one cause. Some kind of rocket had taken off from the Station. This thought brought me back to reality. I was still not quite decided whether I would fly, as Sartorius had wished.
By acting as if I fully accepted his plans, I could at most postpone the crisis; I was almost certain there would be a clash, as I resolved to do what I could to save Harey. The whole point was whether Sartorius was likely to succeed. His advantage over me was immense - as a physicist, he knew the problem ten times better than I did and I could only, paradoxically, count on the perfection of the solutions the ocean was glaring at us with. Over the next hour, I hunched over the microfilms, trying to pick out anything intelligible from the sea of infernal mathematics whose language was spoken by the physics of neutrino processes. At first it seemed hopeless, especially as there were five incredibly difficult theories of the neutrino field, a clear sign that none was perfect. And yet I finally managed to find something promising. I was just writing down the formulas for myself when a knock-no sounded.
I walked quickly to the door and opened it, blocking the gap with my own body. Snaut's face, shining with sweat, appeared in it. The corridor behind him was empty.
- 'Oh, it's you,' I said, swinging the door open. - Come in.
- Yes, it's me - he replied. His voice was hoarse, bags under his reddened eyes, he was wearing a shiny rubber radiation apron with elastic braces, the soiled legs of the same trousers he always walked in protruded from under the apron. His eyes swept around the circular, evenly lit room and became transfixed when he spotted Harey standing in the depths next to the chair. We exchanged glancing glances, I closed my eyelids, then he bowed slightly and, falling into a companionable tone, I said:
- This is Dr Snaut, Harey - Snaut, this is .... my wife.
- I am... a very low-visibility member of the crew and therefore .... - the pause lengthened dangerously - I haven't had the opportunity to meet.... - Harey smiled and shook his hand, which he shook, it seemed to me, with some stupor, blinked his eyelids a few times and stood looking at her until I took him by the arm.
- 'I'm sorry,' he said to her then. - 'I wanted to speak to you, Kelvin...
- 'Of course,' I replied with some big-world casualness; it all sounded like cheesy comedy to me, but there was no advice. - 'Harey, darling, don't bother. We need to talk to the doctor about our boring stuff....
And I was already leading him by the elbow towards the small armchairs on the opposite side of the room. Harey sat down in the armchair I had previously sat in, but she pushed it in the process in such a way that, lifting her head from above the book, she could see us.
- What's up? - I asked quietly.
- 'I got divorced,' he replied in the same, only more wheezing whisper. It is possible that I would have laughed if I had ever been told this story and such a conversation starter, but at the Station my sense of humour was amputated. - 'I've lived a few years since yesterday, Kelvin,' he added.
- 'A couple of good years. How about you?
- Nothing... - I replied after a while because I didn't know what to say. I liked him, but I felt that I had to be on my guard against him now, or rather against what he had come to me with. - Nothing? - He repeated in the same tone as me. - Please, is that so...?
- What do you mean? - I pretended not to understand. He squinted his bloodshot eyes and, leaning over so that I could feel the warmth of his breath on my face, whispered:
- We're getting bogged down, Kelvin. I can't connect with Sartorius anymore, I know as much as I wrote to you, what he told me after that little darling conference of ours....
- Has he turned off the visophone? - I asked.
- No. There's a short circuit in there with him. He seems to have done it deliberately or.... - he made a movement with his fist as if he was breaking something. I looked at him without saying a word. The left corner of his mouth lifted in an unpleasant smile.
- 'Kelvin, I came because...' He didn't finish.
- What are you going to do?
- You mean this letter...? - I replied slowly. - I can do it, I don't see any reason to refuse, that's why I'm sitting here, I wanted to find out....
- No - he interrupted. - Not about that...
- No...? - I said pretending to be surprised. - So I'm listening.
- Sartorius - he muttered after a while. - He seems to have found his way.... you know.
He didn't take his eyes off me. I sat still, trying to put on an indifferent expression. - First there's the X-ray story. What Gibarian did with it, you remember. Some modification is possible...
- What kind of modification?
- They just sent a beam of radiation into the ocean and just modulated its intensity according to various patterns.
- Yes, I know about that. Nilin has done it before. And a whole bunch of others.
- Yes, but they used soft radiation. This was hard, they were packing everything they had into the ocean, all the power.
- This could have unpleasant consequences, I noted. - Violation of the convention of the four and the UN.
- Kelvin... don't pretend. After all, it doesn't matter now. Gibarian is dead.
- Oh, Sartorius wants to blame everything on him?
- I don't know. I haven't spoken to him about it. It doesn't matter. Sartorius thinks that since the 'visitor' only ever appears when you're awake, he apparently pulls the production recipe out of us while we're asleep. He thinks that our most important state - is sleep. That's why he acts that way. So Sartorius. wants to send him our waking - waking thoughts - do you understand?
- In what way? By mail?
- You will frame the jokes separately. This burst of rays will be modulated by the brain currents of either of us.
At once my head brightened.
- Aha - I said. - That someone is me. What?
- Yes. He was thinking of you.
- Thanks a lot.
- What do you think of that?
I remained silent. Saying nothing he looked slowly at Harey sunk in reading and returned his eyes to my face. I could feel myself fading. I had no power over it.
- So how...? - he said. I shrugged my shoulders.
- I find these X-ray sermons about the grandeur of man to be clownish. And so do you. Maybe not?
- Yes?
- Yes.
- That's very good,' he said and u-smiled, as if I had granted his wish. - So you are against this Sartorius story.
I still didn't grasp how it had happened, but I could tell from the look in his eyes that he had led me where he wanted me to go. I remained silent; what could I say now?
- Perfect," he said. - Because there is a second project. To rebuild Roche's apparatus.
- The annihilator...?
- Yes. Sartorius has already done the preliminary calculations. It's feasible. And it won't even require a lot of power. The apparatus will be active round the clock or indefinitely, producing an antifield.
- Wait... wait! How do you imagine it!
- Very simply. It will be a neu-trin antifield. Ordinary matter remains unchanged.
Only the... neutrino systems. Do you understand?
He smiled with satisfaction. I sat with my mouth half-open. Slowly he stopped smiling.
He looked at me investigatively, with a wrinkled forehead, and waited.
- The first draft of 'Think' is therefore rejected. What? The second? Sartorius is already in on it. We'll call it 'Freedom'.
I closed my eyes for a moment. I suddenly made up my mind. Snaut was not a physicist. Sartorius had turned off or destroyed the visophone. Very well.
- I would rather call it "Slaughterhouse".... - I said slowly.
- You were a butcher yourself. Maybe not? And now it will be something completely different. No 'guests', no F creations - nothing. Already at the moment of materialisation - there will be disintegration. - It's a misunderstanding - I replied by shaking my head with a smile, I hoped it was natural enough. - It's not moral scruples, it's self-preservation instinct. I don't want to die, Snaut.
- What...?
He was surprised. He looked at me suspiciously. I pulled a crumpled piece of pattern paper out of my pocket.
- I thought about it too. Are you surprised? After all, I was the one who first put forward the neutrino hypothesis, maybe not? Look. Antipoles can be induced. For ordinary matter, it is harmless. This is true. But at the moment of destabilisation, when the neutrino system collapses, the energy of its bonds is released as a surplus. Assuming ten to eight ergs per kilogram of rest mass, we get for one creation F - five to seven times ten to eight. Do you know what this means? The equivalent of a small uranium charge exploding inside a
Station.
- What are you saying! But... but Sartorius must have taken that into account....
- 'Not necessarily,' I denied with a mischievous smile. - You see, the thing is that Sartorius is of the Frazer and Cajolla school. According to them, all the energy of the bonds at the moment of decay is released in the form of light radiation. It would simply be a strong flash, not quite safe perhaps, but not destructive. However, there are other hypotheses, other theories of the neutrino field. According to Cayatt, according to Avalov, according to Siona, the emission spectrum is much broader, with a maximum at hard gamma rays. It's nice that Sartorius believes his masters and their theories, but there are others, Snaut. And you know what I'm going to tell you? - I continued, seeing that my words had made an impression on him. - The ocean must also be taken into account. If he did what he did, he certainly used the optimal method. In other words: his action seems to me to be an argument for the latter school - against Sartorius.
- Give me that piece of paper, Kelvin.... I handed it to him. He tilted his head, trying to read my scribbles.
- What's this? - He pointed with his finger. I took the piece of paper from him.
- This? The field transmutation tensor.
- Give it to me...
- What do you need it for? - I asked. I knew what he would answer.
- I have to show Sartorius.
- As you wish - I replied indifferently. - I can give it to you. Only you see, this is something no one has studied experimentally, we didn't know such systems yet. He believes in Frazer, and I calculated according to Siona. He will tell you that I am not a physicist and Siona is not one either. At least in his understanding. But that is a matter for discussion. I do not wish a discussion in which I may evaporate to the greater glory of Sartorius as a result. I can convince you, he cannot. And I will not try.
- So what do you want to do...? He's working on it,' Snaut said in a colourless voice. He scowled, all his animation gone. I didn't know if he trusted me, but it was all the same to me now.
- It's what the man they're trying to kill does - I replied quietly.
- I will try to contact him. Maybe he's thinking about some security measures,' Snaut muttered. He raised his eyes at me: - 'Listen, what if, after all...? That first draft. What? Sartorius would agree. For sure. It's... in any case... some chance...
- Do you believe it?
- No - he replied immediately. - But... what's the harm?
I didn't want to agree too quickly, that's what I wanted. He was becoming my ally in the blame game.
- I'll think about it - I said.
- Well, I'll go," he muttered, standing up. All his bones shook as he rose from his chair. - 'So you're going to give yourself an encephalo-game? - He asked, rubbing the surface of his apron with his fingers as if he was trying to wipe off an invisible stain.
- 'Fine,' I said. Paying no attention to Harey (she was looking at the scene, silently, with a book in her lap), he walked to the door. When it closed behind him, I stood up. I unfolded the sheet of paper I held in my hand. The patterns were reliable. I had not falsified them. I just don't know if Siona would have admitted to my unfolding. Not likely. I twitched. Harey came up from behind me and touched my shoulder.
- Kris!
- What, darling?
- Who was that?
- I told you. Dr Snaut.
- Who's that man?
- I don't know him much. Why do you ask?
- The way he looked at me...
- He must have liked you.
- No - she shook her head. - It wasn't that kind of look. He looked at me like... like... She shuddered, raised her eyes to me and lowered them immediately.
-Let's get somewhere...
