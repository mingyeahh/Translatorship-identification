The next three weeks were like one and the same day over and over again, the window lids slid open and up, at night I crawled from one nightmare into another, in the morning we would get up and the game would begin, but was it a game? I pretended to be calm and Harey pretended it, this tacit understanding, the knowledge of mutual deception, became our last escape. Because we talked a lot about how we were going to live on Earth, how we would settle down somewhere under a big city and never give up the blue sky and. green trees again, and we invented together the interior of our future house and garden, and we even argued over details about the hedge, about the bench.... did I believe it for a second? No. I knew it was impossible. I knew it was. Because even if it could leave the Station - alive - only a man can land on Earth, and a man is his papers. The first inspection would have ended that escape. They would have tried to identify her, so they would have disconnected us first and that would have given her away right away. The station was the only place we could live together. Did Harey know about this? She certainly did. Did anyone tell her? In the light of everything that had happened - probably yes.
One night I heard Harey get up quietly in her sleep. I wanted to take her in. Already only silent, already only in the darkness, we could still become free for a moment, in a perdition which the despair surrounding us from everywhere made only a momentary suspension of torture. She didn't seem to notice that I had woken up. Before I could reach out my hand, she was off the bed. I heard - still only half-awake - the sound of barefoot footsteps. A vague fear seized me.
- Harey? - I whispered. I wanted to shout, but didn't dare. I sat down on the bed. The door leading into the corridor was all but closed. A thin needle of light slanted across the cabin.
I seemed to hear muffled voices. Was she talking to someone? With whom? I jumped out of bed, but such monstrous fear gripped me that my legs refused to obey me. I stood for a moment listening - it was quiet. I slowly dragged myself back to bed. Pulses rumbled in my head. I started counting. At a thousand I paused, the door slid open silently, Harey slipped into the middle and stood still, as if listening to my breathing. I tried to make it steady. - Kris...? - she whispered softly. I did not speak. She slid quickly into bed. I felt her lying upright, and I lay beside her, numb, I don't know how long. I tried to form questions, but the more time passed, the more I understood that I would not speak first. After some time, maybe an hour, I fell asleep.
The morning was the same as always. I looked at her suspiciously only when she couldn't see it. After lunch, we sat side by side in front of a curved window with low, red clouds streaming past. The station glided among them like a ship. Harey was reading a book of some sort, and I lingered in one of the stares that so often now became the only respite. I noticed that by tilting my head in a certain way I could see the reflection of us both in the glass, clear but distinct. I took my hand off the railing. Harey - I could see it in the glass - having made sure with a quick glance that I was looking into the ocean, leaned over the railing and touched her lips to the spot I had just touched. I sat on, unnaturally stiff, and she leaned her head over the book.
- 'Harey,' I said quietly, 'where did you go out tonight?
- At night?
- Yes.
- Something... You were dreaming, Kris. I wasn't going out anywhere.
- You weren't going out?
- No. You must have been dreaming.
- It could be - I said. - Yes, it's possible that I was dreaming....
In the evening, when we were already lying down, I started talking again about our journey, about returning to Earth.
- Ah, I don't want to hear about it - she said. - Don't talk, Kris. After all, you know... - What?
- Nothing. Nothing.
When we were already lying down, she said she was thirsty.
- There's a glass of juice over there on the table, pass it to me, please.
She drank half of it and handed it to me. I didn't feel like drinking.
- To my health - she smiled. I drank the juice, which seemed a little salty, but I didn't pay attention to it.
- If you don't want us to talk about the Earth, then what? - I asked when she turned out the light. - Would you have married if I hadn't been there?
- No.
- Never?
- Never.
- Why?
- I don't know. I was alone for ten years and I didn't marry. Let's not talk about it, darling....
I was groggy as if I had drunk at least a flask of wine.
- No, let's talk, let's just talk. What if I asked you?
- For me to marry you? Nonsense, Harey. I don't need anyone but you.
She leaned over me. I could feel her breath on my lips, she embraced me so tightly that the unstoppable drowsiness that was engulfing me retreated for a blink.
- Say it another way.
- I love you.
She slapped her forehead against my shoulder, I felt the twitch of her tense eyelids and the wetness of her tears.
- Harey, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. - She repeated more and more quietly. I tried to open my eyes, but they were closing by themselves.
I don't know when I fell asleep.
A red dawn woke me up. My head was leaden and my neck stiff, as if all my vertebrae had fused into one bone. With my rough, nasty tongue I could not move my mouth. I must have poisoned myself with something,' I thought, lifting my head with an effort. I reached my hand towards Harey. It hit the cold sheet.
I pulled myself up.
The bed was empty, in the cabin - no one. Red discs repeated the reflections of the sun disc in the windows. I jumped to the floor. I must have looked comical, because I staggered like a drunk. I grabbed onto appliances, caught up with the wardrobe - the bathroom was empty. The corridor too. And there was no one in the studio.
- Harey!!! - I shouted in the middle of the corridor, paddling unconsciously with my hands. - Harey... - I yelled out again, already knowing.
I don't remember exactly what happened next. I must have been running, half-naked, all over the Station, I recall even running into the cold room and then into the last storeroom and banging my fists on the sliding doors. I may even have been in there a few times. The stairs rumbled, I tumbled, broke free, rushed somewhere again, until I reached the transparent barrier behind which is the exit to the outside: the double armoured doors. I pushed them with all my might and screamed for it to be a dream. And someone had been at my side for some time and was tugging at me, pulling me somewhere. Then I was in a small workshop, with my shirt wet with icy water, my hair sticky, my nostrils 'and tongue baked with spirit, I was half lying panting, on something cold, metal, and Snaut in his stained linen trousers was fussing with the medicine cabinet, knocking something over, tools and glassware making a terrible noise.
Suddenly I saw him in front of me, looking into my eyes, attentive, hunched over. - Where is she?
- She's not there.
- But, but Harey...
- 'There is no more Harey,' he said slowly, clearly, bringing his face close to mine, as if he had dealt me a blow,
and now he was watching its effect.
- He'll be back... - I whispered, closing my eyes. And for the first time I wasn't really afraid of that. I wasn't afraid of a spectral return. I didn't understand how I could ever fear it!
- Drink this.
He handed me a glass of warm liquid. I looked at it and at once splashed the entire contents in his face. He stepped back, wiping his eyes. When he opened them, I was standing over him. He was so small.
- Is that you!
- What are you talking about?
- Don't lie, you know what. Was it you who talked to her that night? And you told her to give her a sleeping agent for that...? What did you do with her!!!? Speak up!!!
He searched on his chest. He took out a crumpled envelope. I snatched it from him. It was sealed. Nothing on the top. I tore open the paper. A sheet of paper, folded in four, fell out of the middle. Large, slightly childish writing in uneven rows. I recognised it.
"Dear me, I'm the one who asked him first. He is good. Terrible that I had to lie to you, there was no other way. You can do one thing for me - listen to him and don't do anything to yourself. You were great."
There was one crossed-out word underneath, I managed to read it: "Harey" she wrote, then blurred it, there was another letter like H or K, turned into a blotch. I read it once and then again. And again. I was already too sober to be hysterical, I couldn't even moan, make a sound.
- How? - I whispered. - How?
- Then, Kelvin. Hold on.
- I'm holding. Tell me. How?
- Annihilation.
- What do you mean, but the camera! - it picked me up.
- Roche's apparatus was not suitable. Sarto-rius had built another, a special destabiliser. A small one. It only works within a few metres.
- What about her...?
- She disappeared. A flash and a blast. A faint blast. Nothing more.
- In a small radius, you say?
- Yes. There were no materials for the big one. Suddenly the walls began to lean on me. I closed my eyes. - God... she... she'll be back, she'll be back after all...
- No.
- What do you mean no...?
- No, Kelvin. Remember those rising foams? They haven't come back since.
- Not anymore?
- No.
- You killed her,' I said quietly.
- Yes. You wouldn't have done it? In my place?
I broke off and started walking faster and faster. From the wall to the corner and back again. Nine steps. A turnaround. Nine steps.
I stood in front of him.
- Listen, we're going to make a report. We'll request direct communication with the Council. It can be done They will agree. They have to. The planet will be excluded from the Convention of the Four. All means permitted. We will bring in antimatter generators. Do you think there is anything that can resist antimatter? There is nothing!
Nothing! Nothing! - I shouted triumphantly, blind from tears.
- Do you want to destroy it? - he said. - For what?
- Get out. Leave me!
- I won't go.
- Snaut!
I looked into his eyes. 'No,' he said with a movement of his head.
- 'What do you want? What do you want from me?
He backed away from the table.
- 'All right. We'll report back.
I turned around and started walking.
- Sit down.
- Give me a break.
- There are two things. The first is the facts. The second is our demands.
- Shall we talk about it now?
- Yes, now.
- I don't want to. Do you understand? I don't care about anything.
- The last time we sowed a message was before Gibarian died. It's been upwards of two months.
We should be able to determine the exact course of the appearance of...
- You won't stop? - I grabbed him by the arm.
- You can beat me,' he said, 'but I'm still going to talk. I let him go.
- Do what you want.
- The point is that Sartorius will try to hide certain facts. I'm almost certain of that.
- Aren't you?
- No. Not anymore. It's not just about us. It's about, you know, what it's about. It has demonstrated rational action. A capacity for organic synthesis of the highest order that we don't know. It knows the structure, the microstructure, the metabolism of our bodies....
- Good - I said. - Why did you stop talking? He performed a series on us... series... experiments. A mental vivisection. Based on knowledge, stolen from our heads, with no regard for what we aspire to.
- They are no longer facts or even conclusions, Kelvin. They are hypotheses. In a sense, they counted for what some closed, secretive part of our minds wanted. It could have been - gifts....
- Gifts! Great God! I started laughing.
- Stop it - he shouted, grabbing my hand. I squeezed his fingers. I squeezed tighter and tighter until my knuckles crunched. He looked at me with squinted eyes, without a twitch. I let go of him and walked away to a corner. Facing the wall, I said:
- I'll try not to get hysterical.
- Never mind all that. What shall we demand?
- You say. I can't now. Did she say anything before...?
- No. Nothing. As far as I'm concerned, I think an opportunity has now arisen.
- Chance? What chance? For what? Aa... - I said more quietly, looking into his eyes, as I understood suddenly. - Contact? Contact again? We're still small - and you, yourself, and the whole madhouse....
Contact? No, no, no. Without me.
- Why? - he asked quite calmly. - Kelvin, you still, and now more than ever, instinctively, treat him like a human being. You hate him.
- And you don't...? - I chuckled.
- No. Kelvin, after all, he is blind....
- Blind? - I repeated, uncertain if I had heard correctly.
- Of course, in our understanding. We do not exist for him as we do for each other. The surface of the face, of the body that we see, makes us known as individuals. It is a transparent pane of glass for him. He has, after all, penetrated inside our brains.
- So that's fine. But so what? What is your point? If he was able to animate, to create a human being that doesn't exist, outside of my memory, and in such a way that her eyes, her movements, her voice.... voice...
- Go on! Go on! you hear!!!
- I'm talking... I'm saying... Yes. So... voice... from that, it can read in us like a book.
Do you know what I'm trying to say?
- Yes. That if he wanted to, he could communicate with us?
- Naturally. Isn't that obvious?
- No. Not at all. After all, he could only take a production prescription, which does not consist of words. As a fixed memory record, it is a protein structure. Like the head of a sperm or an egg. There, after all, in the brain, there are no words, no feelings; a person's memory is an image, written down in the language of nucleic acids on large-molecule asynchronous crystals. So he took what was apparently etched in us, the most closed, the most complete, the most deeply imprinted, you understand? But he didn't need to know at all what it was for us, what meaning it had. It's as if we could create a symmetry and throw it into the ocean, knowing the architecture, the technology and the building materials, but not understanding what it's for, what it serves, what it is for him....
- It's possible,' I said. - Yes, it is possible. In that case, he didn't ... maybe he didn't want to trample us like that and squash us at all. It could be. And only inadvertently... My mouth started to fly.
- Kelvin!
- Yes, yes. All right? Nothing anymore. You're good. So is he. They're all good. But why? Explain to me. Why? What did he do it for? What did you tell her?
- The truth.
- The truth, the truth! What?
- You know. Come to me now. We're going to write the report. Come on.
- Wait. What do you actually want? You're not going to stay at the Station...?
-I want to stay. Yes.
