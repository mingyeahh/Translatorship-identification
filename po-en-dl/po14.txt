I sat at the big window and looked out at the ocean. I had nothing to do. The report, compiled in five days, was now a beam of waves, rushing through a vacuum somewhere beyond the constellation Orion. When it reached the dark dust nebula, which spreads over an area of eight trillion cubic miles and absorbs every signal and ray of light, it would encounter the first of a chain of relays. From there, from one radiobeacon to the next, in leaps of billions of kilometres, it will glide along the curvature of a giant arc until the last relay, a metallic lump, full of tightly packed precision instruments, with an elongated snout of a directional antenna, focuses it once more and presses it further into space, towards Earth. Then, months will pass, and the same burst of energy, dragging behind it a furrow of percussive distortions in the gravitational field of the Galaxy, launched from the Earth, will reach the front of the cosmic cloud, glide, amplified along a necklace of slowly drifting buoys, and, with undiminished vigour, will hurtle towards the twin suns of Solaris. The ocean under the high red sun was blacker than ever. A red mist melted its contacts with the sky, this day was exceptionally steamy, as if it heralded one of those exceedingly rare and beyond imagination violent storms that haunt the planet several times a year. There is reason to believe that its sole inhabitant controls the climate and brings these storms on its own. For a few more months I was to look out of these windows, to watch from a height the freedoms of white gold and weary red, occasionally reflected in some liquid eruption, in a silvery bubble of symmetry, to follow the wandering of wind-slanted, slender chisels, to encounter half-weathered, sludgy mimoids. One day, all the screens of the visophones will start fluttering with light, all the electron signalling, long dead, will come to life, triggered by a pulse, sent from hundreds of thousands of kilometres away, heralding the approach of a metallic colossus which, with a draughty thunder of gravitors, will lower itself over the ocean. It will be Ulysses or
Prometheus, or some other of the great long-range cruisers. As I ascend the gangway from the flat roof of the Station, I will see on the decks ranks of white-armoured, massive automatons that share no original sin with man and are so innocent that they will obey any order until they have completely destroyed themselves or any obstacle that stands in their way, if that is how their crystal oscillating memory has been programmed. And then the ship will move, silently, faster than a voice, leaving behind an ocean-reaching cone of thunder split into bass octaves, and the faces of all the people will light up for a moment at the thought that they are coming home.
But I had no home. Earth? I thought of its great, crowded, sweltering cities, where I would get lost, lose myself almost as if I had done what I wanted to do the second or third night - throw myself into the ocean, rippling hard in the darkness. I will drown in people. I will be a silent and attentive, and thus a valued companion, I will have many acquaintances, even friends, and women, and maybe even one woman. For a time, I will have the compulsion to smile, to bow, to stand up, to do the thousands of small actions of which earthly life consists, until I no longer feel it. I will find new interests, new activities, but I will not give myself over to them all. To nothing or no one, ever again. And perhaps, I will look at night where, in the sky, the darkness of the dust cloud like a black veil holds back the radiance of two suns, remembering everything, even what I think now, and I will remember with an indulgent smile, in which there will be a hint of regret, but also of superiority, my follies and hopes. I do not at all consider this self from the future as something inferior to Kelvin, who was ready to do anything for the cause, called Contact. And no one will have the right to judge me.
Snaut entered the cabin. He looked around, then looked at me, I got up and walked over to the table.
- Did you want something?
- You seem to have nothing to do...? - He asked winking. - I could give you, you know, there are some calculations, not the most urgent admittedly....
- Thank you,' I smiled, 'but it's unnecessary.
- Are you sure about that? - He asked looking at the window.
- Yes. I was thinking about things and....
- I'd rather you didn't think so much.
- Ah, then you're completely missing the point. Tell me, do you... do you believe in God? He looked at me sharply.
- What do you? Who still believes today... There was anxiety smouldering in his eyes.
- 'It's not that simple,' I said in a deliberately light tone, 'because I don't mean the traditional God of earthly beliefs. I'm not a religionist and I may not have invented anything, but you don't happen to know if there was once a belief in a God.... flawed?
- Crippled? - He repeated raising his eyebrows. - How do you understand that? In a sense, the god of every religion was flawed, because he was burdened with human qualities, magnified only. The god of
of the Old Testament, for example, was a lusty frontal and sacrificial violent man, jealous of the other gods.... the Greek gods, through their quarrelsomeness, family feuds, were no less humanly flawed....
- 'No,' I interrupted him, 'what I mean is a God whose imperfection is not due to the simple-mindedness of his human creators, but is his most essential, immanent characteristic. It is to be a God, limited in his omniscience and omnipotence, fallible in foreseeing the future of his creations, whose course of the phenomena shaped by him can cause horror. It is a God ... crippled, who always wants more than he can, and does not immediately realise it. One who has constructed clocks, but not the time they measure. Systems or mechanisms, serving certain purposes, but they outgrew those purposes and betrayed them. And he created infinity, which, from being the measure of his power it was meant to be, became the measure of his boundless failure.
- Once, Manichaeism ... - began hesitantly, Snaut. The suspicious reserve with which he had addressed me in recent times was gone.
- 'But this has nothing to do with the element of good and evil,' I interrupted him immediately. - This God does not exist outside of matter and cannot free himself from it, and that is all he wants.... - I know of no similar religion - he said after a moment's silence. - Such has never been ... needed. If I understand you correctly, and I'm afraid I do, you're thinking of some kind of evolving god who develops over time and grows up, ascending to ever higher heights of power, to an awareness of its powerlessness? This God of yours is a being who entered divinity as if it were a no-win situation, and having grasped this, gave himself over to despair. Yes, but a God in despair is a human being after all, my dear? You mean a human being... It's not only poor philosophy, it's even poor mysticism. - 'No,' I replied stubbornly, 'I don't mean a human being. It may be that with certain features he would fit this provisional definition, but that is only because it is full of gaps. Man, contrary to appearances, does not create goals for himself. They are imposed on him by the time in which he is born; he can serve them or rebel against them, but the object of service or rebellion is given from outside. In order to experience the total freedom of seeking goals, he would have to be alone, and this cannot happen, because a man not brought up among men cannot become a man. This ... mine must be a being without a plural, you know?
- 'Ah,' he said, 'that I immediately...' And he pointed with his hand out of the window.
- No - I objected - and neither did he. At the most, as that which has missed the chance of divinity in its development, having too soon become obscured in itself. He is an anachoretic, a hermit of the cosmos rather than its god.... He repeats himself, Snaut, and the one I'm thinking of would never do so. Perhaps he is being created somewhere, in some corner of the Galaxy, and soon he will begin, in a fit of youthful intoxication, to extinguish some stars and ignite others we will notice after a while....
- We have already noticed," said Snaut sourly. - Novae and Supernovae... are these, in your opinion, the candles of his altar?
- If you want to take what I say so literally....
- Or perhaps it is Solaris that is the cradle of your divine infant,' Snaut added. An increasingly clear smile surrounded his eyes with thin wrinkles. - 'Perhaps he is, in your understanding, the very first-born, the seed of the God of despair, perhaps his vital childishness still surpasses his wits by mountains, and all that our Solaris libraries contain is but a vast catalogue of his infantile reflexes....
- And we, on the other hand, were his toys for a time - I finished. - Yes, it is possible. And do you know what you managed to do? You have created a completely new hypothesis about Solaris, which is no small thing! And immediately you have an explanation for the inability to make contact, the lack of answers, certain - let's call them that - extravagances in dealing with us; the psyche of a small child....
- He gives up the authorship - he muttered standing by the window. For a long moment we stared into the black undulation. At the eastern horizon a pale, oblong speck was drawn in the mist. - Where did you get this idea of a flawed God? - he asked suddenly, without taking his eyes off the glare-drenched desert.
- I don't know. It just seemed very, very real to me, you know? It's the only God I'd be willing to believe in, whose passion is not redemptive, doesn't save anything, doesn't serve anything, just is.
- Mimoid... - said quite quietly, in a different voice Snaut.
- What are you saying? A yes. I noticed him before. Very old.
We both stared into the hazy ruddy horizon....
- I'll fly - I spoke up unexpectedly. - Especially as I've never left the Station before, and this is a good opportunity. I'll be back in half an hour...
- What do you say? - Snaut opened his eyes. - Are you going to fly? To where?
- Over there - I pointed to a flesh-coloured spot peeking through the fog. - 'What's the harm in that? I'll take a small helicopter. It would be funny, you know, if - on Earth - I had to admit one day that I'm a solarian who's never even set foot on solarian ground....
I walked over to the wardrobe and started flicking between suits. Snaut watched me, silently, until he said:
- I don't like this.
- What - I turned around with the suit in my hands. I was overwhelmed by an excitement I had not experienced for a long time. - What do you mean? Cards on the table! You're afraid that something... nonsense! I give you my word, no. I didn't even think about it. No, I really haven't.
- I'll fly with you.
- Thank you, but I prefer alone. It's something new though, something completely new,' I said quickly, pulling on the suit. Snaut said something else, but I didn't really listen to him, looking for the things I needed.
He followed me to the airport. He helped me roll the machine out of the box to the centre of the launch pad.
As I was putting on my flight suit, he suddenly asked:
- Does the word still have any value for you?
- Great God, Snaut, do you still? It has. And I've already given it to you. Where are the reserve cylinders?
He said nothing more. When I closed the transparent dome, I gave him a sign with my hand. He started the jack, I drove slowly out to the top of the Station. The motor woke up, made a draughty noise, the tri-propeller whirred and the apparatus lifted strangely slightly, leaving the Station's ever-smaller, silvery disk below.
I was alone over the ocean for the first time; a very different sensation from that experienced at the windows. Perhaps the lowness of the flight also caused this; I was gliding only a few dozen metres above the waves. Only now I not only knew, but felt, that the alternating, greasily glistening humps and chasms of the abyss were moving not like a sea tide or a cloud, but like an animal. The relentless, though remarkably slow, contractions of the muscular, naked hull - that's what it looked like; the sleepily turning crest of each wave blazed red with foam; when I made a turn to come out exactly on the course of the mimic island drifting with extraordinary slowness, the sun hit me straight in the eyes, trembled with flashes of blood in the convex panes, and the ocean itself became ink-red with mottles of dark fire.
The circle I'd made, not skilled enough, carried me far upwind, and the mimoid was left behind as a vast, bright blotch, cut off from the ocean by an irregular contour. It had lost the pink hue given to it by the mists, it was as yellowish as dried bone, and for a moment it disappeared from my sight, and instead I saw the Station in the distance, hovering seemingly just above the ocean itself, like a huge, old-fashioned zeppelin. I repeated the manoeuvre, straining all my attention: the mimic massif, with its steep, grotesque sculpture was growing on course. I thought I might catch the tallest of its bulbous protrusions, and I pulled the helicopter up so violently that, losing speed, the whole thing rocked; caution superfluous as the rounded tops of the bizarre towers sailed low below. I aligned the machine's flight with the drifting island and slowly, metre by metre, began to lose altitude until the crumbling peaks rose above the cabin. It wasn't huge. From end to end it was perhaps three-quarters of a mile long, and barely a few hundred metres wide; in some places it showed a narrowing that heralded the fact that it would soon break through there. It must have been a fragment of an incomparably larger formation; according to the Solarian scale it was a tiny splinter, a remnant, God knows how many weeks and months old.
I discovered - between the vein-like heights broken off by the ocean itself - a sort of shore, a few dozen square metres of rather sloping but almost flat surface, and directed the machine there. The landing turned out to be more difficult than I thought it would be, I would have nearly knocked the propeller into the wall growing in front of me, but I managed. I immediately extinguished the engine and threw the dome back. I investigated further, standing on the wing, to see if the helicopter was in danger of sliding into the ocean; the waves licked the toothy edge about a dozen paces from my landing site, but it stood firmly on its widely spaced skids. I jumped down to ... "the ground." What I had taken before to be the wall I had almost stepped over was a huge, gash-like, membrane-thin, bony slab, set stiffly, overgrown with galley-like thickenings. A gap, several metres wide, divided the whole of this several-storey plane diagonally, revealing - like its large, irregularly scattered openings - a perspective of depth. I climbed the nearest sloping span of the wall, finding that the suit's boots were remarkably grippy and that the suit itself did not impede movement at all, and, finding myself some four storeys above the ocean, facing into the skeletal landscape, it was only now that I was able to encompass it thoroughly with my eyes.
The resemblance to an archaic city half-turned into rubble, some exotic Moroccan settlement centuries ago, battered by an earthquake or other cataclysm, was startling. I could clearly see the winding, partially buried and debris-clogged gullies of the streets, their intricate, steep confluences towards the shore, washed by a smear of foam, the surviving blanks above, the bastions, their outlandish settlements, and in the convex and congealed walls the black openings, similar to crushed windows or fortress outlets. The whole island, leaning heavily to one side, like a half-sunken ship, glided ahead in a senseless, unconscious movement, turning very slowly, as evidenced by the apparent movement of the sun in the firmament, raising lazy shadows crawling between the nooks and crannies of the ruins; occasionally a sunbeam would slip out from among them, reaching the spot where I stood. I climbed even higher, risking a lot already, until, from the overhanging and overhanging growths above my head, fine rubble began to fall in streams; falling down, it filled the winding gullies and streets with great clouds of dust; mimoid is not naturally a rock and its resemblance to limestone disappears when you take a splinter in your hand; it is far lighter than pumice stone, fine-cellular; it is extremely airy.
I was already so high up that I could feel its movement: not only did it swim ahead, pushed by the thrusts of the ocean's black muscles, from no one knows where, to no one knows where, but it also tilted, once to one side and once to the other, extraordinarily slowly, each of these pendulous wobbles accompanied by the draughty, viscous hum of burly and yellow foam dripping from the emergent edge. This swaying motion had been imparted to it a very long time ago, probably at birth, preserved by its enormous mass; having watched from my aerial position as much as I could, I carefully glided down; and it was only then - a strange thing - that I realised that the mimoid did not interest me at all, that I had flown here to meet not it but the ocean.
I sat down on the rough, cracked surface, with the helicopter a dozen paces behind me. A black wave crept hard onto the shore, flattening out and losing its colour at the same time; when it receded, trembling threads of slime ran down the edge of the talus. I slipped even lower and reached out towards the next one. It then faithfully repeated that phenomenon, first experienced by humans almost a century ago: it hesitated, retreated, poured over my hand without touching it, so that a thin layer of air remained between the surface of the glove and the inside of the hollow, which immediately changed consistency, becoming from liquid almost fleshy. I then raised my hand slowly, the wave, or rather a narrow spur of it, followed it upwards, still surrounding my hand with an increasingly luminous, dirty-greenish plume. I stood up, because otherwise I could not raise my hand higher; the isthmus of gelatinous substance tightened like a flailing string, but did not break; the base of the completely flattened wave, like a strange creature patiently awaiting the end of this experience, clung to the shore around my feet (without touching them either). It was as if a malleable flower had sprung from the ocean, its calyx encircling my toes, becoming the exact, though not touching, negative of them. I stepped back. The stem trembled and, as if reluctantly, came back down, flexible, shaky, unsteady, a wave surged pulling it into itself and it disappeared over the edge of the shore. I repeated this game until, again as a century ago, one wave indifferently drifted away, as if satiated by a new sensation, and I knew that I would have to wait several hours for her "curiosity" to awaken. I sat up as before, but as if transformed by this, from theory, so familiar a phenomenon I had evoked; theory could not, could not, convey the real experience.
In the budding, growth, spread of this vivarium, in each of its movements separately and in all of them at once, there was manifested a kind of - one would like to say - cautious but not timid naivety, when it tried to memorise and quickly get to know, to embrace a new, unexpectedly met shape, and halfway had to retreat, when it threatened to cross the mysteriously established limits. How indescribably this agile curiosity contrasted with the vastness that reached out in the splendour of all horizons. Never before had I felt such an immense presence of it, a strong, absolute silence, breathing steadily in waves. Stunned, stupefied, I descended into seemingly inaccessible regions of inertia and, in the increasing intensity of the obliteration, united myself with this liquid, blind colossus, as if, without the slightest effort, without words, without a single thought, I forgave it everything.
I had behaved so sensibly throughout the past week that the distrustful gleam of Snaut's eyes had finally ceased to haunt me. Outwardly I was calm, secretly without realising it clearly, I was expecting something. What? Her return? How could I? Each of us knows that we are material beings, subject to the laws of physiology and physics, and that the force of all our feelings put together cannot fight these laws, can only hate them. The eternal belief of lovers and poets in the power of love, which is more lasting than death, this finis vitae sed non amoris pursuing us through the ages, is a lie. But this lie is only futile, not ridiculous. To be, on the other hand, a clock that measures the passage of time, alternately shattered and reassembled, in whose mechanism, when the constructor pushes the cogs, despair and love begin to follow with their first movement, to know that one is a repetition of an ordeal, all the more profound the more comical it becomes through the multitude of repetitions? To repeat a human existence, fine, but to repeat it as a drunkard repeats a clichéd melody, dropping ever new coppers into the depths of a jukebox? Not even for a moment did I believe that this liquid colossus, who has condemned many hundreds of people to death within himself, with whom my entire race has tried in vain for decades to establish even a thread of understanding, that he, floating me involuntarily like a grain of gunpowder, would be moved by the tragedy of two people. But his actions were directed towards some goal. True, even that I was not quite sure. To leave, however, meant to cross out this, perhaps faint, perhaps in the imagination only existing chance that the future concealed. And so the years among the equipment, the things we had touched together, in the air that still remembered her breath? In the name of what? The hope of her return? I had no hope. But an expectation lived in me, the last thing I had left of her. What fulfilment, what derision, what torment did I still expect? I knew nothing abiding in the unshakeable faith that the time of cruel miracles had not passed.
