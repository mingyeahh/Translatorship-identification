The next day, after lunch, I found a note from Snaut on my table: Sartorius had postponed the construction of the annihilator and was about to project a powerful beam of rays into the ocean one last time. - Harey, my dear, I must go to Snaut. The red dawn blazed through the window and divided the room into two parts. We stood in a region of blue shadow. Beyond this shadowy area, everything was coppery; if a book had fallen from its shelf, my ear would instinctively have been alert for a metallic ringing. - This is the experience. Only I don't know how to do it. You see, I'd rather... I interrupted myself. - Kris, you don't have to justify yourself! I would so much like to... if it didn't last too long. - It will be for a while. Listen, do you think you could wait in the hallway? - I'll try. What if I can't control myself? - What exactly do you feel? - I added hastily: I'm not asking you out of indiscretion, don't get me wrong, but if we dig a little deeper, you might find a way to control yourself. - I'm afraid," she said. - She had turned pale. - I can't even explain to you what I'm afraid of, because I'm not actually afraid of anything or anyone. I... I feel lost. And I feel terribly ashamed of myself. Then when you come back, it's over. That's why I thought it was a disease... She was talking in a low voice and shaking.

- Maybe it's only in this damned Station that you have terrors. I'll make sure we get out of here in a hurry. She widened her eyes: "Do you think that's possible? - Why not? I'm not a prisoner here. I'll have to talk to Snaut. How long do you think you can be alone? - She lowered her head: If I hear your voice, I think I'll manage to stay put. - I'd rather you didn't hear us. I have nothing to hide from you, but I don't know, I can't know, what Snaut will say. - Don't go on, I understand. I'll keep my distance, it's enough that I recognise the sound of your voice. - I'll phone him from the workshop. I'm not locking the doors. Harey nodded. I walked through the red zone; in contrast, and despite the lamps, the corridor seemed dark. The door to the workshop was open. The last traces of the night's events were the debris of the Deware bottle glowing under a row of liquid oxygen tanks. As I lifted the receiver, the small screen lit up; I dialled the number of the radio booth. Behind the dull glass, the bluish film of light burst forth; leaning sideways over the arm of a chair, Snaut looked me in the eye. - Hi," he said. - I found your ticket. I'd like to talk to you. Can I come over? - Yes, you can. Right now? - Yes. Excuse me, are you coming alone or... with someone? - Alone. Throwing forward his forehead, barred with thick wrinkles, his thin, burnt cheeks, he examined me through the curved glass - a strange fish in a strange aquarium. He said with a knowing look: "Well, well, I'm waiting for you.

When I went into my room I could vaguely make out Harey's figure beyond the curtain of red rays. - We can go now, my dear..." My voice failed me. Harey was sitting in an armchair, her arms folded under the armrests. Had she heard my steps too late? For a second I saw her struggle against the incomprehensible force within her, overcoming the horrible contraction of her whole body and finally relaxing. A blind fury, mixed with pity, suffocated me. In silence, we followed the long corridor with its multicoloured walls - the variety of colours, according to the architects, was supposed to facilitate our existence inside the armoured carapace. From a distance I saw that the door of the radio booth was ajar, showing a band of red light. I looked at Harey, who did not even attempt to smile; all the way here she had been preparing for a fight with herself, and now that the ordeal was approaching, her face was pale, shrunken. Fifteen paces from the door she stopped. I turned round and she pushed me with her fingertips. At once Snaut, my plans, the experience, the Station, all seemed paltry compared to the ordeal she was about to undergo. I didn't feel like a helper; I wanted to turn back. But a shadow cut off the reflection of the sun on the wall and I hurried into the cabin. Snaut had come to the door, as if he had intended to come out to meet me. The sun disk haloed him in a crimson glow, which seemed to radiate from his grey hair. We looked at each other for a moment without saying anything. He could study me at his leisure, but I could not see him, for I was dazzled by the glare of the window. I walked past Snaut and went to lean against a high desk, from which the flexible rods of the microphones emerged. Snaut turned slowly and continued to observe me with his usual smile, a grimace which did not express gaiety and more often than not betrayed unspeakable fatigue. With his eyes still fixed on me, he made his way through the heaps of objects piled up in disorder - thermal accumulators, instruments, spare parts for

radio installation. He approached a metal cupboard, pulled up a stool and sat down with his back against the cupboard door. I listened with concern; there was no sound from the corridor where I had left Harey. Why was Snaut silent? The silence between us was becoming awkward. I cleared my throat: "When will you be ready? - We could start today, but the recording takes some time. - Recording? You mean the encephalogram? - Yes, you agreed... what's wrong? - No, nothing. The silence continued again and Snaut resumed: - Did you have something to tell me? I whispered: - She knows... He frowned: - Ah? I had the impression that he wasn't really surprised. So why was he acting surprised? I lost all desire to confide in him. She began to suspect something since our conversation in the library, she spied on me, she added up the clues, then she found Gibarian's tape recorder and listened to the tape... With his back against the cupboard, he didn't move, but a faint glint came into his eyes. Standing beside the desk, I had the panel of the door ajar to the corridor in front of me. I lowered my voice again: "Last night, while I was sleeping, she tried to kill herself. There was a rustle of papers being blown away by a draught. I stopped talking, listening to what was happening in the corridor. The noise was not coming from the corridor, it was in the room. A mouse... A mouse! Nonsense. There were no mice here. On the sly I watched my companion. - I'm listening," he said quietly.

- Obviously, she didn't make it... at least she knows who she is. - Why are you telling me this? I didn't know what to say at the time, and then I mumbled: - To inform you... to tell you about the situation... - I warned you. In spite of myself, I raised my voice: - You mean you knew... - What you just told me? Of course not. But I explained the situation to you. When he arrives, the 'visitor' is more or less empty, he's just a ghost fed with confused memories and images, taken from his... Adam. The longer he stays with you, the more humanised he becomes. He also becomes more independent, to a certain extent. Snaut stopped, glanced up and down at me and reluctantly added: "She knows everything? - Yes, I've already told you. - She knows everything? She knows that she came here once and that you... - No! He smiled: - Look, Kelvin, if you're at this point... What do you want to do, do you want to leave the Station? - Yes. - With her? - Yes. He was silent, pondering his answer, but his silence also meant something else... what? Again I heard near me - without being able to place it and as if behind a thin wall - the rustle of an insensible air current in the room. Snaut shifted on his stool: - Very well, he said. What are you looking at me for? Did you think I would stand in your way? My dear Kelvin, you can do what you like. With the worries we have, we're not going to use coercion against each other on top of everything else! With no hope of you

convince you, I want to tell you this: In an inhumane situation, you try to keep a human attitude. This may be very nice, but it will get you nowhere. In fact, I am not so sure that it is beautiful. How can silly behaviour be beautiful? That's not the point, let's get back to business! You're not going to continue with the experiments, you want to leave and take him with you, yes? - Yes. - It's also... an experiment. Have you thought about it? - What do you mean? As long as she's with me, I don't see... Speaking more and more slowly, I stopped in the middle of my sentence. Snaut sighed: - We are all practising an ostrich policy, my dear Kelvin, and we know it. There's no need to put on a chivalrous air. - I'm not putting on any airs. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I'm taking off the chivalrous airs, but I'm keeping the ostrich policy, which you are practising in a particularly dangerous form. You lie to yourself, you lie to her, and you go around in circles. Do you know the conditions for stabilising a neutrino structure? - No, and neither do you. Nobody does. - That's right. We only know that such a structure is unstable and can only survive with a continuous flow of energy. I learned this from Sartorius. This energy creates a swirling stabilisation field. Is this magnetic field external to the 'visitor', or is it created inside his body? Do you understand the difference? - Yes... if it is external... she... Snaut concludes for me: - Away from Solaris, the structure disintegrates. Pure hypothesis, of course, but one you can verify, since you have already tried an experiment. The rocket you launched... it continues to gravitate. In my spare time, I have even calculated

the elements of its movement. You can take off, place yourself in orbit, approach and see what has become of the passenger... I shouted: - You are mad! - I shouted, "You're mad!" "Do you think so? What if we brought that rocket back here? No problem, it's remote-controlled. We'll get it out of orbit and... - Shut up! - No, you don't want to do that either? There is still a way, very simple. It won't be necessary to bring it back to the Station, it will continue to gravitate. It will be enough to establish a radio link. If she lives, she will answer and... - But... but she ran out of oxygen a long time ago! - Maybe it doesn't need oxygen. Shall we try? - Snaut... Snaut... He angrily monkeyed with me: - Kelvin... Kelvin... Think about it! Are you a man or not? Who are you trying to please? Who are you trying to save? You? Her? And which one? This one or that one? Don't you have enough courage to face them both? You can see that your behaviour is inconsiderate! I'm telling you for the last time, we are in a situation that is beyond morality. I heard the same rustling sound as before, and this time it sounded as if fingernails were scratching a wall. I don't know why I suddenly felt as passive and indifferent as a mule. I saw myself, I saw both of us from a great distance, through the small end of a spyglass, and everything seemed insignificant, negligible, a little laughable. I asked: "Well, what do you think I should do? Send her away? Tomorrow she'll be back, won't she? And the day after, and every day after that. For how long? What's the point of getting rid of her if she comes back? What good will it do me? And what benefit to you, to Sartorius, to the Station?

- No, here's what I suggest: Go with her! You will witness the transformation. After a few minutes, you'll see... Without enthusiasm, I interrupted him: - What? A monster, a demon? - No, you will see her die, quite simply. Do you really believe in her immortality? I assure you they die... What will you do then? Come back here... and replenish your supplies? Clenching my fists, I shouted: - Shut up! His eyelids wrinkled, he looked at me with condescending mockery: - Oh, I'm the one who has to shut up? It wasn't me who started this conversation, and I think it's gone on long enough! I would advise you to have other fun. You could, for example, go and whip the ocean with a rod, to get back at him! What do you think? That you are a scoundrel, if you send him away..." He waved his hand in a mocking farewell gesture and raised his head towards the ceiling, as if he were watching a rocket taking off. - And that you're an honest man, if you keep it? To smile when you feel like moaning, to pretend to be happy and peaceful when you want to bang your head against the walls, isn't that being a scoundrel? And if it is impossible, here, not to be a scoundrel? What are you going to do? Rage against that scoundrel Snaut, who is responsible for everything? Yes ? Then, my dear Kelvin, to make matters worse, you really are a complete idiot! With my chin down, I replied: "You speak for yourself... I... love him. - Who? His memory? - No, her. I told you what she wanted to do. Few genuine... human beings would have had the courage to do that. - By your own words, you acknowledge... Don't argue with me about the words! - Don't argue with me about the words! - Fine. So she loves you. And you want to love her. It is not the same thing. - You are mistaken.

- I'm sorry, Kelvin, but it was you who told me your intimate concerns. You don't love her. You love her. She is ready to give her life. So are you. It's very moving, it's beautiful, it's sublime, whatever you want. But here, it's inappropriate. This is not the place. Do you understand that? No, you refuse to understand. Unknown forces, independent of us, are pulling you into a circular process, of which she is an aspect, a phase, a periodic manifestation. If she were... if you were bothered by a devoted nanny, you wouldn't hesitate for a moment to send her away, would you? - Yes, I would. - Well, that's probably why she's not a nanny! Your hands are tied? That's what it's all about, your hands being tied! - It's just one more hypothesis, on top of a million others in the library. Leave me alone, Snaut, she's... No, I don't want to discuss it with you any more. - Fine. You started it. You started it. Just remember that she's a mirror in which part of your brain is reflected. If it's wonderful, it's because you have wonderful memories. You provided the recipe. You are caught in a circular process, don't forget that! - What do you want from me? That I... that I take him away? I already asked you the question: Why? You didn't answer. - I'll answer you. I didn't ask for this conversation. I didn't interfere in your affairs. I don't order you to do anything, I don't forbid you to do anything, and even if I had the right, I wouldn't do it. You came here of your own free will and unpacked everything in front of me. Do you know why? No ? To unburden yourself, to relieve yourself of a burden! Ah, my dear Kelvin, I know what that burden is. Oh, yes, and don't interrupt me! I leave you free to make your own decisions, while you desire opposition. If I stood in your way, you might try to beat me up. But you would be dealing with me, a man made of the same loam as you, a man of the same flesh and blood as you, and then

you too would feel like a man. As I don't give you the opportunity to fight, you argue with me... or rather, you argue with yourself! You have only to tell me that you would succumb to the pain if it suddenly disappeared... No, please, don't say anything! I replied awkwardly to his attack: "I came to inform you, out of simple honesty, that I intend to leave the Station with her. Snaut shrugged his shoulders: - You're not denying it... I only expressed my opinion because I see that you're getting ahead of yourself. And the higher you go, the harder you'll fall, as they say... Come tomorrow morning, around nine o'clock, to Sartorius' house... will you come? I was astonished: - At Sartorius'? I thought he didn't let anyone in. You told me that we couldn't even phone him. - It seems that he has arranged it somehow. We never talk about our domestic problems. You... that's entirely different. Will you come tomorrow morning? I growled, "I'll come. I looked at Snaut. His left hand had slipped inside the cupboard. How long had the door been ajar? Long enough, probably, but in the excitement of this horrible conversation I hadn't noticed. The position of that hand was unnatural. It looked as if he were hiding something. Or holding someone's hand. I moistened my lips: "Snaut, what are you..." "Get out," he said in a low voice, very quietly, "get out! I went out and closed the door in the last light of the red twilight. Ten paces from the door, Harey was waiting, sitting on the floor, glued to the wall. She jumped to her feet:

- You see," she said, looking at me with shining eyes. I did it, Kris... I'm so happy! Maybe... maybe it will get easier... I answered absent-mindedly: "Oh, yes, surely..." We went back to my house. We went back to my place. I had been thinking about that cupboard all along. My cheeks were beginning to burn so badly that I involuntarily stroked them with the back of my hand. What a stupid conversation! And to what end? Nothing. Ah, yes, tomorrow morning... Suddenly, fear seized me, a fear similar to the one I had felt the night before. My encephalogram. The complete record of my brain processes, transformed into a beam of rays, would be discharged into the ocean, into the depths of this inconceivable, infinite monster... What had Snaut said: "If it disappeared, you would suffer horribly? An encephalogram is a record of all processes - conscious and unconscious processes. If I want it to go away, will it go away? But if I wished to get rid of it, would I be as frightened by the thought of its threatened annihilation? Am I responsible for my unconscious? But who else would be responsible for it? Why did I agree to give them my encephalogram... I can obviously study the recording before allowing it to be used, but I won't be able to decipher it. No one can decipher it. Specialists can only circumscribe the subject's thoughts in general terms. They will say, for example, that the subject was thinking about the solution of a mathematical problem, but will be unable to specify the data of this problem. They are forced to stick to generalities, they say, because the encephalogram reproduces a multitude of processes taking place simultaneously, only some of which have a psychic "double". What about unconscious processes? The specialists absolutely refuse to talk about them. How can we expect them to decipher

But what am I so afraid of? I told Harey this very morning that the experiment will not succeed. If our neurophysiologists are unable to decipher the recording, how can this stranger, this black and fluid giant, be able to do so? He has penetrated me, however, without my knowledge; he has probed my memory and discovered my most sensitive point. How can I doubt it? Without any help, without any 'ray transmission', he broke through the hermetic armour, the double shell of the Station, found me and took his booty... - Kris? Standing at the window, staring, I didn't see the night coming. A thin ceiling of high clouds, a silver dome dimly reflecting the vanished sun, veiled the stars. If she disappears after the experience, it will mean that I wanted her gone. That I killed her. No, I will not go up to Sartorius. I don't have to obey them. What will I tell them? The truth? No. I can't tell them the truth. I will have to act, lie, again and again... Because there may be thoughts, intentions, cruel hopes in me of which I know nothing, because I am a murderer who does not know himself. Man has set out to discover other worlds, other civilizations, without having fully explored his own abyss, his labyrinth of dark corridors and secret chambers, without having penetrated the mystery of the doors he himself has condemned. Leave Harey to them... out of modesty? To abandon him only because I lack courage? - Kris," said Harey, even lower. She had come closer to me. I pretended not to have heard her. At that moment, I wanted to isolate myself. I had to isolate myself. I had not yet decided anything, made any resolution. I stood still, looking up at the black sky, at the cold stars, the pale ghosts of the stars that shone above the earth. My head was suddenly empty of all thought. All that remained was the dreary certainty that I had irretrievably crossed a border. Indifferent, I refused to know that I was on my way to the unattainable and I no longer had the strength to despise myself.
