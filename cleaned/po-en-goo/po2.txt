the tubular corridor was empty  i stood in front of the closed door for a while  listening  the walls must have been thin  and the wind howled from outside  there was a slightly slanted  sloppy rectangular piece of plaster on the door panel with the word  man  written in pencil  i stared at the scribbled word  i moved  and the unbearable weight of the suit bent my arms  quietly  as if hiding from an unseen observer  i returned to the circular room with five doors  there were signs on them  dr  gibarian  dr  snaut  dr  sartorius  there was none on the fourth one  i hesitated  then i pressed the handle lightly and opened it slowly  as it swung open  i had the almost certain feeling that someone was there  i went in  there was no one there  the same  only slightly smaller  convex window  looking out at the ocean that here   against the sun  it shone greasy  as if red oil had flowed from the waves  and the crimson glare filled the whole room  like a ships cabin  there were shelves with books  between them  strapped vertically to the wall  a bed was mounted on gimbals  on the other side there were many cupboards  between them hung on nickel frames aerial photographs glued together with strips  in metal holders flasks and test tubes plugged with cotton wool  under the window in two rows white enameled boxes were set up so that you could barely walk between them  some had their lids swung open   they were full of tools  plastic hoses  there were faucets in both corners  a smoke extractor  freezer cabinets  the microscope was on the floor  there was no room for it on the big table next to the window  when i turned around  just by the front door  i saw a ceiling high  open wardrobe full of coveralls  work and protective aprons  underwear on the shelves  aluminum bottles for portable oxygen machines gleaming between the tops of anti radiation shoes  two cameras with masks hung hooked to the rail of the raised bed  everywhere was the same  only roughly  as if in a hurry  sloppy orderly chaos  i inhaled the air exploratively  detected a faint chemical odor and a hint of a pungent odor   was it chlorine  instinctively  i searched with my eyes for the grilled air vents in the ceiling corners  strips of paper stuck to their frames fanned gently as a sign that the compressors were working  maintaining normal air circulation  i moved the books  cameras  and tools from the two chairs to the corners  stuffing them as much as i could until there was a relatively empty space around the bed between the wardrobe and the shelves  i pulled up the rack to hang the suit on  grabbed the zipper pulls in my fingers  then let go  somehow i couldnt decide to drop the suit  as if it would make me vulnerable  i took another look around the room  checked that the door was securely shut  and as there was no lock on it  after a brief hesitation i pushed the two heaviest boxes towards it  having barricaded myself so makeshiftly  with three jerks i freed myself from my heavy  creaking shell  a narrow mirror on the inner surface of the wardrobe reflected part of the room  out of the corner of my eye i caught a movement there  jumped up  but it was my own reflection  the leotard under the suit was sweaty  i dropped it and pushed the wardrobe  she stepped back  the walls of a miniature bathroom gleaming in the alcove behind her  there was a large  flat cassette on the floor under the ink  i carried her with difficulty to the room  as i placed it on the floor  the lid springed open  and i saw compartments filled with bizarre exhibits  tools caricatured or roughly sketched in dark metal  some analogous to those in the cupboards  they were all unusable  malformed  rounded  melted  as if taken from a fire  the strangest thing was that even the ceramic handles  which were practically infusible  had the same shape of damage  it is impossible to reach their incubation temperatures in any laboratory furnace   except inside an atomic pile  from the pocket of my draped suit i took a small ray tracer  but the black muzzle was silent as i held it close to the remains  i was only wearing briefs and a mesh t shirt  i threw both on the floor like rags and jumped naked under the ink  the rush of water felt like relief  i writhed under the downpour of hard  hot streams  massaging my body  snorting  all somehow exaggerated  as if shaking  spewing out all that muddy  contagious uncertainty that filled the station  i searched the closet for a light training suit that could also be worn under a suit  and pocketed all my meager possessions  between the pages of the notebook i felt something hard  it was the key to my earthly dwelling  i dont know how  which i turned in my fingers for a moment  not knowing what to do with it  i finally put it on the table  it occurred to me that i might need some kind of weapon  it certainly wasnt a universal penknife  but i didnt have anything else  and i wasnt in a state of mind yet to start looking for a ray thrower or anything like that  i sat on a metal chair in the middle of the empty space  away from all things  i wanted to be alone  i was pleased to find that i still had over half an hour of time  its hard  meticulousness in complying with all  no matter how important or insignificant  obligations is my nature  the hands on the twenty four hour dial stood at seven  the sun was setting  seven oclock local time was the twentieth of the prometheus deck  solaris must have shrunk to the size of a spark on moddards screens  no different from stars  but what could i care about prometheus  i closed my eyes  there was complete silence except for the meowing of the pipes at regular intervals  water trickled softly in the bathroom  dripping onto the china  gibarian was dead  if i understood what snaut was saying correctly  only a few hours have passed since his death  what did they do with the body  have they buried them  true  on this planet you couldnt do that  i thought about this matter of factly for a long time  as if the fate of the dead was the most important thing  until  realizing the nonsense of such thoughts  i got up and started walking diagonally across the room  nudging the scattered books with the tip of my foot  some small  empty duffel bag  i bent down and picked her up  it wasnt empty  it contained a bottle of dark glass  as light as if it had been blown out of paper  i looked through it at the window  at the darkly reddening last light of sunset  smoky with dirty mists  what was happening to me  why did i deal with any nonsense  any unimportant trifle that fell into my hands  i jumped as the light came on  of course  a photocell  sensitive to the approaching dusk  i was full of anticipation  the tension was building up to the point where i finally didnt want to have an empty space behind me  i decided to fight it  i pulled the chair up to the shelves  i pulled out the all too familiar second volume of hughes and eugels old monograph  historia solaris  and began to leaf through it  propping the thick  stiff spine on my knee  solaris was discovered nearly a century before i was born  the planet revolves around two suns  a red one  no ship had come close to it in over forty years  in those days  gamow shapleys theory of the impossibility of life on double star planets was taken for granted  the orbits of such planets are constantly changing due to the gravitational the resulting perturbations alternately contract and stretch the planets orbit  and the primordials of life  if they arise  are destroyed by radiant heat or icy cold  millions  if not billions of years    in a very short time  solaris had  according to the original by these calculations  in five hundred thousand years  to come within half an astronomical unit of its red sun  and after another million  to fall into its scorching abyss  but after a dozen or so years  it was discovered that its track did not show the expected changes  as if it were constant  as constant as the trajectories of the planets of our solar system  observations and calculations were repeated  now with the highest accuracy  which only confirmed what was known  that solaris has an unstable orbit  from one of several hundred planets discovered every year  which are included in great statistics with a few lines of notes detailing the elements of their motion  solaris then advanced to the rank of a body worthy of special attention  in fact  four years after this discovery  it was circled by otenskjolds expedition  which explored the planet from laocoon and two accompanying auxiliary ships  this expedition had the character of a makeshift  improvised reconnaissance  the more so that it was unable to land  it introduced into equatorial and polar orbits a greater number of automatic observer satellites  whose main task was to measure gravitational potentials  in addition  the surface of the planet  almost entirely covered by the ocean  and the few plateaus rising above its level were explored  their total area does not match the area of europe  although solaris is twenty percent larger than earth in diameter  these patches of rocky and desert land  scattered irregularly  are concentrated mainly in the southern hemisphere  they also determined the composition of the oxygen free atmosphere and made very precise measurements of the planets density  as well as albeda and other astronomical elements  as expected  no signs of life were found either on land or in the ocean  over the next ten years  solaris  now at the center of the attention of all observatories in the region  showed an astonishing tendency to maintain its gravitationally unstable orbit beyond any doubt  for some time the case smacked of scandal  because the blame for this result of observations was tried to be blamed  for the sake of the good of science  either on certain people or on the calculating machines they used  lack of funds delayed the actual launch of the solar expedition for another three years  until shannahan  having completed the crew  obtained three spaceport class c class vessels from the institute  a year and a half before the arrival of the expedition that launched from the area of alpha aquarius  the second exploration fleet  on behalf of the institute  launched the robotic satellite luna 247 into circumsolar orbit  this satellite  after three successive reconstructions  separated by decades  has been working to this day  the data he collected finally confirmed the observation of the otenskjold expedition about the active nature of the oceans movements  one of shannahans ships remained in high orbit  while two landed after preliminary preparations on a rocky patch of land that covers about six hundred square miles at the south pole of solaris  the expeditions work ended after eighteen months  proceeding successfully  except for one mishap caused by malfunctioning apparatus  within the scientific team  however  there was a split into two opposing camps  the subject of the dispute became the ocean  based on analyzes  it was recognized as an organic creation  nobody dared to call it alive at that time   however  when the biologists saw in it a primitive formation   a kind of gigantic assemblage  so as if one  monstrous in its growth  liquid cell  but they called it  prebiological formation    which surrounded the entire globe with a gelatinous mantle  with a depth of in places of several miles   astronomers and physicists argued that it must be an extremely highly organized structure  perhaps beating terrestrial organisms with the complexity of its construction  since it can actively influence the shaping of the planetary orbit  and  in addition  planetary physicists have discovered a connection between certain processes in the plasma ocean and the locally measured gravitational potential  which varied according to the oceans  metabolism   thus  physicists  not biologists  coined the paradoxical expression  plasma machine   meaning a creature  in our sense  perhaps not animate  but capable of undertaking deliberate actions on a   let us add at once   astronomical scale  attracted all the eminent authorities within weeks  the gamow shapley doctrine wavered for the first time in eighty years  for some time  attempts were made to defend it by claiming that the ocean had nothing to do with life  that it was not even a creation of  para   or  prebiological   but a geological formation  probably unusual  but capable only of perpetuating the orbit of solaris by changing the force of gravity  le chateliers rule was invoked  that the ocean is the result of a dialectical development  from its primordial form  from the primeval ocean  a solution of lazily reacting chemical under the pressure of conditions  that is  changes in its orbit that threaten its very existence   without the mediation of all terrestrial stages of development  so bypassing the origin of unicellular and multicellular organisms  vegetable and animal evolution  without the birth of the nervous system  the brain  jump immediately to the stage of  ocean homeostatic   in other words  it did not adapt like terrestrial organisms to the environment for hundreds of millions of years  only after such a huge time to give rise to a rational race  but it mastered its environment at once  it was not original at all  except that still no one knew how a syrupy jelly could stabilize the orbit of a celestial body  devices that created artificial force and gravitational fields   gravitors   had been known for almost a century  but no one had even imagined how the result  which in gravitors was the result of complex nuclear reactions and extreme temperatures  could be achieved by amorphous goo  the newspapers  then choked to the curiosity of readers and to the horror of scientists with the most indiscriminate inventions about the  secret of solaris   there were also such claims that the planetary ocean is     a distant relative of the earths electric eels  to unravel  it turned out that the explanation  as it often happened with solaris  replaced one puzzle with another  perhaps even more astonishing  can directly model the space time metric  which leads  among other things  to deviations in the measurement of time on one and the same solaris meridian so the ocean not only knew in a sense  but was even able  what can not be said about us  to use the consequences of the einstein boe theory with this said  one of the most violent storms of our time broke out in the scientific world  for centuries  the most venerable theories universally accepted as true were crumbling  the most heretical articles appeared in the scientific literature  and the alternatives  genius ocean  or  gravitational jelly  fired all minds  all this happened a good dozen years before i was born  when i was in school  solaris  due to the facts i learned later  was already universally recognized as a planet endowed with life   but with only one inhabitant     the second volume of hughes and eugel  which i still leafed through almost mindlessly  began with a systematic  as original as what a fun thought  the classification table presented in turn  type   polytheria  order   syncytialia  class   metamorpha  it was as if we knew god knows how many specimens of a species  when in fact there was still only one  albeit weighing seventeen trillion tons  colorful diagrams  color charts  analyzes and spectral spectra flew under my fingers  demonstrating the type and rate of the basic transformation and its chemical reactions  the further i delved into the bulky volume  the more math flitted through the chalky pages  one might have thought our knowledge of this metamorpha class who lay shrouded in the darkness of a four hour night several hundred meters below the stations steel floor was complete  in fact  not everyone was yet in agreement as to whether this was a  being   let alone whether the ocean could be called rational  i snapped the great volume on the shelf and brought out another  a summary of the experimental protocols of all those countless endeavors aimed at making contact with the ocean  the second part of the volume  almost 1 300 pages  was occupied only by the bibliography of the subject  the original literature would certainly not have fit in the room i was sitting in  the first attempts at contact were made through special electronic devices transforming stimuli  sent back and forth  and ocean took nudes along the way significant part in shaping these apparatuses  but all this happened in complete darkness  what did he mean by  participated   he modified certain elements of the devices that were immersed in it  so that the recorded rhythms of the discharges changed  the recording devices recorded a multitude of signals  as if they were shreds of some huge operation of higher analysis  but what did it all mean  the oceans momentary state of excitation  perhaps the impulses that gave rise to its enormous creations  somewhere  thousands of miles away  perhaps  translated into inscrutable electronic constructs  reflections of the eternal truths of this ocean  perhaps its works of art  who could know  since it was impossible to obtain two times the same reaction to a stimulus  when the response was once an explosion of impulses almost bursting the apparatus  and once a dead silence  since no experience was possible to repeat  it still seemed that we were one step away from deciphering this ever expanding sea of records  after all  it was for this purpose that electronic brains with processing power were built and information that no problem has ever required  indeed  some results have been obtained  the ocean   the source of electric  magnetic  gravitational impulses   spoke as if the language of mathematics  certain sequences of its current discharges could be classified by the most abstract branches of terrestrial analysis  set theory  and there appeared homologues of structures known from that branch of physics that deals with the relationship of energy and matter  finite and infinite quantities  particles and fields   all this led scientists to believe that they were facing a thinking monster  that it was a kind of millions of times larger  encircling the entire planet  protoplasmic sea brain  consuming time with amazing in its scope theoretical considerations about the essence of all things  and all this what our cameras pick up are tiny  accidentally overheard fragments of that gigantic monologue that goes on forever in the depths  beyond our comprehension  so many mathematicians  such hypotheses were described by some as an expression of disregard for human capabilities  as prostration before something we do not yet understand  but which can be understood as unearthing the old doctrine of  ignoramus et ignorabinius  from the grave  harmful and idle tales that in these hypotheses of mathematicians the mythology of our times manifests itself  seeing in a giant brain   electronic or plasma  it is all the same   the highest goal of existence   the summa of being  and others     but there were legions of researchers and views  well besides  it was a whole field of trying to  get in touch  compared to other branches of solaristics where specialization had gone so far  especially in the last quarter of a century  that the solarist cyberneticist could hardly communicate with the solarist simelriadologist   how can you communicate with the ocean if you cant communicate with each other anymore   asked veubeke  who was then  during my studies  the director of the institute  jokingly asked  there was a lot of truth in this joke  its undulating surface could give rise to the most different  unlike anything earthly forms  the purpose   adaptive  cognitive or whatever   of these sometimes violent eruptions of plasmic  creativity  was a complete mystery  as i put the volume  so heavy i had to hold it with both hands  on the shelf  i thought that our knowledge of solaris that fills libraries is a useless ballast and quagmire of facts  and we are in the same place where it began to be collected seventy eight years ago  in fact  the situation was much worse  because all the effort of those years turned out to be in vain  what we knew exactly consisted of nothing but denials  the ocean did not use or build machines  though it seemed able to do so under certain circumstances  for it duplicated parts of some of the apparatus submerged in it  but it did so only in the first and second years of exploration  then he ignored all repeated attempts with benedictine patience  as if he had lost all interest in our devices and products  and it would appear that also in us       it possessed   i continue the enumeration of our  negative news    no nervous system  no cells  no protein like structure  it did not always react to stimuli  even the most powerful ones  for example  it completely  ignored  the crash of gieses second expeditions auxiliary rocket ship  which crashed from a height of three hundred kilometers to the surface of the planet  destroying the plasma within a mile and a half with the nuclear explosion of their atomic piles   slowly  in the circles of scientists  the  solaris case  began to sound like a  lost cause   especially in the spheres of the institutes scientific administration  where voices have been raised in recent years demanding a cut in subsidies for further research  no one has dared to talk about the complete liquidation of the station  that would be too blatant an admission of defeat  anyway  some people said in private conversations that all we needed was a strategy of  honourable  withdrawal from the  solaris affair     but for many  especially the young  the  affair  gradually became something of a touchstone of self worth   in fact   they said   there is more at stake than the exploration of solarian civilization  for the game is about ourselves  on the limits of human knowledge  for a time the popular view  disseminated zealously by the daily press  was that the thinking ocean that flows over all of solaris was a gigantic brain  millions of years ahead of our civilization  that it was some sort of  cosmic yoga   a sage  a form of omniscience that it has already understood the futility of any action and therefore maintains categorical silence towards us   this was simply not true  because the living ocean works  and how else   only according to other than human ideas  it does not build cities or bridges or flying machines  nor does it try to conquer space or transcend it  some defenders of human superiority saw an invaluable asset for us at all costs   but deals with thousands of transformations    ontological auto metamorphosis   there is no shortage of learned terms on the pages of solaristic works  because  on the other hand  a man who stubbornly reads all possible solarians has an overwhelming impression that he has before him fragments of intellectual constructions  perhaps brilliant  intermixed without order and composition with the fruits of some complete folly bordering on madness  it arose as the antithesis of the concept of  ocean yoga  think of  ocean moron   these hypotheses brought from the grave and revived one of the oldest philosophical problems   the relation of matter and spirit  consciousness  it took a great deal of courage to for the first time  like du haart  attribute consciousness to the ocean  this problem  hastily recognized by methodologists as metaphysical  smoldered at the bottom of almost all discussions and disputes  is it possible to think without consciousness  but can the processes taking place in the ocean be called thinking  is the mountain a very large stone  is the planet a huge mountain  you can use these names  but the new size scale brings new regularities and new phenomena to the scene  this problem has become the square of the circle of our times  every independent thinker has tried to contribute to the treasury of solaristics  theories proliferated that we were facing a product of degeneration  of regression following the past phase of the oceans  intellectual splendour   that the ocean was in fact a glial tumor that  having been born within the bodies of the planets former inhabitants    devoured them all and devoured them  fusing the remains into an everlasting  self rejuvenating  supracellular element in the white  earth like fluorescent light  i took the cameras and books from the table  spread the map of solaris on a plastic plate  and looked into it  resting his hands on the metal strips at the edges  the living ocean had its shallows and depths  its islands  tarnished with weathering minerals  testified that they had once been its bottom   did it also regulate the rise and fall of rock formations  submerged in my womb  it was completely dark  knowing  i dont know for the first time in my life  an astonishment as shocking as the first one i experienced when  as a boy  i learned at school about the existence of solaris  i dont know how it happened that the surroundings with the mystery of gibarians death that lingered in them  that even my unknown future seemed unimportant to me  and i thought of nothing  lost in the study of this terrifying map for every man  the individual patches of life were named after the researchers who devoted themselves to their exploration  i was staring at the thexalla gleymass flowing around the equatorial archipelagos when i felt someones gaze  i was still standing over the map  but i couldnt see it anymore  i was paralyzed  the door was right in front of me  they were piled with boxes and a cupboard pushed up to them  its some sort of automaton  i thought  although there had never been one in the room before  and it couldnt have come in unnoticed by me  the skin on the back of my neck and back was beginning to sting  the feeling of heavy  fixed gaze becoming unbearable  i didnt realize that as i pulled my head into my arms  i leaned more and more against the table  which began to slide slowly across the floor  this movement seemed to set me free  i turned sharply  the room was empty  in front of me there was only blackness of a great semi circular window  the impression did not go away  the darkness stared at me  formless  vast  eyeless  borderless  not a single star illuminated the darkness beyond the windows  i drew the lightproof curtains  i hadnt even been to the station for an hour  and i was beginning to understand why there were cases of persecution mania there  i connected it instinctively with gibarians death  knowing him  i had thought that nothing could disturb his mind  im no longer sure  i was standing in the middle of the room next to the table  my breathing slowed down and i felt the sweat that had formed on my forehead cool down  what did i just think about  the truth   about slot machines  the fact that i did not encounter any in the corridor or in the rooms was very strange  where have they all gone  the only one i came across   remotely   was for the mechanical maintenance of the airport  and others  i looked at my watch  actually  i should go to snauts now  i left  the corridor was dimly lit by fluorescent lamps running from the ceiling  i passed two doors until i came to the one with gibarians name on it  i stood in front of them for a long time  silence filled the station  i took the handle  i didnt really want to go in there at all  it buckled  the door slid back an inch  a crack  black for a moment  then a light came on  now anyone walking down the hall could see me  i quickly crossed the threshold and closed the door behind me  soundlessly and firmly  then i turned around  i was standing with my back almost touching the door  it was a room larger than mine  also with a panoramic window  three quarters covered with a curtain  undoubtedly brought from earth  not belonging to the stations equipment  with small blue and pink flowers  library shelves and cabinets lined the walls  both enamelled a very pale green with a silvery sheen  their contents  piled on the floor in heaps  were piled up between stools and armchairs  directly in front of me  two walking tables stood in front of me  toppled and embedded partly in the piles of magazines that tore from cracked folders  the open  fanning books were flooded with liquids from broken flasks and bottles with worn in stoppers  most of them so thick walled that a simple fall to the floor  even from a considerable height  would not have shattered them  under the window lay an overturned desk with a broken work lamp on its reach arm  a stool lay in front of him  its two legs digging into the half drawn drawers  a veritable flood of sheets  handwritten sheets  papers covered the entire floor  i recognized gibarians handwriting and bent over them  picking up the loose sheets  i noticed that my hand casts not a single shadow  but a double one  i turned around  the pink curtain blazed as if lit at the top  a sharp line of fierce blue fire that expanded with each passing moment  i yanked the fabric to the side   eyes burned with a terrible fire  it occupied a third of the horizon  a thicket of long  eeriely stretched shadows ran along the hollows of the waves towards the station  it was east  in the zone where the station was located  the second blue sun of the planet entered the sky after an hour of night  the circuit breaker turned off the ceiling lights as i returned to the abandoned papers  i came across a succinct description of an experiment designed three weeks ago   gibarian intended to expose plasma to very hard x rays  i saw from the text that it was intended for sartorius  who was to organize the experiment   i had a copy in my hand  the white sheets of paper were beginning to annoy me  the day that came was different from the previous one  under the orange sky of the cooling sun  the ocean  inky with bloody gleams  was almost always covered with a dusty pink mist  melting the vault  the clouds  the waves   all of that was gone now  even the light  filtered through the pink fabric  burned like the burner of a powerful quartz lamp  the tan of my hands turned almost gray in it  the whole room changed  everything that had had a red tint turned brown and faded to the color of liver  while the white  green  and yellow objects became sharper in color that they seemed to radiate a glow of their own  squinting  i peered through a slit in the curtain  the sky was a white sea of fire  beneath which it trembled and quivered as if molten metal  i squeezed my eyes shut  red circles widening in my vision  on the console of the washbasin  its edge was shattered  i uncovered dark glasses that covered almost half of my face and put them on  the window curtain now burned like a sodium flame  i continued reading  picking up the sheets from the ground and placing them on the only unturned table  some text was missing  there were reports of experiments already carried out  i learned from them that they had irradiated the ocean for four days at a point fourteen hundred miles northeast of its present location  all this took me by surprise  because the use of x rays was prohibited by the un convention because of their deadly effects  and i was quite sure that no one had asked the earth for permission for these experiments  at one point  raising my head  i saw my own reflection in the mirror of the open wardrobe door  a deathly white face with black glasses  the room was eerie  blazing with white and blue  but after a few minutes there was a prolonged grinding sound  and airtight flaps closed on the windows from the outside  the interior darkened and an artificial light came on  strangely pale now  it just got warmer until the steady tone coming from the air conditioning ducts was like a strained whimper  the stations refrigeration equipment worked at full capacity  even so  the dead heat continued to rise  footsteps came to me  someone was walking down the corridor  in two soundless steps i was at the door  the footsteps slowed and stopped  the one who walked stood outside the door  the handle slowly bent  without thinking  i instinctively grabbed it from my side and held it  the pressure did not increase  but it did not decrease either  the person on the other side of the door was just as silent  as if surprised  we held the doorknob for a good while  then it snapped back suddenly in my hand   let loose  and a faint rustle told me it was leaving  i was still listening  but there was silence
