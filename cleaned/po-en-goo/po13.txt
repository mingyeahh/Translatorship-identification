the next three weeks were like one and the same day  repeating itself over and over again  window covers going up and down  at night i crawled from one nightmare to another  in the morning we would get up and the game would start  but was it a game  i feigned calm and   feigned it  that tacit understanding  the knowledge of each others deception  became our last refuge  because we talked a lot about how we would live on earth  how we would settle somewhere near a big city and never leave the blue sky and green trees again  and we thought up the interior of our future house and garden together  and we even argued about the details    about the hedge  about the bench    did i believe it for a second  no  i knew it was impossible  i knew about it  because even if she could leave the station   alive   only a man can land on earth  and a man is his papers  the first check would end this escape  theyd try to identify her  so theyd disconnect us first  and that would betray her immediately  the station was the only place we could live together  did harry know about this  definitely  did someone tell her that  in light of everything thats happened  i guess so  one night i heard   get up quietly in my sleep  i wanted to hug her  only by being silent  only in the darkness  could we become free for a while  in a lostness that the despair surrounding us made only a momentary suspension of the torture  she didnt seem to notice that i woke up  by the time i reached out  she was off the bed  i heard   still only half awake   the sound of bare feet  a vague fear gripped me       i whispered  i wanted to scream  but i didnt dare  i sat on the bed  the door leading to the corridor was only closed  a thin needle of light slanted across the cabin  i thought i heard muffled voices  was she talking to someone  with whom  i jumped out of bed  but such terrible fear seized me that my legs refused to obey me  i stood listening for a while   it was quiet  i slowly dragged myself to bed  pulse pounded in his head  i started counting  at 1 000 i stopped  the door swung open noiselessly    slid inside and stood still  as if listening to my breathing  i tried to make it measured    chris     she whispered softly  i didnt answer  she slid quickly into bed  i felt her stretched out and lay beside her  limp for i dont know how long  i tried to structure the questions  but the more time passed  the more i understood that i would not speak first  after a while  maybe an hour later  i fell asleep  the morning was the same as always  i only eyed her suspiciously when she couldnt see it  after dinner  we sat side by side in front of the curved window  through which low  red clouds floated  the station glided among them like a ship    was reading a book  and i was in one of those obsessions that so often became the only respite now  i noticed that by tilting my head in a certain way  i could see both of us reflected in the glass  clear but clear  i took my hand off the railing      i saw it in the glass   after making sure with a quick glance that i was looking at the ocean  she leaned over the railing and touched her lips to it where i had just touched  i sat on  unnaturally stiff  and she bent her head over the book       i said softly   where did you go out last night     in the night    yes    something    you dreamed     i never went out    didnt you go out    no  you must have dreamed it   maybe   i said    yes  its possible that i dreamed     in the evening  when we were already lying down  i started talking about our journey again  about returning to earth   ah  i dont want to hear about it   she said    dont talk     you know      what    nothing  nothing  when we were lying down  she said she was thirsty    there  on the table  there is a glass of juice  please pass it to me  she drank half of it and handed it to me  i had no desire to drink   for my health   she smiled  i drank the juice  which i thought was a little salty  but i didnt notice it   if you dont want us to talk about earth  then what   i asked as she turned off the light    would you get married if i wasnt there    no    never    never    why    i do not know  ive been single for ten years and not married  lets not talk about it  honey    my head was buzzing like id drunk at least a bottle of wine    no  lets talk  lets just talk  what if i asked you    for me to get married  nonsense  harry  i dont need anyone but you  she bent over me  i felt her breath on my lips  she hugged me so tightly that the inexhaustible drowsiness that had gripped me receded for a moment    say it differently    i love you  she bumped her forehead against my shoulder  and i felt her tense eyelids twitch and her tears wet    harley  whats up    nothing  nothing  nothing  she repeated more and more quietly  i tried to open my eyes  but they kept closing on their own  i dont know when i fell asleep  a red dawn woke me up  my head was lead and my neck was stiff  as if all the vertebrae had fused into one bone  i couldnt move my rough  nasty tongue in my mouth  i must have poisoned myself with something  i thought  lifting my head with an effort  i reached out to    she landed on a cold sheet  i jumped up  the bed was empty  in the cabin   no one  the reflections of the suns disk repeated themselves in red discs in the panes  i jumped to the floor  i must have looked ridiculous because i staggered drunk  i grabbed the equipment  i got to the wardrobe   the bathroom was empty  the corridor too  and there was no one in the studio    harry    i shouted in the middle of the corridor  rowing my hands unconsciously         i croaked once more  already knowing  i dont remember exactly what happened next  i had to run  half naked  all over the station  i remember even falling into the cold store  and then into the last warehouse  and pounding on the sliding door with my fists  maybe even been there a few times  the stairs rumbled  i tumbled  jumped  ran somewhere again  until i reached a transparent barrier  behind which there is an exit to the outside  double armored doors  i pushed it with all my might and screamed for it to be a dream  and someone had been with me for some time and was pulling me  dragging me somewhere  then i was in the little study  shirt wet from icy water  hair matted  nostrils and tongue stinging with alcohol  half lying  panting  on something cold  metal  and   in his stained linen trousers bustling about the medicine cabinet  knocking over something that tools and glasses made a terrible noise  suddenly i saw him in front of me  looking into my eyes  attentive  stooped    where she is    shes not here   but  but          is gone   he said slowly  distinctly  bringing his face closer to mine as if he had struck me a blow  and now he was watching the effect   hell be back     i whispered  closing my eyes  and for the first time  i wasnt really afraid of it  i had no fear of the spectral return  i didnt understand how i could ever be afraid of him    drink it  he handed me a glass of warm liquid  i looked at it and all of a sudden threw it in his face  he stepped back  wiping his eyes  when he opened them  i was standing over him  he was so small    its you     what are you talking about    dont lie  you know what  were you the one who spoke to her that night  and you told her to give her a sleeping pill for this     what have you done with her   speak    he searched his breasts  he took out a crumpled envelope  i snatched it from him  it was sealed  nothing on top  i tore the paper  a piece of paper folded in four fell out  large  somewhat childish handwriting in uneven rows  i met them   honey  i was the first one to ask him  he is good  im sorry i had to lie to you  there was no other way  you can do one thing for me   listen to him and do nothing to yourself  you were great   underneath was one word crossed out i could read it      she wrote  then she blurred it out  there was another letter like h or k turned into a blur  i read it again and again  and yet  i was too sober to be hysterical  i couldnt even groan or make a sound    how  i whispered    how    then     hold on    im holding on  speak  how    annihilation    how is it  but camera     it hit me    roches camera was useless  sarto rius has built another special destabilizer  small  it only works within a few meters    what about her       shes gone  flash and blast  weak gust  nothing more    within a small radius  you say    yes  there was no material for the big one  suddenly the walls began to collapse on me  i closed my eyes    god    shes    shell be back  shell be back      no    its not       no     remember those rising foams  they havent come back since then    not any more    no   you killed her   i said quietly    yes  you wouldnt do it  on my place  i got up and started walking faster and faster  from the wall to the corner and back  nine steps  return  nine steps  i stood in front of him    listen  well file a report  we will request direct communication with the council  it can be done  theyll agree  they must  the planet will be excluded from the convention of the four  all means allowed  well bring in the antimatter generators  you think theres anything that can resist antimatter  there is nothing  nothing  nothing  i shouted triumphantly  blind from tears    do you want to destroy it    he said    for what    get out  leave me    i will not go       i looked him in the eye   no   he nodded   what do you want  what do you want from me   he stepped back to the table   okay  well report   second  our demands    now do we have to talk about it    yes  now    i dont want to  understand  i dont care    you wont stop   i grabbed his arm   you can hit me   he said   but ill keep talking  i let him go    do whatever you want    its just that   will try to hide certain facts  i am almost certain of it    and you dont    no  not now  its not just our business  its all about  you know what it is  hes been acting intelligently  a capacity for organic synthesis of the highest order that we dont know  he knows structure  microstructure  the metabolism of our bodies     okay   i said   why did you stop talking  he did it on us   series    series    of experiences  psychic vivisection  based on knowledge stolen from our heads  regardless of what we strive for   its not facts or even conclusions anymore     these are hypotheses  in a way  he cared about what some closed  hidden part of our minds wanted  it could have been   gifts      gifts  great god  i started laughing   stop it   he shouted  grabbing my hand  i squeezed his fingers  i squeezed harder and harder until my knuckles cracked  he stared at me with narrowed eyes  unmoving  i let him go and went to the corner  facing the wall  i said   ill try not to get hysterical     never mind all that  what will we demand    you tell  i cant now  did she say anything before       no  nothing  as for me  i think now is the chance    chance  what chance  for what  ah       i said more quietly  looking into his eyes  because i suddenly understood    contact  contact again  we dont have much left   and you  you  and this whole madhouse    contact  no no no  without me    why  he asked quite calmly       you still  and now more than ever  instinctively treat him as a human being  you hate him    and you do not       i threw    no     hes blind      blind  i repeated  not sure if i heard right    of course  in our understanding  we do not exist for him as we do for each other  the surface of the face and body that we see makes us get to know each other as individuals  this is a transparent glass for him  after all  it penetrated inside our brains    so good  so what  what are you going to  if he could animate  create a man who doesnt exist beyond my memory  so that her eyes  her movements  her voice    her voice     keep talking   keep talking  you hear      i say    i say    yes  so    the voice    it follows that it can read us like a book  you know what i want to say    yes  that if he wanted to  he could communicate with us    naturally  isnt it obvious    no  not at all  after all  he could only take a production prescription that does not consist of words  as a fixed memory record  it is a protein structure  like a sperm head or an egg  after all  there are no words or feelings in the brain  the memory of a person is an image written in the language of nucleic acids on large molecular asynchronous crystals  so he took what was apparently etched in us  the most closed  the fullest  the most deeply imprinted  you understand  but he didnt need to know what it meant to us  what it meant  its like we can create a symmetriad and throw it into the ocean  knowing the architecture  technology and building materials  but not understanding what its for  what its for  what it means to him     its possible   i said    yes  its possible  in that case  he didnt    maybe he didnt want to step on us like that and crush us  may be  and just unintentionally    my mouth started to fly         yes yes  okay  nothing  you are good  he too  everyone is good  but why  explain to me  why  did he do it for something  what did you say to her    truth    truth  truth  what    but you know  come to me now  we will write a report  come on    wait  what do you actually want  youre not going to stay at the station  are you      i want to stay  yes
