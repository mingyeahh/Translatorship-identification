i carried out my calculations with a kind of silent ferocity  and it was the only thing that kept me on my feet  i was so numb with fatigue that i could not extend the bed in the cabin  and instead of releasing the upper handles  i pulled on the railing until all the sheets fell on me  when i left them at last  i threw my clothes and linen on the floor  then fell semiconscious on the pillow  i didnt even push it properly  i fell asleep by the light  i dont know when  when i opened my eyes  i had the impression that i had only been asleep for a few minutes  the room stood in a cloudy red glow  i was cool and good  i was naked  uncovered  opposite the bed  under the half open window  someone was sitting in a chair in the light of the red sun  it was    in a white beach dress  her legs crossed  barefoot  dark hair slicked back  the thin material stretching across her breasts  her tanned arms down to her elbows  she stared fixedly at me from under her black lashes  i looked at her for a long time  quite calmly  my first thought was  how good it is that this is a dream where you know youre dreaming  still  i wish it would disappear  i closed my eyes and wished it very intensely  but when i opened them  the same as before  her lips were folded in her way  as if to whistle  but there was nothing like a smile in her eyes  i remembered everything i had thought about dreams the night before before falling asleep  she looked exactly as she had when i the last time he saw her alive  and she was nineteen then  she would have to be twenty nine now  but of course nothing has changed   the dead stay young  she had the same wondering eyes and looked at me  ill throw something at her  i thought  but though it was only a dream  i couldnt bring myself to throw things at the dead woman even in a dream    poor little girl   i said   you came to see me  didnt you  i was a little scared  because my voice sounded so real and my whole p oj and     everything was as real as you can imagine  what a vivid dream  almost colorful  i see a lot of things here on the floor that i didnt even notice yesterday when i went to bed  when i wake up  i thought  ill have to check if theyre really lying there  or if theyre just a figment of a dream like        how long are you going to sit like this     i asked and noticed that i was speaking softly  as if i was afraid someone would hear me  as if someone might overhear what was going on in the dream  meanwhile  the sun had already risen a little  well  i thought  good and that  i lay down during a red day  then it should be blue  then only the second red day  since i couldnt sleep for fifteen hours straight  its definitely a dream  reassured  i took a good look at    it was lit from behind  the ray passing through the slit of the curtain gilded the velvet down on her left cheek  and her eyelashes cast a long shadow on her face  she was lovely  please  i thought  how scrupulous i am even when im not awake  i keep an eye on the movement of the sun and that it has that dimple where no one else has it  below the corner of surprised lips  but i wish it would end  i have to get some work done  and i squeezed my eyes shut  trying to wake up  when all of a sudden i heard a creak  i opened my eyes immediately  she sat next to me on the bed and looked at me seriously  i smiled at her and she smiled and leaned over me  the first kiss was light  as if we were two children  i kissed her for a long time  can sleep be used like this    i thought  but this is not even a betrayal of her memory  because it is she who i dream about  herself  its never happened to me before    we still didnt say anything  i was lying on my back  when she lifted her face  i could see into her little nostrils  shone by the sun  which were always a barometer of her feelings  with my fingertips i guided her ear conchas  the petals of which were pink from kisses  i dont know if that alarmed me that much  i kept telling myself it was a dream  but my heart sank  i gathered myself to jump out of bed  i was prepared for the fact that i would fail  in dreams one often does not control ones own body  which is as if paralyzed or absent  i rather hoped to wake up from this intention  i didnt wake up though  just sat down with my legs down on the floor  theres no way  i have to dream it to the end   i thought  but the good mood disappeared without a trace  i was afraid    what do you want  i asked  my voice was hoarse and i had to clear my throat  i instinctively fumbled for my shoes with my bare feet  and before i remembered that i had no slippers here  i hit my toe so hard that i hissed  well  now it will be over  i thought with satisfaction  but still nothing happened    stepped back as i sat down  she leaned her back against the bed rail  her dress quivered slightly just below the tip of her left breast  to the rhythm of her beating heart  she looked at me with calm interest  i thought it would be best to take a shower  but the reflection came that a shower that is dreaming cannot wake you up    where did you come from  i asked  she lifted my hand and began to toss it in the old fashion  clasping my fingertips and grabbing them   i dont know   she said   is it bad   and the voice was the same  low  and absent minded  she always spoke as if she didnt care much about what she said  as if she was already occupied with something else  which made her seem sometimes thoughtless and sometimes shameless  because she watched everything with a subdued surprise that showed only in her eyes    has anyone seen you    i do not know  i just came  does it matter  chris  she continued to play with my hand  but her face was no longer involved  she frowned    harry       what  sweet    how did you know where i am  it made her wonder  in her smile   her lips were so dark that when she ate the cherries you couldnt tell   she showed the tips of her teeth    i have no idea  its funny  isnt it  you were asleep when i came in  but i didnt wake you up  i didnt want to wake you up because youre a bad boy  a mean and a bore  she tossed my hand more vigorously to the rhythm of these words    have you been downstairs    i was  i escaped from there  its cold there  she released my hand  lying on her side  she threw her head back so that all her hair fell to one side  and she looked at me with that half smile that only stopped irritating me when i fell in love with her   but         but     i stammered  i leaned over her and lifted the short sleeve of her dress  just above the flower like mark of the smallpox vaccination  a tiny puncture mark was red  although i expected it  because i was still quite reflexively looking for scraps of logic in impossibilities    i felt sick  i touched my finger that morning after the injection  which i dreamed for years afterwards  that i woke up moaning on the tattered sheets  always in the same pose  almost doubled up as she lay when i found her almost cold   because i tried in my sleep do what she did  as if i wanted to propitiate her memory or accompany her in those last minutes when she felt the effects of the injection and must have been afraid  she was afraid of even a simple cut  she could never bear the pain or the sight of blood  and all of a sudden she did such a terrible thing by leaving five words on a note addressed to me  i had it in my papers  i carried it with me all the time  threadbare  falling apart along the folds  i didnt have the courage to part with it   i returned thousands of times to the moment when she wrote it and to what she must have felt then  i told myself that she was just trying to fake it and scare me  but the dose turned out to be   unintentionally   too great  everyone convinced me that it was  or that it must have been a decision of the moment  caused by depression  sudden depression  but they didnt know what i had told her five days before  and so as to hurt her most severely  i took my things  and when i was packing she said very calmly   do you know what it means        and i pretended that i didnt understand  although i did  but i thought she was a coward and i told her that too   and now she was lying across the bed looking at me intently as if she didnt know i had killed her  the room was red from the sun  her hair was smoldering with dawn  she looked down at her own arm  it became important all of a sudden from having stared at it for so long  and when i lowered my hand she laid a cool  smooth cheek on it  it cant be    stop it   her eyes were closed  i could see them twitch under her strained lids  her black lashes touching her cheeks   where are we       with us    where is it   her eye opened for a second and then closed again  she tickled my hand with her eyelashes        what    im fine  si i stared at her without moving  i looked up and saw part of the bed   s messy hair  and my bare knees in the mirror over the sink  i kicked one of the half melted tools that were strewn across the floor with my foot and picked it up with my free hand  the end was sharp  i put it on the skin  just above the pink  semi circular  symmetrical scar  and drove it into the flesh  the pain was severe  i stared at the dripping blood that rolled in large droplets down the inside of my thigh  dripping silently onto the floor  it was futile  the terrible thoughts that ran through my mind became more and more clear  i no longer said to myself  this is a dream   i stopped believing in it a long time ago  now i thought  i have to defend myself   i looked at her back  passing under the white fabric into the curve of her hips  her bare feet dangling off the floor  i reached out  took her pink heel lightly  and ran my fingers along the sole of her foot  she was as delicate as a newborn  i knew almost for sure that it wasnt     and almost completely   that she didnt know it herself  a bare foot moved in my hand   s dark lips swelled with laughter without uttering a sound   stop     she whispered  i gently released my hand and stood up  i was still naked  dressing hastily  i saw her sit up on the bed  she was looking at me    where are your things  i asked and immediately regretted it    my stuff    what  you only have this dress  it was a game now  i tried to be deliberately nonchalant  casual  as if we had parted yesterday  no  as if we had never parted at all  she stood up and  with a light and firm movement i knew  tossed her skirt to straighten it  my words intrigued her  though she said nothing  she took in her surroundings with a matter of fact  searching gaze for the first time  and returned to me clearly surprised    i dont know       she said helplessly   probably in the closet        she added and opened the door ajar    no  there are only overalls there   i replied  i found an electric apparatus next to the washroom and began to shave  to the girl  whoever she was  she walked around the cabin  looked in all corners  looked out the window  and finally came up to me and said      do i feel like something happened   as if id forgotten something    as if id forgotten a lot  i know    i only remember you    and    and nothing else   you can call it that  yes  you were a little sick for a while    aha  it must have been that  she had cleared up already  i cant tell you what i was going through  when she was silent  she walked  sat down  smiled  the conviction that i had before me    it was stronger than my nauseating fear  then again  just like that moment  it seemed to me this is   simplified  narrowed down to a few characteristic statements  gestures and movements  she came quite close to me  pressed her clenched fists into my chest under my neck  and asked   how are we   good or bad   for the best   i replied  she smiled slightly    when you say that  its rather bad   no way    darling  i have to leave now   i said hastily    youll wait for me  okay  or maybe    are you hungry    i added  because i myself felt a growing hunger all at once    hungry  no  she shook her head  making her hair wave    should i wait for you  long   an hour   i began  but she cut me off   ill go with you     you cant come with me because i have to work    i will go with you  this was a completely different    the other one was unobtrusive  never   child  its impossible     she looked down at me  suddenly took my hand  i ran my hand up her forearm  her arm was full and warm  i didnt want it at all  but it was almost a caress  my body admitted to her  wanted her  drew me to her beyond reason  beyond argument and fear  trying to stay calm at all costs  i repeated      its impossible  you have to stay here     no  how it sounded    why    i    i dont know  she looked around and looked up at me again   i cant     she said quite quietly    but why     i do not know  i cant  i think    i think    she was clearly looking for an answer within herself  and when she found it  it was a revelation    it seems that i must still     see you  the matter of fact intonation took away from these words the meaning of a confession of feelings  it was something completely different  so impressed was the grip with which i was around her suddenly changed   though outwardly nothing had changed   she stood in my arms  looking into her eyes  i began to bend her arms back  this movement  not entirely determined at first  was already leading somewhere   it had found its purpose  i was looking for something to bind her with  her elbows  twisted back  tapped lightly against each other and at the same time flexed with a force that rendered my grip futile  i struggled for maybe a second  even an athlete bent back like    his toes barely touching the floor  couldnt free himself  but she  with a face that didnt take part in it all  smiling faintly  uncertainly  broke my hold  straightened up  and dropped her arms  her eyes watched me with the same calm interest they had at the beginning when i awoke  as if she was unaware of my desperate effort a moment ago  dictated by an attack of fear  she was now passive and waiting as if for something   at the same time indifferent  focused and a little surprised by all this  my hands fell off on their own  i left it in the middle of the room and went to the shelf by the sink  i felt that i was caught in an unimaginable trap  and i searched for a way out  contemplating increasingly ruthless ways  if someone had asked me what was happening to me and what it all meant  i wouldnt have been able to utter a word  but i was already realizing that what was happening to all of us on the station was a whole  as terrible as it was incomprehensible  not but that was what i was thinking at the moment  for i was trying to find some trick  some pull to escape  without looking  i could feel  s eyes on me  above the shelf was a small handy first aid kit in the wall  i skimmed through its contents  i found a jar of sleeping pills and dropped four pills   the maximum dose   into a glass  i wasnt even hiding my manipulations from    its hard to say why  i didnt think about it  i poured a glass of hot water  waited for the powders to dissolve  and walked over to    who was still standing in the center of the room    you are angry  she asked quietly    no  drink it  i dont know why i assumed he would listen to me  indeed  without a word  she took the glass from my hands and drank the entire contents in a gulp  i put my empty glass on the coffee table and sat in the corner between the wardrobe and the library shelf    walked slowly over to me and sat on the floor by the chair  as she often did  hunching her legs under her  and tossed her hair back in the same familiar motion  even though i no longer believed it was her  every time i recognized her in those little habits  something caught my throat  it was incomprehensible and terrible  and the most terrible thing was that i had to behave perversely myself  pretending that i took her for    but she thought she was   herself and did not act deceitfully in her understanding  i dont know how i came to the conclusion that this is so  but it was certain to me  if there could be anything certain at all  i sat and the girl leaned her back against my knees  her hair tickling my immobile hand  we stood there almost motionless  i glanced slightly at my watch a couple of times  half an hour had passed and the sleeping pill should have taken effect  harry murmured something softly    what are you saying  i asked  but she didnt answer  i took it as a sign of growing drowsiness  though god and the truth  deep down i doubted that the medicine would work  why  and i dont find an answer to this question  most likely because my subterfuge was already too simple  slowly her head sank down to my lap  her dark hair covered her completely  she breathed steadily like a sleeping man  i bent down to carry her to the bed  and all of a sudden  without opening her eyes  she grabbed my hair lightly with her hand and burst into a sharp laugh  i was numb  and she was beaming with merriment  her eyes narrowed into slits  she looked at me with an expression that was both naive and sly  i sat unnaturally stiff  dumbfounded and helpless  and   giggled again  pressed her face against my hand  and fell silent    why are you laughing  i asked in a wooden voice  the same expression of a little uneasy thought appeared on her face  i saw that she wanted to be honest  she tapped her little nose with her finger and finally said with a sigh   i dont know   it sounded genuinely surprised    im acting like an idiot  arent i  she said    i feel so suddenly     but youre also good  you sit bloated like     like pelvis       like who  i asked  because i thought i had heard wrong   like pelvis  you know  the fat    well    beyond any doubt could not have known pelvis or heard about him from me  for the simple reason that he returned from his trip a good three years after her death  i didnt know him either until then  and i didnt know that when chairing the meetings of the institute  he had an intolerable habit of protracting meetings indefinitely  his name was pelle villis  which was an abbreviated nickname  also unknown before his return    rested her elbows on my knees and looked me in the face  i placed my hands on her shoulders and moved them slowly up to her shoulders until they almost touched the throbbing  bare shoulder of her neck  it might have been a caress after all  and from the look in her eyes  she didnt understand it otherwise  in fact  i was convinced that her body was touched by ordinary  warm human flesh  and that bones and joints were hidden beneath the muscles  looking into her calm eyes  i felt a terrible urge to clench my fingers violently  they were about to close when i suddenly remembered  s bloodied hands and released her   how are you looking     she said calmly  my heart was pounding so hard i couldnt speak  i closed my eyes for a moment  all at once the whole plan of action appeared to me  from beginning to end  in all its details  without wasting a second  i got up from my chair   i have to go now      i said   and if you must  come with me     okay  she jumped to her feet    why are you barefoot  i asked as i walked over to the closet and picked out two of the colorful jumpsuits  one for me and one for her   i dont know    i must have thrown my shoes somewhere     she said uncertainly  i let it go past my ears    you cant wear it in a dress  youll have to take it off    dungarees     what for  she asked  starting at once to take off her dress  but at once something strange appeared  that it was impossible to take it off  because it had no fastener  the red buttons in the center were an ornament  there was no zipper  zip or otherwise  harley smiled confusedly  pretending it was the most ordinary thing in the world  lifted from the ground  like a scalpel  i cut the material where the back of the neckline ended  now she could pull the dress over her head  the suit was a bit too big for her    will we     but so are you  she inquired as we left the room  already dressed  i just nodded  i was terribly afraid of meeting    but the corridor leading to the airport was empty and the door of the radio station  which we had to pass  was closed  there was still dead silence in the station    watched as i rolled the rocket out of the center box onto the free track in a small electric cart  i checked the condition of the microreactor  the remote controls  and the nozzles one by one  and then  together with the launch cart  rolled the missile onto the circular roller plane of the launch pad under the central funnel of the dome  first removing the empty pod from there  it was a communication craft between the station and the satellite  used to carry cargo  not people  except in exceptional cases  since it could not be opened from the inside  that was what suited me and was part of the plan  i didnt intend to launch the rocket naturally  but i did everything as if i was preparing it for a real launch     who had accompanied me on many trips  knew a bit about this  i checked the condition of the air conditioning and oxygen equipment inside  turned them on and off  and when the lights came on after turning on the main circuit  i climbed out of the cramped space and pointed them at    who was standing by the ladder    come inside    and you    ill follow you  i have to close the hatch behind us  i didnt think she could see through the ruse prematurely  when she climbed the ladder inside  i immediately poked my head through the opening and asked if she could make herself comfortable  and when i heard a dull  choked  yes  i stepped back and slammed the hatch shut  i began to tighten the five screws holding it in the grooves of the armor the sharpened cigar stood upright  as if it were about to fly into space i knew that nothing bad would happen to the one inside it   there was enough oxygen in the rocket and even some food  not at all i was going to imprison her there indefinitely  i wanted at least a few hours of freedom to make plans for the future and contact    now on an equal footing  as i tightened the penultimate screw  i felt racket  suspended only by protrusions on three sides  trembles slightly  but i thought it was myself  working with with a swing with a large wrench  i unintentionally swung the steel block  but when i walked a few steps away  i saw something i would never want to see again  the entire racket shuddered as it was tossed about by a series of blows from within  but what blows  if the place of the black haired  slender girl in the ship was taken by a steel automaton  it certainly wouldnt be able to make the eight ton mass tremble so convulsively  the reflections of the airport lights in its polished surface shimmered and trembled  i didnt hear any strikes anyway  there was absolute silence inside the projectile  only the widely spaced feet of the scaffolding where the racket hung lost their sharpness  quivering like strings  the frequency of these vibrations was such that i was scared for the whole armor  i tightened the last bolt with shaking hands  threw down the wrench  and jumped off the ladder  reversing slowly  i saw the bolts of the shock absorbers  designed only for constant pressure  dancing in their sockets  it seemed to me that the armored coating was losing its uniform glow  i jumped frantically to the remote control panel  and with both hands pushed up the reactor start up and communication levers  then from the loudspeaker  which was connected to the inside of the rocket  came a piercing whine  half whiz  quite unlike a human voice  and yet i made out a repeated  howling             i couldnt hear it clearly anyway  blood was flowing from my broken knuckles  i was trying so chaotically and violently to launch the projectile  there was a high  drawn out rumble  the rocket rose on three flames that immediately coalesced into a single column of fire  and  leaving behind shivering sheets of embers  it flew out through the open launch tube  the shutters immediately closed it  the automatically activated compressors began to flush the hall with fresh air  in i was unaware of all this  with my hands on the desk  my face still burning with live fire  my hair curled and charred from a thermal stroke  and i was gasping for air full of the smell of burning and the characteristic smell of ionization  like ozone  i closed my eyes reflexively at the moment of take off  but the muzzle flame will hurt me  for a good while all i could see was black  red and gold circles  they kinda broke up  smoke  dust and fog disappeared  sucked into the whining drafts of the ventilation ducts  the first thing i saw was the greenish glow of the radar screen  i searched for the rocket  maneuvering the directional searchlight  by the time i finally caught her  she was already above the atmosphere  never in my life have i launched a projectile in such a mad and blind manner  having no idea how to accelerate it or where to send it  i thought it would be easiest if i put it into a circular orbit around solaris  at about a thousand kilometers altitude  and then i could turn off the engines  because as long as they were running  i wasnt sure if some incalculable catastrophe wouldnt happen  the thousand kilometer orbit was  as i saw from the table  stationary  and she didnt really guarantee anything  it was just the only way i could see  the speaker  which i turned off immediately after the start  did not have the courage to turn it on  i would rather do anything than to risk hearing that terrible voice again  in which there was no longer anything human  all pretense  i could tell myself  was stripped away  and through the semblance of  s face  another  real one began to be seen  to which the alternative of madness really became liberation  she was the first when i left the airport
