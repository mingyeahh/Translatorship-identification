I hastily folded Gibarians notes in four and pocketed them  I walked slowly over to the closet and looked inside   overalls and clothes were crammed together and crammed into one corner  as if someone had been standing there  The corner of an envelope was sticking out from under a pile of papers on the floor  I picked her up  It was addressed to me  With a sudden lump in my throat  I ripped open the envelope and had to force myself to unfold the small piece of paper that was stuck inside  In his regular hand  extremely small but legible  Gibarian wrote  Ann  solar  Vol  I  Anex  also  Vot  Separat  Messenger in the case of F  Ravintzers Little Apocrypha  That was all  not one more word  The writing bore signs of haste  Was it some important message  When did he write it  I thought I had to go to the library as soon as possible  I knew this annex to the first solarist yearbook  that is  I knew of its existence  but I never had it in my hands  because it was of purely historical value  But Ive never even heard of a Ravintzer or his  Little Apocrypha   What should I do  Im already fifteen minutes late  Once again  from the door  I took in the whole room  There was an unrolled Solaris map  There was something hanging behind the map  It was a pocket tape recorder in a case  I took out the camera  put the case back in its place  and put the tape recorder in my pocket  I looked at the counter   almost the entire reel was recorded  Again I stood for a second at the door with my eyes closed  I listened with effort to the silence outside  nothing  a circular chamber from which corridors branched out like the spokes of a wheel  when  passing a narrow side passage that seemed to lead to the bathrooms  I saw many an indistinct figure  almost merging with the semi darkness  I stopped transfixed  From the depths of this branch walked an unhurried  waddling gait of a huge black woman  I saw the flash of her whites and almost simultaneously heard the soft  bare slaps of her feet  She wore nothing but a shiny yellow skirt  as if made of straw  she had enormous  pendulous breasts  and black arms the size of a normal humans thighs  it passed me without so much as a glance in my direction   a meter away   and went on  swaying in its elephantine billows  like those Stone Age steatopygic carvings you sometimes see in anthropology museums  Where the corridor curved  she turned to the side and disappeared through the door of Gibarians cabin  As she opened them  she stood for a moment in the stronger light that burned in the room  The door closed silently and I was alone  I took the wrist of my left hand in my right hand and squeezed it with all my strength until the bones cracked  I looked around absently at my surroundings  What happened  What was that  As suddenly as if someone had hit me  I remembered Snauts warning  Whats that supposed to mean  Who was this monstrous Aphrodite  Where did it come from  I took one  just one step towards Gibarians cabin and froze  I knew all too well that I wouldnt go in there  I gasped for air with my widened nostrils  Something wasnt right  something wasnt right   ah  Instinctively  I expected the foul  distinct stench of her sweat  but even as she passed me a step  I felt nothing  I dont know how long I stood against the cool metal of the wall  Silence filled the station  the only audible sound being the distant  monotonous hum of the air conditioning compressors  I slapped my face lightly with my open hand and slowly walked to the radio station  As I turned the handle  I heard a sharp voice    Whos there    Its me  Kelvin  He was sitting at a table between a stack of aluminum boxes and a transmitter console  eating meat concentrate straight from a can  I dont know why he chose a radio station for his apartment  I stood dumbfounded at the door  staring at his steadily chewing jaws  and suddenly I felt how hungry I was  I went to the shelves  picked the least dusty plate from the pile  and sat down across from him  We ate in silence for a while  then Snaut got up  took a thermos flask from the wall cupboard  and poured us each a glass of hot broth  Putting the thermos on the floor  there was no room left on the table  he asked    Have you seen Sartorius    No  Where is he    On top  There was a lab upstairs  We ate in silence as the tin grated in the empty can  It was night at the radio station  The window was closed tightly from the outside  four round fluorescent lamps were burning in the ceiling  Their reflections vibrated in the plastic cover of the transmitter  Red veins lined the taut skin of Snauts cheekbones  He was now wearing a black  loose  tattered sweater    Do you have anything  he asked    No  Whats going to happen to me    Youre sweating  I wiped my forehead with my hand  I was indeed dripping sweat  it must have been a reaction from the previous shock  He looked at me searchingly  Should I have told him  I wish he had shown me more confidence  Who was playing against whom and in what incomprehensible way   Its hot   I said   I thought the air conditioning worked better for you    Itll even out in about an hour   Are you sure its just from the heat  he looked up at me  I chewed conscientiously as if I hadnt seen it    What are you going to do  he finally asked when we had finished eating  He dumped the entire dish and empty cans into the washroom by the wall and returned to his chair   I will comply with you   I replied phlegmatically  Do you have a research plan  Some new stimulus  supposedly X ray or something  right    X ray  he raised his eyebrows    Where did you hear about it    I dont remember anymore  Someone told me  Maybe on Prometheus  What  Are you doing it already    I do not know the details  It was Gibarians idea  He started it with Sartorius  But how can you know about it  I shrugged    Dont know the details  You should be there  because its within your scope   I didnt finish  He was silent  The whines coming from the air conditioners died down  and the temperature remained at a bearable level  There was only a constant high pitch in the air  like the buzzing of a dying fly  Snaut got up  walked over to the control panel  and began clicking contacts pointlessly  because the main switch was in the dead position  He played with it for a while  and without turning his head  he noticed    We will have to complete the formalities in connection with this     you know    Yes  He turned and looked at me as if close to fury  I cannot say that I deliberately tried to upset him  but not understanding anything of the game that was going on here  I preferred to be restrained  A bony apple was crawling over the black tube of his sweater   You were with Gibarian   he said suddenly  It wasnt a question  I raised my eyebrows and looked him calmly in the face   You were in his room   he repeated  I made a small movement of my head  as if to say  lets say    lets say   I wanted him to keep talking    Who was there  he asked  Knew about her      No one  And who could be there  I asked    Then why didnt you let me in  I smiled    Because I got scared  After your warning  when the doorknob moved  I held it instinctively  Why didnt you say it was you  I would have let you in   I thought it was Sartorius   he said uncertainly    So what of it    What do you think about    what happened there    he answered the question with a question  I hesitated    You must know better than me  Where is he   In the cooler   he replied immediately    We moved him early in the morning    because of the heat    Where did you find him    In the wardrobe    In the closet  Was he dead  His heart was still beating  but he wasnt breathing  It was agony    Did you try to save him    No    Why  He hesitated    I did not make it  He died before I put him down    Was it in the closet  Between these overalls    Yes  He walked over to a small desk in the corner and fetched a sheet from it  He put it in front of me   I wrote up a makeshift protocol   he said   Its even good that youve seen your room   Cause of death    injection of a lethal dose of pernostal  There you have it written    I ran my eyes through the short text   Suicide     I repeated softly    And the reason       An upset    depression    or whatever you want to call it  You know this better than me   I only know what I see   I replied  looking down into his eyes as he was standing over me    What do you mean by that  he asked calmly   He injected himself with pernostal and hid in a closet  right   If so  it was not depression  not an upset  but acute psychosis  Para noia    He must have thought he saw something    I spoke slowly  looking into his eyes  He walked away to the radio console and started clicking contacts again   Heres your signature   I said after a moment of silence    And Sartorius    Hes in the lab  I already told you  Doesnt show  I suppose      That what    That it shut down    Locked up  Ah  He disappeared  Please  Maybe he barricaded himself    Maybe   Snaut     I said   there is someone on the Station     Did you see   He looked at me  bent over    You warned me  before whom  Is it a hallucination    What did you see     Hes a man  isnt he  He was silent  He turned to the wall as if he didnt want me to watch his face  He drummed his fingers on the metal partition  I looked at his hands  There was no blood left on the ankles  I had a brief  like a flash  epiphany   This person is real   I said softly  almost in a whisper  as if I were telling him a secret that could be overheard    What  You can    touch her  She can    be hurt    last time you saw her was today    How do you know   He didnt turn around  He was standing against the wall  his chest against her as my words hit him    Just before I landed    Not long before     He shrank as if from a blow  I saw his crazy eyes    You       he choked out   who are you   He looked like he wanted to pounce on me  I didnt expect that  The situation turned upside down  He didnt believe I was who I said I was  Whats that supposed to mean   He looked at me with the utmost horror  Was it already a mistake  Poisoning  Everything became possible  But I saw her   this creature  and therefore I myself     also        Who it was  I asked  The words reassured him  He looked at me searchingly for a moment  as if he didnt believe me yet  I already knew it was a false pull and that he wouldnt answer me before he even opened his mouth  He sat down slowly in the chair and clasped his head in his hands    What is going on here     he said quietly    Maligna      Who was it  I asked again   If you dont know     he muttered    What    Thats nothing   Snaut   I said   were far enough from home   Lets play open cards  Everything is still messed up    What do you mean    To tell you who you saw    And you     he said suspiciously    Youre chasing in heel  I will tell you and you will tell me  You can be calm  I wont take you for a madman  because I know      For a madman  Great God  he tried to laugh    Man  but you nothing  nothing at all     but it would be a salvation  If he had believed for a moment that it was madness  he wouldnt have done it  he would have lived      So what you wrote in the report about the disorder is a lie    Of course    Why dont you write the truth    Why     he repeated  Silence fell  I was in complete darkness again  unable to understand anything  and for a moment it seemed to me that I could convince him that we would attack the riddle together  Why  why wouldnt he talk     Where are the vending machines  I replied    In warehouses  We have closed all except airport services    Why  He didnt answer again    You will not tell    I cant  There was something about it that I couldnt grasp  Maybe go upstairs to Sartorius  Suddenly I remembered the card  and that seemed to me the most important thing at that moment    Can you imagine further work in such conditions  I asked  He shrugged contemptuously    What does it matter    Ah yes  So what are you going to do  He was silent  The distant sound of bare footsteps could be heard in the silence  In the midst of nickel and plastic apparatuses  high cabinets with electronic apparatus  glasses  precision apparatuses  this sloppy  sloppy gait sounded like the clowns trick of someone insane  The stomping was getting closer  I stood up  watching Snaut with the greatest tension  He listened with narrowed eyes  but he didnt seem scared at all  So she wasnt afraid    Where did it come from  I asked  And when he lingered   You dont want to tell me     I do not know    Okay  The footsteps receded and fell silent    You do not believe me    he said    I give you my word that I dont know  Silently  I opened the suit closet and began to push apart their heavy  empty shells  As expected  there were gas guns on hooks at the back  used to move in a gravity free vacuum  They werent worth much  but they were weapons of some sort  I preferred one to none  I checked the pouch and slung the holster strap over my shoulder  Snaut watched me closely  As I adjusted the length of the thong  he showed his yellow teeth in a sneer    Happy hunting    he said   Thank you for everything   I replied  walking to the door  He sprang from his chair    Kelvin  I looked at him  He wasnt smiling anymore  I dont know if Ive ever seen such a tired face   Kelvin  its not    I    I really cant   he stammered  I waited to see if he would say anything else  but he just moved his lips as if to force something out  I turned and left without a word
