the corridor was empty  it went straight at first  then turned right  i have never been to the station  but for six weeks i lived   as part of the initial training   in its exact copy  located at the institute  on earth  i knew where the aluminum steps led  the library was unlit  i finally found the contact  when i searched the file for the first volume of the solarian yearbook with an appendix  a red light turned on when i pressed a button  i checked the recorder   the book was with gibarian  as was the other one   the little apocrypha  i turned off the light and went back downstairs  i was afraid to go into his cabin  despite the footsteps i had heard earlier  she might have come back  clenching my jaw  i forced myself to go in  the lighted room was empty  i began to flip through the books lying on the floor by the window  at one point i went to the wardrobe and closed it  i couldnt look at that empty space between the overalls  there was no annex under the window  methodically  volume after volume  until reaching the last pile of books between the bed and the cupboard  i found the volume i was looking for  hoping to find some clue in it  and there was a bookmark in the list of names  a name circled in red pencil that i didnt know it didnt say andre berton  it was on two different sites  i looked at the previous site first and found out that berton was the back up pilot of shan nahans ship  the next reference to him was over a hundred pages away  immediately after landing  the expedition proceeded with extreme caution  but when  after sixteen days  it turned out that the plasma ocean not only showed no signs of aggressiveness  but recoiled from any object approaching its surface and  if possible  avoided direct contact with devices or people   shannahan and his deputy timo lis lifted some of the precautionary measures  as they made the work extremely difficult and delayed  the expedition was then broken up into small groups of two and three people  often making flights over the ocean for several hundred miles  the blasters previously used as cover  closing the work area  were placed in the base  the first four days after this change in methodology were uneventful  apart from the occasional failure of the suits oxygen equipment  as the exhaust valves proved to be sensitive to the corrosive effects of the poisonous atmosphere  therefore  they had to be replaced with new ones almost every day  on the fifth day  and the twenty first from the moment of landing  two researchers  carucci and fechner  the first was a radiobiologist and the second a physicist   made an exploratory flight over the ocean in a small two person aeromobile  it was not a flying vehicle  but a glider that moves on a cushion of compressed air  when they didnt return six hours later  timolis  who was in charge of the base in shannahans absence  sounded the alarm and sent all available men to look for it  by a fatal coincidence  radio contact broke down that day  about an hour after the exploration parties left  the cause was a large red sun spot  sending strong corpuscular radiation into the upper atmosphere  only ultra short wave machines worked  allowing communication over a distance not exceeding twenty something miles  to make matters worse  the fog thickened before sunset and the search had to be abandoned  just as the rescue teams were returning to the base  one discovered the aeromobile  only 80 miles from shore  the engine was running and the machine  undamaged  was floating above the waves  there was only one half conscious person in the transparent cabin   carucci  the airmobile was brought to the base and carucci was treated  he regained consciousness that same evening  he could not say anything about fechners fate  he only remembered that when they were about to return  he began to feel short of breath  the exhaust valve of his breathing apparatus was sticking  and a small amount of poisonous gas was released into the suit with each inhalation  fechner  trying to fix his apparatus  had to unfasten his seatbelts and stand up  that was the last thing carucci remembered  the supposed course of events  according to experts estimates  was as follows  while repairing caruccis apparatus  fechner opened the roof of the cabin  probably because he was unable to move freely under the low dome  this was acceptable because the cabin of such machines is not hermetic and is only a shield against weather and wind  during these manipulations  fechners oxygen apparatus must have broken down  which  dazed  climbed up  climbed out through the opening of the dome onto the back of the machine and fell into the ocean  this is the story of the oceans first victim  the search for the body   it should have floated in the suit   yielded no results  in fact  it might have floated  thorough searching of thousands of square miles of almost perpetually mist covered  undulating desert was beyond the expeditions capabilities  by dusk   returning to previous events   all the cameras returned  except for the large cargo helicopter on which berton flew out    he appeared over the base almost an hour after darkness fell  when there was already serious fear for him  he was in a state of nervous shock  he got out of the apparatus under his own power only to make a run for it  restrained  he shouted and cried  for a man who had seventeen years of space travel under some of the harshest conditions  it was astonishing  doctors assumed that berton was also poisoned  after two days  berton  who  even after regaining his apparent equilibrium  refused to leave the interior of the expeditions main rocket even for a moment  or even to approach the window overlooking the ocean  declared that he wished to report on his flight  he insisted that it was of the utmost importance  this report  after being examined by the expedition council  was considered a morbid creation of a mind poisoned by the gases of the atmosphere  and as such was added not to the expeditions history  but to bertons history of illness  with which the whole thing ended  thats what the annex said  i guessed the crux of the matter was  of course  bertons report itself   what had driven the long range pilot to a nervous breakdown  i went through the books a second time  but i couldnt find the little apocrypha  i was getting more and more tired  so i put off further searching until tomorrow and left the cabin  as i passed the aluminum stairs  i saw patches of light falling from above on the steps  so sartorius was still working at this hour  i thought i should see him  it was a little warmer upstairs  there was a faint breeze in the wide  low corridor  strips of paper fluttered frantically over the air vents  the door of the main laboratory was a thick slab of rough glass  framed in a metal frame  the inside of the glass was darkened  the only light coming in through the narrow ceiling windows   sartorius   i called   doctor sartorius  its me  new kelvin  i have to i want to see you  please open it  a faint murmur  like someone treading on crumpled paper  then silence again    its me  kelvin  youve heard of me  i flew in the prometheus a few hours ago  i called  bringing my mouth closer to where the door frame met the metal frame    doctor sartorius  theres no one here but me  please open for me  silence  then a faint murmur  a few clicks  very distinct  as if someone were stacking metal tools on a metal tray  and all at once i was dumbfounded  there was a series of tiny footsteps  like a babys trot  the dense  hasty shuffling of little legs  i think     someone must have been imitating them with extremely skillful fingers on some empty  well resonating box    doctor sartorius    i roared    are you opening or not   no answer  just that childish jog again  and at the same time a few quick  barely audible  sweeping steps  as if the man was walking on tiptoe  but if he was walking  he couldnt imitate a childs gait at the same time  what do i care anyway    i thought and  no longer restraining the rage that was beginning to overwhelm me  i boomed    doctor sartorius    i didnt fly sixteen months to be stopped by your comedies    i count to ten  then i will blow the door    i doubted id make it  the gas pistols recoil isnt very strong  but i was determined to carry out my threat one way or another  even if i had to go in search of explosives  which im sure were in stock  i told myself that i mustnt give in  that is  i mustnt keep playing the maddened cards that the situation throws into my hands  there was a sound as if someone was wrestling or pushing something  the curtain in the middle parted maybe half a meter  a slender shadow fell on the surface of the frost covered door  and a slightly hoarse treble spoke    i will open it  but you must promise not to go inside    why do you want to open it   i boomed    ill go to you    okay  i promise  there was a slight click of a key turning in the lock  then a dark silhouette covering half the door carefully drew the curtain back  some intricate operations were going on there   i heard the creak as if a wooden table was being moved  finally the light colored pane parted enough for sartorius to slip through  into the corridor  he stood in front of me  blocking the door with himself  he was extraordinarily tall  thin  and beneath his cream leotard his body seemed to consist of nothing but bones  a black handkerchief was wrapped around his neck  over his shoulder hung a chemical scorched protective lab coat folded in two  he held his extremely narrow head to one side  curved black glasses obscured almost half of his face  so i couldnt see his eyes  he had a long lower jaw  bluish lips and huge  as if frostbitten  because also bluish ears  he wasnt shaved  red rubber anti radiation gloves hung in loops from his wrists  we stood like that for a while  looking at each other with undisguised reluctance  what was left of his hair  he looked as if he had cut his own crest with a razor  was leaden  his stubble was quite gray  his forehead was tan  like snauts  but the tan ended about halfway up in a horizontal line  he must have been wearing some sort of skullcap in the sun   im listening   he said finally  it seemed to me that he was not so much waiting for what i had to say to him as listening intently to the space behind him  still pressing his back against the glass pane  for a good moment  i didnt know how to speak without shooting something stupid   my name is kelvin    you must have heard of me   i began   i am  i mean    i was an associate of gibarian     his thin face  all vertical lines   thats what a don quixote must have looked like   was expressionless  the black curved plate of the glasses aimed at me made it extremely difficult for me to speak    i found out that gibarian    is dead    i put my voice on hold    yes  excuse me     it sounded impatient    did he commit suicide     who found the body  you or snaut    why are you addressing this to me  didnt dr  snaut tell you       i wanted to hear what you have to say about this      are you a psychologist  dr  kelvin    yes  what    scholar    yeah  what does that have to do with      i thought you were a criminal official or a police officer  its now two forty  and instead of trying to get involved in the work going on at the station  which would ultimately be understandable despite this brutal attempt to break into the lab  youre questioning me as if i were at least a suspect  i controlled myself with an effort that made sweat break out on my forehead    you are a suspect  sartorius  i said in a strangled voice  i wanted to hit him at all costs  so i added fiercely    and you know it perfectly well   if you dont cancel it and apologize to me  ill file a complaint against you on the radio report  kelvin     what should i apologize to you for  for the fact that instead of accepting me  instead of honestly introducing me to whats going on  you lock yourself up and barricade yourself in a laboratory   have you completely lost your mind   who are you  a scholar or a wretched coward   what  can you answer me     i dont know what i was shouting  he didnt even move  thick beads of sweat ran down his pale  porous skin  suddenly i realized  he wasnt listening to me at all  he hid both hands behind him  holding the door with all his strength  which shook slightly  as if someone was pressing against it from the other side   let    you    go away     he groaned suddenly in a strange  high pitched voice    please    for gods sake  go downstairs  ill come  ill come  ill do whatever you want  but please go    there was such anguish in his voice that  quite stunned  i instinctively raised my hand to help him hold the door open  which was what he was clearly fighting for  but then he let out a terrible scream  as if i had aimed a knife at him  so i started backing away  he screamed still falsetto  go  go     then again  im coming back  im coming back  im coming back    no  no     he opened the door a crack and rushed inside  i thought something golden flashed across his chest  like a shiny disc  there was a dull thud from the lab now  the curtain flew sideways  a great tall shadow flitted across the glass screen  the curtain returned to its place and nothing was visible  what was going on there   footsteps pounded  the frantic race ended with a terrifying glass thud  and i heard the laughter of a child    my legs were shaking beneath me  i looked in all directions  there was silence  i sat on a low plastic window sill  i must have been sitting like that for a quarter of an hour  i dont know  waiting for something or just so driven to the extreme that i didnt even want to get up  my head was literally bursting  somewhere high up  i heard a long grinding  and at the same time the surroundings brightened  from my position  i could only see part of the circular corridor that ran around the laboratory  it was at the very top of the station  just below the shield of outer armor  so the outer walls were concave and sloping  with windows placed every few meters  like embrasures  the flaps covering the outside were just rising up  the blue day was coming to an end  blinding light shone through the thick windows  every nickel strip  every doorknob blazed like a little sun  the door to the laboratory   that great slab of rough glass   glowed like the opening of a hearth  i looked at my hands  gray in the ghostly light  folded in my lap  in the right hand i held a gas pistol  i had no idea when or how i had snatched it from its case  i let him back in  i already knew that not even the atomic blaster would help me  what could i do with it  smash the door  break into the lab  i got up  a shield  like a hydrogen explosion  falling into the ocean  sent after me a horizontal beam of rays  almost material  when they hit my cheek  i was already walking down the steps   it was like applying a hot seal  halfway down the stairs i changed my mind and went back upstairs  i walked around the lab  as i said  the corridor circled them  after a hundred paces  i found myself on the other side  opposite a very similar glass door  i didnt try to open them  i knew they were locked  i was looking for a window in the plastic wall  even a crack  the thought of spying on sartorius did not strike me as wicked at all  i wanted to stop guessing and know the truth  though i couldnt imagine how i would be able to understand it  it occurred to me that the light in the laboratory rooms was provided by ceiling windows  i e  windows in the outer armor  and if i got outside i might be able to look in through them  for this purpose  i had to go downstairs to get a suit and a breathing apparatus  i stood at the stairs  wondering if the game was worth the candle  it was quite possible that the glass of the upper windows was frosted  but what was left to me  i went down to the middle level  i had to walk past the radio station  the door was wide open  he was sitting in the chair as i had left him  he was asleep  at the sound of my footsteps  he jumped and opened his eyes    hello  kelvin  he replied hoarsely  i was silent    well  did you find out anything  he asked   yes   i replied slowly    hes not alone  he twisted his mouth    well well  at least  thats something  has guests  you say   i dont understand why you wont tell me what it is   i said casually   ill find out sooner or later if i stay here anyway   so why these secrets   youll understand when you have guests yourself   he said  he seemed to be waiting for something and didnt really want to talk to me    where are you going  he snapped as i turned around  i did not answer  the airport concourse was in the same condition as i left it  on the rise stood my charred canister wide open  i approached the suit racks  but suddenly i didnt feel like this escapade for outer armor  i turned around on the spot and walked down the winding stairs to the warehouses  the narrow corridor was full of cylinders and crates stacked on top of each other  the walls here were bare metal that gleamed bluish in the light  a few more steps and white frosted pipes of refrigeration equipment appeared under the ceiling  i followed them  they penetrated through a thick plastic sleeve into a sealed room  as i opened the heavy  two hand thick rubber rimmed door  a bone chilling chill engulfed me  i shivered  icicles hung from the thicket of snow covered coils  and here stood chests covered with a layer of snow  containers  shelves along the walls were full of cans and yellowish lumps of fat wrapped in transparent plastic  in the background  the barrel shaped roof sloped down  a thick curtain  sparkling with ice needles  hung there  i brushed off its edge  on a bed of aluminum gratings lay a great  oblong shape covered with gray matter  raise    i pulled the hem of the sheet and peered into gibarians severed face  black hair with a streak of gray above the forehead lay smoothly against the skull  the larynx stood high  breaking the neck  dry eyes stared vertically at the ceiling  a cloudy drop of ice gathered in the corner of the eyelid  the cold pierced me so hard that i had to keep my teeth from chattering  without letting go of the shroud  i touched his cheek with my other hand  it was quite as if i had touched frozen wood  his skin was rough with stubble that pierced it with black points  an expression of immeasurable  contemptuous patience was frozen in the folded lips  as i lowered the hem of the fabric  i noticed that on the other side of the body  several black oblong beads or beans  from the smallest to the largest  protruded from the folds  suddenly i froze  they were the toes of bare feet seen from the sole side  the egg shaped bellies of the toes sticking out slightly  under the crumpled edge of the shroud lay flattened black woman  she was resting on her face as if in a deep sleep  inch by inch i pulled away the thick material  the head  covered with hair  lumped into small  bluish bunches  lay in the crook of an equally black  massive arm  the gleaming skin of his back was strained by the rises of his spine  the colossal body was not animated by the slightest movement  i looked again at the bare soles of her feet  and a strange thing struck me  they werent flattened or compacted by the weight they had to support  they werent even calloused from going barefoot  they were covered with skin as thin as that of her back or arms  i tested this sensation by touching it  which was far more difficult for me than touching a dead body  then the unbelievable happened  this body  exposed to a twenty degree frost  was alive and moved  she pulled up her foot like a sleeping dog when you take him by the paw  shes going to freeze here  i thought  but her body was calm and not too cold  i could still feel the soft touch dissolving in my fingertips  i backed behind the curtain  lowered it  and returned to the corridor  it felt incredibly hot in there  the stairs led me right to the airport hall  i sat down on the rolled ring parachute and took my head in my hands  i felt bruised  i didnt know what was happening to me  i was devastated  my thoughts sliding down some precipice threatening to collapse   loss of consciousness  annihilation seemed to me an ineffable  unattainable grace  i had no reason to go to snaut or sartorius  i couldnt imagine that anyone could put together what i had experienced  what i had seen  what i had touched with my own hands  the only rescue   escape   explanation was the diagnosis of insanity  yes  i must have gone mad  immediately after landing  the ocean had such an effect on my brain   i was hallucinating after hallucinating  and if so  then it is not necessary to waste your strength in futile attempts to solve puzzles that do not exist in reality  but to seek medical attention  to call prometheus or some other ship from the radio station  to send distress signals  then something happened that i would not have expected  the thought that i was crazy calmed me down  i understood snauts words all too well   assuming that there was a snaut at all and that i had ever spoken to him  the hallucinations could have started much earlier   who knows if i wasnt still aboard the prometheus  struck by a sudden attack of mental illness and everything i experienced was the product of my irritated brain  but if i was sick  i could recover  and that at least gave me a hope of redemption that i couldnt possibly see in the tangled nightmares of a few hours of mere solarian experience  therefore  it was necessary  above all  to carry out some logically conceived experiment on myself   an experimentum cru cis   which would show me whether i was really crazy and a victim of my own fantasies  or whether  despite their absurdity and improbability  my experiences were real  i thought as i stared at the metal bracket that supported the airports superstructure  it was a steel mast protruding from the wall  fortified with convex sheets  painted aquamarine  in several places  at a height of about a meter  the paint had peeled off  probably from the rocket carts that had moved this way  i touched the steel  warmed it for a moment with my hand  knocked on the rolled edge of the protective sheet  can delirium reach such a degree of reality  maybe  i answered myself  after all  this was my field  i knew it  and is it possible to invent this crucial experiment  at first i thought not  because my sick brain  if it really is sick  will produce whatever delusions i ask of it  after all  not only in illness  but also in the most normal sleep  it happens that we talk to people we do not know when we are awake  that we ask these dream figures questions and hear their answers  at the same time   although these people are in fact only the fetuses of our own psyche  its pseudo independent parts  as it were  temporarily isolated  we do not know what words will come out of their mouths until they speak to us  in this dream   and yet they really are words prepared by that isolated part of our own mind  and so we should know them the moment we invented them ourselves  to put them in the mouth of a fictional character  so whatever i planned and accomplished  i could always tell myself that i had done just as one does in a dream  neither snaut nor sartorius had to exist in reality  so asking either of them was futile  i thought i could take some medicine  some potent drug  like peyote or some other drug that causes hallucinations and vivid visions  experiencing such phenomena would prove that what i took really exists and is part of the material reality that surrounds me  but even this  i continued the thought  would not be a desirable key experiment  because i knew how the drug  which i had to choose myself  should work  and so it could be that both taking this drug and its effects would be equally creations  my imagination  it seemed to me that i would not be able to break out of the circle of madness   after all  one cannot think otherwise than with the brain  one cannot go outside oneself to check the normality of the processes taking place in the body  when suddenly an idea as simple as what apt  i jumped off the stack of rolled up parachutes and ran straight for the radio station  it was empty  i casually glanced at the electric clock on the wall  it was almost four oclock in the night  the night of the station  for it was a red dawn outside  i quickly activated the long range radio equipment  and while i waited for the lamps to warm up  i reconsidered the various stages of the experiment in my head  i couldnt remember what the call signal for the solarid satellites automatic station was  but i found it on a sign above the main console  i sent the call in morse code and eight seconds later i got a reply  the satellite  or rather its electronic brain  reported itself with a rhythmically repeated signal  i then demanded that he tell me which meridians of the stellar bowl of the galaxy he crossed at twenty second intervals as he orbited solaris  to the fifth decimal place  then i sat down and waited for an answer  she came ten minutes later  i tore off the paper tape with the result printed on it and put it away in a drawer  i was careful not to even glance at it   fetched great sky charts  logarithmic tables  a daily satellite almanac  and a few reference books from the library  and set about searching  answers to the same question  i spent nearly an hour putting together equations  cant remember the last time i counted so much  probably still during my studies on the exam in practical astronomy  i did the calculations on the stations big calculator  my reasoning was as follows  from the sky charts i should get numbers that didnt quite match up with the data provided by the satellite  not exactly  because the satellite undergoes very complex perturbations due to the gravitational forces of solaris  its two suns orbiting each other  as well as the local changes in gravity caused by the ocean  when i have two series of numbers  given by satellite and calculated theoretically based on sky charts  i will introduce corrections to my calculations  then both groups of results should coincide up to the fourth decimal place  deviations will remain only in fifth places  as caused by the incalculable activity of the ocean  even if the numbers provided by the sateloid are not reality  but the product of my deranged mind  they will not be able to coincide with the second series of figures  for my brain may be sick  but it would not  under any circumstances  be able to carry out the calculations made by the great calculator of the station  for it would require many months of time  so  if the numbers match  the stations great calculator is real  and i was using it in reality  not in delirium  my hands trembled as i took a paper telegraph tape from the drawer and spread it next to the other  wider one from the calculator  the two rows of figures matched as i had predicted  up to the fourth place  deviations appeared only on the fifth  i put all the papers in the drawer  so the calculator existed independently of me  this entailed the reality of the station and all that was on it  i was about to close the drawer when i noticed that it was filled with a sheaf of sheets covered with impatient calculations  i pulled it out  one glance showed that someone had already conducted an experiment similar to mine  except that instead of data relative to the star bowl  he had requested the satellite to measure solariss albedo at forty second intervals  i wasnt mad  the last glimmer of hope has gone out  i turned off the transmitter  drank the last of the broth from the thermos  and went to sleep
