I lay in the dark room  numb  staring at the glowing face of the watch on my wrist for I dont know how long  I listened to my own breathing and wondered about something  but all this  staring at the greenish ring of numbers and surprise  was immersed in an indifference that I attributed to fatigue  I turned on my side  the bed was strangely wide  something was missing  I held my breath  There was complete silence  I froze  There was not the slightest murmur  hare  Why couldnt I hear her breathing  I began to run my hands over the sheets  I was alone    Harry  I wanted to speak  but I heard footsteps  Someone big and heavy  like      Gibarian  I said calmly    Yes  its me  Dont turn on the light    No    Theres no need to  It will be better for both of us    But youre dead    Thats nothing  Do you recognize my voice    Yes  Why did you do that    I had to  Youre four days late  If youd arrived earlier  maybe it wouldnt have been necessary  but dont blame yourself  Im not bad    Are you really here   Ah  you think Im dreaming  how did you think about Harey     Where she is    How do you know I know    My guess is    Keep it to yourself  Lets say Im here instead of her  But I want her to be too    It is impossible    Why  Look  but do you know its really not you  its me    No  Its really me  If you wanted to be pedantic  you could say its me again  But lets not waste words    Will you leave    Yes    And then shell come back    You care about it  What is she to you    Its my thing    Youre afraid of her    No    And you disgust      What do you want from me  You can pity yourself  not her  She will always be twenty  Dont pretend you dont know it  All of a sudden  I dont know why  I cooled down  I listened to him quite calmly  It seemed to me that he was closer now  at the foot of the bed  but still I couldnt see anything in the darkness    What do you want  I asked quietly  My tone seemed to surprise him  He was silent for a moment    Sartorius convinced Snaut that you deceived him  Now they will deceive you  Under the guise of installing X ray equipment  they build a field annihilator    Where she is  I asked    Didnt you hear what I told you  I warned you    Where she is    I do not know  Be careful  you will need a weapon  You cant count on anyone   I can count on Harey   I said  I heard a quiet  quick sound  He laughed    Of course you can  Up to a certain limit  After all  you can always do what I do    Youre not a Gibarian    Please  and who  your dream maybe    No  Their dummy  But you dont know it    And how do you know who you are  This made me wonder  I wanted to get up  but I couldnt  Gibarian was saying something  I did not understand the words  I heard only the sound of his voice  I fought desperately against the weakness of my body  once again with the greatest effort I jerked     and woke up  I was gasping for air like a half suffocated fish  It was quite dark  Its a dream  Nightmare  Wait     a dilemma we cant solve  We are persecuting ourselves  The Polytheria merely used a kind of selective amplifier of our thoughts  The search for the motivation of this phenomenon is anthropomorphism  Where there are no people  there are also no motives available to man  In order to continue the research agenda  one must either annihilate ones own thoughts or their material realization  The first is beyond our power  The second is too much like murder  I listened in the darkness to that measured  distant voice  the sound of which I recognized immediately  it was Gibarian speaking  I stretched out my hands  The bed was empty  I woke up to another dream  I thought  my voice broke off immediately  in the middle of a word  Something clicked softly and I felt a faint breeze on my face   Well  Gibarian   I murmured  yawning  Gibarian   I repeated louder  The springs of the bed shook   Kris    its me     a whisper sounded right next to me   Its you  Harey    and Gibarian    Kris    Kris    its him no    you yourself said he was dead     He may be alive in a dream   I said slowly  I was no longer sure it was a dream   He said something  He was here   I said  I was terribly sleepy  Im asleep  I thought idiotically  brushing my lips against Hareys cool shoulder and getting more comfortable  in oblivion  In the morning  in a red lit room  I remembered the events of that night  I dreamed of talking to Gibarian  but after that  I heard his voice  I could have sworn on it  I just couldnt remember what he was saying  It didnt sound like a conversation  more like a lecture  Lecture     Harley was washing up  I heard the splash of water in the bathroom  I looked under the bed where I had thrown the tape recorder a few days ago  He wasnt there    Harry  I called  Her dripping face appeared from behind the wardrobe    Have you ever seen a tape recorder under the bed  A small  pocket sized      There were all sorts of things in there  I put everything there   She pointed to a shelf by the medicine cabinet and disappeared into the bathroom  I jumped out of bed  but the search yielded no results   You must have seen him   I said when she came back into the room  She said nothing as she combed her hair in front of the mirror  Only now did I notice that she was pale  and there was something searching in her eyes as they met mine in the mirror   Harey   I started like a donkey again   the tape recorder isnt on the shelf     Dont you have anything more important to tell me      Sorry   I muttered   youre right  its stupid  That was all we needed to start arguing  Then we went to breakfast  Harey was doing everything differently than usual today  but I couldnt tell the difference  She looked at the surroundings  several times she did not hear what I was saying to her  as if falling into a sudden fixation  Once  when she raised her head  I saw her eyes glaze over    Whats wrong  I lowered my voice to a whisper    Are you crying    Oh  leave me alone  These arent real tears  she stammered  Perhaps I shouldnt have stopped there  but there was nothing I feared so much as  honest conversations   Besides  I had other things on my mind  and although I knew that the plots of Snaut and Sartorius had only been in my dreams  I began to wonder if there was any on the Station at all  I didnt think about what I would do with it  I just wanted to have it  I told Harey I had to look into the holds and the storage rooms  She followed me silently  I couldnt resist the urge to peek into the cooler  but I didnt want Harey to go in there  so I just opened the door a crack and took my eyes around the room  to see if the black one is still where it was before  The place seemed empty  I couldnt find anything that suited me  and I wandered around in a worse and worse mood until I suddenly realized that I couldnt see Harey  Zar and she came anyway   she stayed in the corridor   but the fact that she tried to get away from me  which was so difficult for her  even for a moment  should have made me think  But I still acted like I dont know who  or just like a moron  My head ached  I couldnt find any pills  and angry as hell I turned the entire contents of the first aid kit upside down  I didnt want to go to the operating room again  I was as clumsy as rarely that day  Harey wandered like a shadow around the cabin  sometimes disappearing for a while  in the afternoon  after we had eaten dinner  actually  she didnt eat at all  and I  with no appetite  because of my bursting headache  did not even try to encourage her to eat   suddenly sat down next to me and started picking at the sleeve of my sweatshirt    Well  whats up  I murmured mechanically  I wanted to go upstairs because the pipes seemed to carry a faint tapping echo that told me Sartorius was fiddling with the high voltage equipment  but I suddenly felt like Id have to go with Harey  whose presence in the library was still on  half explainable  there among the machines  might give Snaut an opportunity for some untimely remark   Kris   she whispered   how are we      I sighed involuntarily  I cant say it was my lucky day    As best as possible  What is it about again    Id like to talk to you    Please  Listen    But not like that    How  Well  I told you  you know  my head hurts  Im in a lot of trouble      A little good will  Kris  I forced a smile  He was miserable for sure    Yes honey  speak    Will you tell me the truth  I raised my eyebrows  I didnt like that start    Why would I lie    You may have reasons  Serious  But if you want    well  you know    then dont lie to me  I was silent  Ill tell you something and youll tell me something  Okay  It will be true  No matter what  I didnt meet her eyes  although she was looking for my eyes  I pretended not to see it   I already told you  I dont know how I got here  But maybe you know  Wait  me too  Maybe you dont know  But if you know  and you just cant tell me now  then maybe later  someday  It wont be the worst  Anyway  give me a chance  I felt an icy current running through my body    Baby  what are you saying  What chance     I babbled    Kris  whoever I am  Im definitely not a child  you promised  Say  That whoever I am got me so caught up in my throat that I could only stare at her  stupidly denying it with my head as if I was trying to prevent myself from hearing everything  Im not hiding anything     I answered hoarsely   Thats perfect   she replied  getting up  I wanted to say something  I felt I couldnt leave her like this  but all the words were stuck in my throat   Harey     She was standing at the window with her back turned  the empty ocean lay under the naked sky    Harey  if you think that    Harey  you know I love you      Me  I went over to her  I wanted to hug her  She freed herself by pushing her hand away   You are so  Do you love me  Id rather you hit me    Harey  darling    No  No  Better be silent   the shadow of the Station moved steadily on the waves Hareys jaw dropped to the floor  Water gurgled in the sinks  The red color turned to dirty red gold at the edges of the sky  If I knew what to do  Oh  if I knew  Suddenly it became quiet  Harry stood right behind me    No  Dont turn around   she said  lowering her voice to a whisper    Youre not to blame  Kris  I know  Do not worry  I extended my hand towards her  She fled to the back of the cabin and  picking up a whole stack of plates  said    Too bad  If they could break  Id break  oh Id break them all    For a moment I thought she was really throwing them to the ground  but she looked at me sharply and smiled  Dont worry  I wont make a scene  I woke up in the middle of the night  immediately tense and alert  and sat up in bed  the room was dark  a faint light from the corridor shone through the half open door  Something hissed venomously  the sound increasing with muffled  dull thuds  as if something large was thumping violently against the wall  Meteor  thought flashed    Pierced armor  There is someone  Prolonged wheezing  I sobered up the rest  It was the Station  not a rocket  and that awful sound    I ran out into the corridor  The door of the small studio was wide open  there was a light in there  I ran inside  A blast of terrible cold swept over me  The cabin was filled with steam  turning breath into snow  White flakes swirled over the bathrobe wrapped body  which was thumping weakly on the floor  As soon as I saw her  in that icy cloud  I rushed to her  grabbed her waist  the cloak burned my hands  she wheezed  I ran out into the corridor  past the rows of doors  I did not feel the cold anymore  only her breath coming out of my mouth in clouds of steam like a flame burned me shoulder  I folded her on the table  ripped the cloak over her chest  stared into her severed  twitching face for a second  the blood froze on her open mouth  blackened her lips  ice crystals gleamed on her tongue    Liquid oxygen  There was liquid oxygen in the lab  in Dewar vessels  I felt like I was breaking crisp glass as I lifted her  How much could she drink  Does not matter  Burnt trachea  throat  lungs  liquid oxygen eats more than concentrated acids  Her breath  rasping  dry as the sound of torn papers  was shallow  Her eyes were closed  Agony  I looked at the great glass cabinets with tools and medicine  Tracheotomy  Intubation  But no more lungs  They are burned  Medicines  So many drugs  Rows of colorful bottles and boxes filled the shelves  Snoring filled the room  mist still flowing from her open mouth  Hot water bottles    I started looking for them  but before I found them  I jumped to the other cupboard  threw boxes of ampoules  now a syringe  where  in sterilizers  I couldnt fold it with numb hands  my fingers were stiff and wouldnt bend  I banged my hand furiously on the lid of the sterilizer  but I didnt feel it  the only response was a faint tingling  The lying one wheezed louder  I jumped to her  Her eyes were open    Harry  It wasnt even a whisper  I couldnt get my voice out  I had a strange  intrusive face  like plaster  Her ribs flew under her white skin  her hair  wet from the melting snow  spilled over the headboard  She was looking at me    Harry  I couldnt say anything else  I stood like a block with these alien wooden hands  feet  lips  eyelids began to burn more and more  but I hardly felt it  a drop of blood dissolving in the warmth ran down her cheek  drawing a diagonal line  Her tongue twitched and disappeared  she was still wheezing  I took hold of her wrist  which was pulseless  and pulled the tails of my coat apart  and put my ear to the bitterly cold flesh just below her breast  Over a crackling noise like fire  I heard a thud  galloping tones too fast to count  I was standing  bent low  eyes closed  when something touched my head  She slipped her fingers into my hair  I looked into her eyes   Kris   she wheezed  I took her hand  she responded with a grip that almost crushed my hand  consciousness fled from her horribly contorted face  whites glistened between her eyelids  her throat snored and her whole body vomited  I could barely hold it  slung over the edge of the table  She banged her head against the edge of the porcelain funnel  I held her up and pinned her to the table  each time she spasms  she would break away from me  I was sweating instantly and my legs felt like jelly  When the vomiting subsided  I tried to lay her down  She crowed gasping for air  Suddenly Hareys eyes lit up in that terrible  bloody face   Kris   she wheezed   how    how long  Kris   She began to choke  frothing at the mouth  vomiting again  I held her with all my might  She fell onto her back until her teeth chattered and panted   No  no  no   she blurted out quickly with each exhalation  each one felt like her last  But the vomit came back again  and she threw herself into my arms again  sucking in breaths in short intervals with an effort that made all the ribs stick out  At last the eyelids slid halfway over her open  blind eyes  She froze  I thought it was over  I didnt even try to wipe the pink foam from her mouth  I was standing over her  leaning over her  hearing some distant  great bell  waiting for her last breath to drop to the floor  but she was still breathing  hardly a wheeze  quieter and quieter  and the tip chest  which had almost ceased to vibrate  was moving with the rapid rhythm of a beating heart  I stood hunched over as her face began to turn pink  I didnt understand anything yet  Only the insides of both my hands became wet  and I thought I was going deaf  something soft and elastic filled my ears  but I could still hear the ringing bell  now as deaf as a broken heart  She lifted her eyelids and our eyes met   Harey   I wanted to say  but my mouth seemed to be missing  my face was a dead  heavy mask  and I could only stare  Her eyes darted around the room  her head moved  It was quite quiet  Behind me  in some other  distant world  water was dripping steadily from an unscrewed tap  She raised herself on an elbow  She sat down  I stepped back  She was watching me   What   she said   what      Failed to  Why     Why are you looking like that     And suddenly  in a terrible scream    Why are you looking like that    Silence fell  She looked at her hands  She moved her fingers    Its me       she said   Harey   I said breathlessly  using only my lips  She raised her head    Harry     she repeated  She slid slowly to the floor and stood  She staggered  regained her balance  took a few steps forward  She did all this in a sort of stupor  looking at me as if she didnt see me    Harey  she repeated slowly again    But    I    Im not Harey  And who   me     Harey  And you  you   Suddenly her eyes widened  flashed  and a shadow of a smile of utter astonishment lit up her face    Maybe you too  Kris  Maybe you too   I stayed silent  leaning my back against the wardrobe where fear pushed me  Her hands dropped    She did not tell     No  because youre afraid  But  listen  I cant  You can not do this  I didnt know anything  I now  I still dont understand anything  Its not possible  I   she pressed her clenched  bleached hands to her chest   I know nothing but  except Harey  Do you think Im pretending  Im not pretending  holy word  Im not pretending  The last words turned into a groan  She fell to the floor sobbing  that scream as if it shattered something inside me  in one leap I got to her  grabbed her arms  she defended herself  pushed me away sobbing without tears  screaming    Let go  Let go  you are disgusting  I know  I dont want that  I dont want  You see  you see  its not me  not me  not me      Be silent  I shouted shaking her  we both screamed unconsciously  kneeling in front of each other  Hareys head flew  pounding against my shoulder  and I pressed it against me with all my strength  We suddenly froze  panting heavily  Water was dripping steadily from the faucet    Kris      she stammered pressing her face into my shoulder   tell me what should I do to be gone  Kris      Stop it  I shouted  She lifted her face  She was staring at me    How     you dont know either  Cant do anything  Nothing    Harey    have mercy      I wanted to    you saw it  No  No  Let go  I dont want you touching me  you are disgusted    Not true    Youre lying  You must be disgusted  I    myself    too  If I could  If only I could      Youd kill yourself    Yes    And I dont want to  do you understand  I dont want you to kill yourself  I want you here with me  and I dont need anything else  Huge gray eyes consumed me   How are you lying     she said quite quietly  I released her and got up from my knees  She sat on the floor    Tell me  what should I do to make you believe that I say what I think  That its true  There is no other    You cant tell the truth  Im not Harry    Who are you  She was silent for a long moment  Her chin twitched a few times until she lowered her head and whispered   Harey    but    but I know its not true   It wasnt me    you loved back there  in the past     Yes   I said    What was is no more  It died  But you  here  I love  Understand  She shook her head    You are good  Dont think I cant appreciate everything youve done  You did it the best you could  But he cant help it  When I sat by your bed in the morning three days ago  waiting for you to wake up  I knew nothing  It seems like a very  very long time ago  I acted like a madman  I had a fog in my head  I couldnt remember what happened before or after  and I wasnt surprised by anything  just like after anesthesia or after a long illness  And I even thought maybe I was sick  you just dont want to tell me  But then more and more things got me thinking  You know what things  Something dawned on me after your conversation there in the library  with whats his name  with Snaut  And since you didnt want to say anything  I got up in the middle of the night and played that tape recorder  I only lied that one time because I hid it afterwards  Kris  The one who said what was his name    Gibarian    Yes  Gibarian  Then I understood everything  although to be honest  I still dont understand anything  One thing I didnt know was that I couldnt    that I wasnt    that it would end like this    endlessly  He didnt say anything about it  Maybe he did  but you woke up and I turned off the tape  Still  I had heard enough to know that I was not a human  but an instrument    What are you talking about    Yes  To study your reactions or something  You all have one like me  It is based on memories or imaginations  repressed  Somehow  Besides  you know all this better than me  He said such terrible  unbelievable things  and if it wasnt for the fact that everything was right  I wouldnt have believed it    What was right    Well  that I dont need sleep and that I need to be with you all the time  Yesterday morning I still thought you hated me  and I was unhappy about it  God  how stupid I was  But tell me  tell me  could I have imagined  After all  he didnt hate his one at all  but how he talked about her  Only then did I realize that whatever I did  it didnt matter  because whether I wanted to or not  it must be like torture for you  In fact  its even worse  because the torture device is as dead and innocent as a stone that can fall and kill  And that a tool could wish and love well  I couldnt imagine  I wish I could at least tell you what was going on in me then  after I understood  after I listened to that tape  Maybe youd at least get some use out of it  I even tried to write it down      Is that why you turned on the light  I asked  struggling to make my voice suddenly choke    Yes  But nothing came of it  Because I was looking in myself  you know      them   that something else  I was completely crazy  I tell you  It seemed to me for some time that I had no body under my skin  that there was something else in me  that I was only a surface  To deceive you  Understand    I see    When you lie like this for hours at night  thinking can go very far and in very strange directions  you know      I know      But I felt my heart  and anyway I remembered that you tested my blood  What is my blood  tell me  tell me the truth  You can now    Same as mine    Really    I promise you    What does it mean  You know  I thought later that maybe its hidden somewhere in me  that it is     after all  it can be very small  But I didnt know where  I think now that it was actually an excuse on my part because I was very afraid of what I wanted to do and was looking for some other way out  But  Kris  if I have the same blood    if its what you say  then    No  thats impossible  I wouldnt be alive  would I  That means there is something  but where  Maybe in your head  But I think quite simply    and I dont know anything    If I thought that  I should know everything right away and not love you  just pretend and know that Im pretending    Kris  please tell me everything  what do you know  but maybe we can do something    What is to be done  She was silent    Do you want to die    I think so  There was silence again  I stood hunched over her  looking at the empty interior of the room  at the white enamel plates  at the shiny  scattered tools  as if looking for something badly needed  and I couldnt find it   Harey  can I say something too   She waited   Its true that youre not quite like me  But that doesnt mean youre any worse  Contrary  You can think what you want anyway  but thanks to this    you didnt die  A childish  pitiful smile spread over her face   Does that mean Im    immortal     I do not know  In any case  youre far less mortal than I am   Its terrible   she whispered    Maybe not as much as you think    But you dont envy me      Harey  its more a matter of your    destiny  so to speak  You know  here on the Station  your destiny is basically as dark as mine or any of ours  Theyll continue Gibarians experiment  and anything can happen      Or nothing   Or nothing  and Ill tell you  Id rather nothing happen  not even because of fear  although I guess that plays a role too  I dont know   but because it wont do any good   Of this one thing I am absolutely sure    It wont work  why  Its about this    ocean  She shuddered    Yes  For contact  I think its actually extremely simple  Contact means exchanging some experiences  concepts  or at least results  some states  but what if there is nothing to exchange  If an elephant is not a very large bacterium  then the ocean cannot be a very large brain  There may  of course  be action on both sides  As a result of one  I am looking at you now and trying to explain to you that you are dearer to me than the twelve years of my life I have devoted to Solaris  and that I want to be with you further  Maybe your coming was supposed to be torture  maybe a favor  maybe just a microscopic examination  An expression of friendship  a sneaky blow  maybe a mockery  Maybe all at once  or what seems to me most likely something else entirely  but what do you and I really care about the intentions of our parents  however different they may be  You can say that our future depends on these intentions  and I agree with that  I cant predict what will happen  Just like you  I cant even assure you that I will always love you  If so much has happened  anything can happen  Maybe Ill become a green jellyfish tomorrow  It does not depend on us  But in this  whats up to us  well be together  Isnt that enough   Listen     she said   theres something else   Do I    am I    very similar to her   You were very similar   I said   but now I dont know     How is it     She got up from the ground and looked at me with wide eyes    Youve already covered it   And youre sure its not her  but me   Me       Yes  You  I do not know  Im afraid if you really were her  I couldnt love you    Why    Because I did something terrible    Her    Yes  When we were      Dont tell    Why  Because I want you to know that Im not her
