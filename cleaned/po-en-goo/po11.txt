kris  is it because of this experiment  i cringed at her voice  i lay awake for hours  staring into the darkness  alone because i couldnt even hear her breathing  and in the tangled labyrinths of night thoughts  delirious  half sense and thus taking on a new dimension and meaning  i forgot about her    what    how do you know im awake     i asked  there was fear in my voice   after you breathe     she said softly  somewhat apologetically    i didnt mean to disturb you    if you cant  dont say      no  why  yes  thats the experiment  you guessed it    what do they expect from him    they dont know themselves  something  anything  this isnt operation think  its operation despair  now all it takes is one man who has the courage to take responsibility for the decision  but this kind of courage most people consider mere cowardice  because it is a retreat  you think  a resignation  an escape unworthy of a man  as if it were worthy of a man to wade and get bogged down and drown in something he doesnt understand and never will  i paused  but before my ragged breath subsided  a new surge of anger burst out of my mouth  even if we couldnt make contact  they said  by studying this plasma   all those crazy living cities that pop out of it every day to disappear   wed learn the mysteries of matter  as if they didnt know it was cheating  walking on library  written in an incomprehensible language  that you will only look at the colors of the spines     and how    arent there more planets like this    dont know  maybe there are  we only know this one  anyway  shes something extremely rare  unlike earth  we  we are common  we are the grass of the universe  and we pride ourselves on our commonness  that it is so common  and we thought that everything could be contained in it  it was such a scheme that set off boldly and joyfully into the distance  other worlds  so what are these other worlds  we will master them or we will be mastered  there was nothing else in those wretched brains  ah  not worth it  not worth it  i got up  groped for the first aid kit  a flat jar of sleeping pills   im going to sleep  darling   i said  turning to the darkness where the fan was whirring high    i have to sleep  otherwise  i dont know    i sat on the bed  she touched my hand  i grabbed her  invisible  and held her still until sleep loosened the grip  in the morning  when i awoke fresh and rested  the experiment seemed to me something trivial  i did not understand how i could attach such importance to it  also  the fact that harey had to come with me to the lab didnt matter much to me  all her efforts were in vain after my absence from the room for a few minutes  so i gave up any further attempts she insisted on  even ready to be locked up somewhere  and advised her to pick up a book to read  i was more interested in what i would find in the laboratory than the procedure itself  apart from quite significant gaps in the shelves and cabinets with analytical glass  moreover  some of the cabinets lacked glass  and the surface of one door was star shaped cracked  as if a fight had recently taken place here  the traces of which were hastily but meticulously removed  there was no nothing special about the blue room  snaut  bustling with the apparatus  behaved very correctly  took hareys appearance as something quite ordinary  and gave her a slight bow from a distance  while he was wetting my temples and forehead with saline  sartorius appeared  he entered through a small door leading to a darkroom  he was in a white cloak  with a black anti radiation coat thrown over him that reached down to his ankles  businesslike  brisk  he greeted me as if we were one of a hundred employees of a great earthly institute and had parted the day before  i noticed only now that his face was deadened by the contact lenses he wore under his eyelids instead of glasses  he stood with his arms crossed over his chest  watching snaut wrap the electrodes around my head with a bandage that formed a kind of white cap  he glanced around the room several times  as if not noticing harey at all  who  huddled  unhappy  sat on a small stool against the wall  pretending to read a book  as snaut moved away from my chair  i moved my metal and wire laden head to see him switch on the apparatus  but sartorius suddenly raised his hand and spoke solemnly   dr  kelvin   i am asking for a moment of attention and concentration  im not going to impose anything on you  because that wouldnt lead to the goal  but you must stop thinking about yourself  about me  about colleague snaut  about any other people  to eliminate the randomness of individual individuals  and focus on the cause we represent here  earth and solaris  generations of researchers constituting a whole  although individual people have their beginning and end  our tenacity in striving to establish intellectual contact  the extent of the historical path traveled by humanity  the certainty of its extension in the future  readiness for all sacrifices and hardships  to give all personal feelings to our mission   these are a number of topics that should fill your consciousness as thoroughly as possible  although the course of associations does not depend entirely on your will  the fact that you are here ensures the authenticity of the sequence i have presented  if you are not sure that you have completed the task  please say so and colleague snaut will repeat the record  weve got time    he said the last words with a pale  dry smile that didnt take away from his eyes an expression of piercing astonishment  i writhed internally from the steak of these so serious  so serious phrases  fortunately snaut broke the prolonged silence    can you  kris  he asked  leaning his elbow on the high electroencephalograph desk  in a casual and familiar pose  as if he was leaning on a chair  i was grateful to him for calling me by name   you can   i said  closing my eyes  the jitters that had emptied my mind as he finished attaching the electrodes and placed his fingers on the switch disappeared suddenly  and through my eyelashes i saw the pinkish glow of the control lights on the black plate of the apparatus  at the same time  the damp and unpleasant coolness of the metal electrodes  like cold coins around my head  disappeared  i was like a gray  unlit arena  this emptiness was assisted on all sides by a crowd of invisible spectators  amphitheatrically swelled around a silence in which ironic contempt for sartorius and the mission dissipated  the tension of internal observers  eager to play an impromptu role  was easing  hare  i thought the word tentatively  with nauseating anxiety  ready to withdraw it immediately  but my watchful  blind audience didnt protest  for a while i was all pure tenderness  sincere regret  ready for patient  long sacrifices  harey filled me without features  without shapes  without a face  and suddenly through her impersonal  desperate tenderness breathing concept with all the seriousness of its professorial countenance i saw giese  the father of solar studies and solarists  in the gray darkness  but it wasnt that muddy outburst i was thinking of  the fetid abyss that engulfed his gold glasses and dutifully brushed gray mustache  all i saw was the copperplate on the title page of the monograph  the densely hatched background the artist had framed his head that stood almost unsuspecting in a halo  so similar not in features but in honest  old fashioned consideration to my fathers face  and in the end i didnt know which one was looking at me  neither of them had a grave  a thing so common and ordinary in our times that it did not arouse any particular emotion  the image was gone  and for one moment  i dont know how long  i forgot about the station  about the experiment  about harey  about the black ocean  about everything  filled with the instantaneous certainty that these two  no longer existing  infinitely small  in dried mud  twisted men  they faced everything that befell them  and the peace of this discovery was shattered by the shapeless crowd that surrounded the gray arena in silent anticipation of my defeat  with the double click of the switched off apparatus  the artificial light burst into my eyes  i narrowed my eyes  sartorius looked at me searchingly  still in the same pose  snaut  with his back to him  bustling about the camera  deliberately as if shuffling clogs falling from his feet    do you think it worked  dr  kelvin  sartorius suspended his nasal  repulsive voice   yes   i said    are you sure  said sartorius with a hint of surprise or even suspicion    yes  the certainty and brusque tone of my answer distracted him for a moment from his rigid seriousness   thats   good   he muttered  and looked around as if he didnt know what to do now  snaut walked over to the chair and began to unwrap the bandages  i got up and walked around the room while sartorius  who had disappeared into the darkroom  returned with the film  already developed and dried  there were quivering  whitish serrated lines stretching over a dozen yards of tape  like some kind of mold or cobweb  splayed across a black  slippery web of celluloid  i had nothing else to do  but i didnt leave  the other two inserted a film into the burnished modulator head  the end of which sartorius watched again  frowning mistrustfully as if he was trying to decipher the meaning of those fluttering lines  the rest of the experiment was invisible  all i knew was what was going on when they were standing at the switchboards along the wall and activating the proper apparatus  the current woke with a faint bass hum in the embankment of coils under the armored floor  and then only the lights on the vertical glazed tubes of the gauges went down  indicating that the huge x ray gun tube was lowering down the vertical shaft to come to rest in its open mouth  the lights then froze on the lowest bands of the scale  and snaut began to increase the voltage until the pointers  or rather the white bands that replaced them  fanned half a turn to the right  the sound of the electricity was barely audible  nothing happened  the film drums were turning under the cover so that even that could not be seen  the meter ticking as silently as clockwork  harey looked from her book to me  then to them  i went over to her  she looked questioningly  the experiment was now ending  and sartorius walked slowly to the great conical head of the apparatus    are we going     harey asked with her mouth alone  i nodded  she got up  without saying goodbye to anyone   it would seem too pointless to me   i walked past sartorius  the tall windows of the upper corridor were filled with a sunset of singular beauty  it was not an ordinary  gloomy  swollen red  but all shades of lightly hazy pink  as if sprinkled with the smallest silver  the heavy  limply undulating blackness of the endless plain of the ocean seemed to respond to this gentle glow with a brown violet drizzle of soft reflection  only at the zenith the sky was still stubbornly red  i stopped suddenly in the middle of the lower corridor  i couldnt even think about the fact that we would be locked in a cabin open to the ocean again  like in a prison cell   harey   i said   you know    id look in the library    do you mind       oh  id love to  ill find something to read   she replied with a little artificial animation  i felt that there had been an unfilled rift between us since yesterday and that i should show her some affection  but complete apathy overtook me  i dont know what would have to happen for me to shake it off  we went back down the corridor  then up the ramp to a small vestibule  there were three doors  flowers between them like in some cases behind crystal glass  the middle door leading to the library was covered on both sides with raised imitation leather  i always tried not to touch it when opening it  inside  in the round  great hall  under the pale silver ceiling of stylized suns  it was a little cooler  i ran my hand along the spines of the set of solarian classics and was about to take out the first volume of giese  with that copper engraved likeness on the paper covered opening page  when i unexpectedly discovered gravinskys volume  unnoticed the previous time  in the size of an eight  i sat down in the padded chair  it was completely silent  a step behind me  harey was leafing through a book  and i could hear the pages slipping lightly under her fingers  gravinskys compendium  most commonly used as a mere  car  in college  was an alphabetical collection of solarian hypotheses  ranging from abiological to degenerative  the compiler  who had never even seen solaris  sifted through all the monographs  expedition protocols  snippets and temporary reports  he even studied quotations in the works of planetary scientists studying other globes  and gave a catalog that was a little frightening in terms of conciseness  because sometimes they turned into trivialities  having lost the subtle intricacy of thoughts that guided their birth  moreover  this whole  intended to be encyclopaedic  already presented rather of bizarre value  the volume was published twenty years ago  and in that time a mountain of new hypotheses had accumulated that could not be contained in a single book  scattered everywhere the richness of thought gave the impression that one of the hypotheses simply had to be right  that it was impossible for reality to be quite different  other than the myriad proposals hurled at it  gravinsky preceded it with a preface  in which he divided almost sixty years of solar studies known before him into periods  in the first one   dating from the initial exploration of solaris   no one actually consciously made hypotheses  it was then assumed  somehow intuitively  due to  common sense   that the ocean is a dead  chemical conglomerate  a monstrous lump of jelly flowing around the globe  which results in strange creations thanks to its  quasi volcanic  activity and the self generated automatism of processes stabilizes the unstable orbit  as the pendulum maintains an unchanging plane of motion once given  it is true that three years later magenon declared himself in favor of the animate nature of the  gelatinous machine   but gravinsky did not date the period of biological hypotheses until nine years later  when magenons previously isolated court began to gain more and more adherents  detailed theoretical models of the living ocean  supported by biomathematical analysis  the entire legacy of giese was then subjected to crushing criticism  the first atlases  catalogues  stereophotographs of asymmetrias  hitherto considered impossible to study  were created  and the breakthrough came thanks to new  remotely controlled devices that were sent into the turbulent depths of the colossi threatening to explode at every second  then it was on the fringe of the raging discussions that they started isolated  contemptuously suppressed mini malist hypotheses claiming that even if one fails to make the notorious  contact  with the  sentient monster   the study of ossifying mimoid cities and ballooning mountains that the ocean throws up to be reabsorbed they will probably bring valuable chemical  physico chemical knowledge  new experiences in the field of construction of giant molecules  but no one even engaged in polemics with the proponents of such theses  it was  after all  the period in which the catalogs of typical metamorphoses  valid to this day  or francks bioplasmic theory of mimoids were created  which  although abandoned as false  remained a great model of intellectual momentum and logical construction  these thirty odd years of  gravinskys periods  were naive youth  spontaneously optimistic romanticism  and finally   marked by the first skeptical voices   the mature age of solarism    hypotheses being their late progeny  about the apsychic nature of the solarian ocean  any search for manifestations of conscious will  teleological processes  action  motivated by the internal needs of the ocean  was almost universally recognized as some kind of aberration of an entire generation of researchers  the journalistic passion for refuting their claims prepared the ground for sober oriented  focused on the diligent accumulation of facts  the investigations of the group of holden  eonides  stoliwa  it was a time of rapid swelling and expansion of archives  microfilm files  expeditions  richly equipped with all possible cameras  automatic recorders  sensors  probes  such as what the earth could provide  in some years  more than a thousand people were involved in the research at a time  but while the rate of accumulating material constantly accumulating was still increasing  the spirit animating the scientists was already starving  and the period of decline of this still optimistic phase of solaria  which was difficult to delineate in time  was beginning exploration  it was characterized above all by great  courageous   sometimes theoretical imagination  sometimes negation   individuals such as giese  strobla or sevada  who   the last of the great solarists   died in mysterious circumstances near the south pole of the planet  having done something that does not happen even for a novice  he guided his camera  hovering low over the ocean  in front of a hundred observers  into the swiftness that was clearly moving out of his way  there was talk of some sudden weakness  fainting  or failure of the rudders  but in fact it was  i believe  the first suicide  the first sudden  overt outburst of despair  not the last one though  but gravinskys volume did not contain such data  i added dates  facts and details myself  looking at its yellowed  finely spotted pages  after that  there were no such pathetic attempts on ones own life  there were also no great individualities  recruitment of researchers dedicated to a specific field of planetology is actually a phenomenon that has not been studied by anyone  people of great abilities and great strength of character are born with more or less constant frequency  only their choice is not the same  their presence or absence in a given field of research may perhaps explain the perspectives it opens up  differently evaluating the classics of solaristics  no one can deny their greatness  sometimes genius  the best mathematicians  physicists  greats in biophysics  information theory  electrophysiology were drawn to the silent solarian giant for decades  suddenly  the army of explorers was taken from year to year  as it were  from leaders  what remained was a grey  nameless crowd of patient collectors  compilers  creators of many original experiments  but there was a lack of mass expeditions  intended on a global scale  and bold  unifying hypotheses  solaristics seemed to be falling apart and  as if in parallel with its descending flight  there were massively differing hypotheses about the degeneration  regression  and involution of the solarian seas  from time to time a bolder  more interesting take appeared  but all of them judged  as it were  the ocean  considered the final product of development  which long ago  millennia ago  went through the period of the highest organization  and now  united only physically  disintegrated into a swarm of useless  senseless  agonal creations  so already monumental  centuries long agony  thats how solaris was seen  looking for signs of carcinogenesis in long tails or mimoids  looking for signs of chaos and anarchy in the processes taking place in the liquid body  until this direction became an obsession  so that all the scientific literature of the next seven or eight years  although  of course  devoid of definitions expressing the feelings of its authors openly  is as if one heap of insults   revenge  taken by the lonely  leaderless  gray masses of solarists on the still equally indifferent object of strenuous research  ignoring their presence  i knew the solarian classics not included in this set  probably wrongly  the original works of a dozen or so european psychologists who had so much in common with solaristics that over a long period of time they studied the reactions of public opinion  collecting the most mediocre statements  voices of non professionals  and thus showed a surprisingly accurate the relationship of changes in this opinion with the processes that were simultaneously taking place within the scientific community  also within the coordinating group of the institute of planetology  where it was decided on material support for research  changes were taking place  expressed in a continuous  though gradual  reduction of the budget of institutes and solaristic facilities  as well as subsidies for teams going to the planet  voices about the need to reduce research were mixed with those who demanded the use of more active agents  but no one seemed to go further than the administrative director of the all earth cosmological institute  who insisted that the living ocean did not ignore people  but did not notice them  just as elephant   ants walking on its back  and in order to attract its attention and concentrate it on us  you need to use powerful stimuli and machines giants worthy of the whole planet  the amusing detail was that  as the press wryly pointed out  such costly endeavors had been requested by the director of the cosmology institute  not the planetary institute that funded solarian exploration  so it was generosity out of his own pocket  and then the cycle of hypotheses  refreshing the old ones  introducing insignificant changes  making them more precise or  on the contrary  ambiguous  began to change the so far clear  despite the extent  solaristics into an increasingly complicated labyrinth full of dead ends  in the atmosphere of universal indifference  stagnation  and discouragement  a second ocean of papers printed in vain seemed to accompany solarian time  about two years before i joined gibarians studio as a graduate of the institute  the mett irving foundation had been set up  offering high rewards to anyone who harnessed the energy of ocean glia for human needs  this has been tempted before  and more than one cargo of plasma jelly has carried spaceships to earth  methods of preserving it were also worked out long and patiently  using high or low temperatures  artificial micro atmosphere and microclimate  similar to solaria  fixative irradiation  and finally thousands of chemical recipes  all in order to observe a more or less sluggish process of decomposition  too  of course    like everything else  described many times with the greatest accuracy in all stages   self digestion  maceration  primary liquefaction  i e  early  and late  secondary  samples taken from all efflorescences and plasma formations met a similar fate  only the paths leading to the end were different  which was represented by an ash light  metallic gleam  diluted by auto fermentation  its composition  ratio of elements and chemical formulas could be given by any solarist awakened from sleep  the total failure to keep alive   or even in a state of suspended vegetation  some kind of hibernation   of a small or large particle of the monster outside its planetary organism gave rise to the belief  developed by the school of meunier and proroch  that there is really only one mystery to be guessed  and when we will open it with a properly selected interpretation key  everything will be explained at once    the search for this key  this solaris philosophers stone  wasted time and energy by people who had nothing to do with science  and in the fourth decade of the existence of solaristics  the number of maniacs coming from outside the scientific community of those possessed people  with the fervor of beating their former predecessors  such as the  perpetuum mobile  or  squaring the circle  prophets  has reached the proportions of an epidemic  even disturbing some psychologists  however  this passion died out after a few years  and when i was preparing to travel to solaris  it had long since left the newspaper columns and disappeared from the conversation  as well as the ocean issue  putting down gravinskys volume  i came across  as the books were arranged alphabetically  a tiny grattenstrom pamphlet  barely discernible between the thick spines  one of the more peculiar efflorescences of solarian writing  it was a work turned   in the struggle for understanding the extrahuman   against people themselves  against man  a kind of lampoon on our species  self taught work furious in its mathematical aridity  which  after first publishing a number of extraordinary contributions to certain very detailed and rather marginal branches of the quantum in physics  in his main  although only a dozen or so pages long  most extraordinary work  he tried to show that even the most seemingly abstract  the most theoretical  mathematized achievements of science  in fact  moved only a step or two away from the prehistoric  gross sensory  anthropomorphic understanding the world around us  tracing in the formulas of the theory of relativity  the force field theorem  in parastatics  in the hypotheses of the only cosmic field traces of the body  everything that is a derivative and effect of the existence of our senses  the structure of our organism  the limitations and imperfections of human animal physiology  grattenstrom came to the final conclusion that there can be no  contact  between man and a non human  ahumanoid civilization  in this lampoon for the whole species  not a word was mentioned about the thinking ocean  but its presence  in the form of a contemptuously triumphant silence  was felt under every almost a sentence  at least thats how i felt when i first read grattenstroms pamphlet  which was a curiosity rather than a solarianum in the normal sense  and it was in the classical collection because it had been inserted by gibarian himself  who had given it to me to read  with a strange  reverential feeling  i carefully slipped the thin one on even an unbound print between the books on the shelf  i touched the green and brown solarian almanac with my fingertips  with all the chaos  all the helplessness that surrounded us  it was undeniable that  through several days of experience  we had gained certainty on a few basic points on which a sea of ink had been wasted over the years  for they were  whether or not the ocean was a living thing might be doubted further by a lover of paradoxes and stubborn enough  but it was impossible to deny the existence of his psyche  whatever might be understood by that word  it was obvious that he saw our presence above each other all too well    this one statement destroyed the whole extended wing of solaristics  which claimed that the ocean was a  world in itself   a  being in itself   deprived by secondary atrophy of once existing sense organs  that it knew nothing about existence of phenomena or external objects  locked in the wheel of gigantic mental currents  which his seat  bed  and maker is his swirling abyss under two suns  and further  we learned that it can synthesize artificially what we ourselves cannot   our bodies  and even improve them by introducing incomprehensible changes into their subatomic structure  probably related to the goals it was guided by  so he existed  lived  thought  acted  the chance of reducing the  solaris problem  to nonsense or nothing  the notion that we were dealing with no being  and therefore our defeat was by no means a defeat   all of these collapsed once and for all  whether they wanted it or not  people now had to take note of a neighborhood that  though behind trillions of miles of vacuum  separated by light years  lay in their paths of expansion  more difficult to grasp than the rest of the universe  we may be at a turning point in history  i thought  even the dismantling of the station itself  i did not consider impossible or even improbable  but i did not believe that anything could be saved in this way  the very existence of a thinking colossus will never give people peace again  even if they cross the galaxies  even if they bond with other civilizations of creatures similar to us  solaris will be an eternal challenge to man eco  and another small leather bound volume had wandered through the almanac yearbooks  i stared at the finger darkened cover for a moment before opening it  it was an old book  that muntius introduction to solar studies  i remembered the night i spent on it  and gibarians smile when he gave me his copy  and the terrestrial dawn at the window when i came to the word  end     the goal towards which it strives is as foggy and dark as the communion of saints or the descent of the messiah  exploration is a liturgy that exists in methodological formulas  the humble work of researchers is the expectation of fulfillment  of the annunciation  because there are no and cannot be bridges between solaris and the earth  this one  as well as others  the lack of common experiences  the lack of concepts that could be communicated  are rejected by solarists  just as the arguments that refuted the aftermath were rejected by believers  the foundation of their faith  what else do people expect  what can people expect after  establishing informational contact  with thinking seas  a register of experiences related to an existence that does not end in time  so old that it probably does not remember its own beginning  a description of desires  passions  hopes and sufferings  liberating themselves in the instant births of living mountains  the transformation of mathematics into existence  loneliness and resignation   fully  but all this is untransferable knowledge  and if you try to translate it into any of the earthly languages  all sought values and meanings will be lost  they will stay on the other side  besides  it is not such revelations  worthy of poetics rather than science  that the  followers  expect  no  because they themselves are waiting for revelations without realizing it  which would explain to them the meaning of man himself  so solaristics is a post tomb of long dead myths  an bloom of mystical longings that human lips dare not express openly  with full voice  and the cornerstone hidden deep in the foundations of its edifice is the hope of redemption    but those unable to admit that it really is solarists carefully avoid any interpretation of contact  so that it becomes something final in their writings   and while in the original  still sober understanding it was supposed to be a beginning  an introduction  entering a new path  one of many   beatified  after many years it became their eternity and heaven    simple and bitter is the analysis of muntius  this  heretic  of planetology  dazzling in its negation  in shattering the solarian myth  or rather the mission of man  complete  ignorant silence  which was understandable  for accepting muntiuss words of solaristics as it existed  the beginnings of another  sober  resigning  waited in vain for their founder  five years after muntiuss death  when his book had already become a bibliographic rarity  a white raven  not to be found either in solarian collections or in philosophical book collections  a school named after him was established  the norwegian circle  in which  broken on the individuality of the thinkers taking over his heritage  the calmness of his lecture turned into the biting  fierce irony of erle ennesson  and in a somewhat trivialized version  into utilitarian solaristics  or  utilitarianism  of phaelanga  some fanciful striving for civilizational contact  for an intellectual communion of two civilizations  engendered by false hopes  but in the face of the merciless clarity of muntiuss analysis  the writings of all his spiritual disciples remain little more than contributory  if not mere popularization  with the exception of the works of ennesson and maybe takata  hes actually done the lice himself he called the first phase of solaristics   the period of  prophets   which he included giese  holden  sevada  the second he called  the great schism    the disintegration of the only solarian church into a bunch of warring confessions  and predicted a third phase   dogmatization and scholastic ossification  which will come when all that is to be explored has been explored  however  that did not happen  gibarian  i thought  was right  however  in considering muntius liquidation argument a monumental simplification  omitting everything that was contrary to the elements of faith in solaristics  because it was determined by the perpetual temporal nature of works  which promised nothing but a concrete  material globe orbiting two suns   tucked into muntiuss book was a yellowed  folded double copy from the parerga solariana quarterly  one of the first papers gibarian had written before he took over as director of the institute  such as an instruction to enumerate specific phenomena justifying the existence of real chances for contact  because gibarian belonged to  probably  the last generation of researchers who had the courage to refer to the early years of splendor  optimism and did not deny a specific faith  crossing the boundaries set by science  as material as possible  because it trusted in the success of efforts  provided they were persistent and relentless enough   it came from the well known  classic studies of eurasian bioelectronics  cho en min  ngyali and kawakadze  they showed elements of similarity between the brains electrical pattern and certain plasma discharges that precede the formation of such plasma formations as early stage polymorhas and twin solarids  he rejected overly anthropomorphic interpretations  all those mystifying theses of the psychoanalytic  psychiatric  and neurophysiological schools that tried to interpret individual human diseases into the glial ocean  such as epilepsy  whose analogy was supposed to be the spasmodic eruptions of asymmetriads   because he was one of the heralds of contact the most cautious and sober  and he hated nothing so much as the sensations which  it is true  very seldom accompanied this or that discovery  a wave of similar  cheapest interest was aroused by my diploma thesis  and there it was  unprinted  of course  somewhere in one of the microfilm trays  i based it on the revealing studies of bergmann and reynolds  who managed to isolate and  filter  out of the mosaic of color processes the components accompanying the strongest emotions   despair  pain  pleasure   and then i compared these records with the discharges of ocean currents and detected oscillations and profiling of the curves   on certain parts of the bowl of symmetry triads  at the base of immature mimoids  etc     displaying a remarkable analogy  this was enough to get my name soon in the tabloid press under clown titles like  jelly despairs  or  planet in orgasm  but it worked out  or so i thought until recently  to my advantage  because gibarian  who  like any other solarist  did not read all the thousands of works that appeared  especially novices  drew my attention and i got a letter from him  one  and it opened a new chapter in my life
