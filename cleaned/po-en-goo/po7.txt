i lay on my back  with her head on my shoulder  without a single thought  the darkness filling the room was populating  i heard footsteps  the walls disappeared  something was towering over me  higher and higher  limitless  penetrated through  embraced without touch  i froze in the darkness  i felt its transparency  sharp  displacing the air  very far away  i heard a heart  i focused all my attention  the rest of my strength on waiting for the agony  it didnt come  i just kept getting smaller  and the invisible sky  invisible horizons  space  shapeless  cloudless  starless  receding and huge  made me its center  i tried to crawl into what i was lying on  but there was nothing below me and the darkness no longer covered anything  appliances  shelves  corners of the walls traced out as if in broad  matte strokes  only contoured  no color of their own  the brightest pearly white in the silence outside the window  my body was wet with sweat  i looked to the side  she was looking at me   does your arm hurt    what   she lifted her head  her eyes were the same color as the room  gray  luminous between black lashes  i felt the warmth of her whisper before i understood the words   no  oh  yes  i put my hand on her shoulder  the touch tingled  i took it with my other hand    you had a bad dream    sleep  yes  sleep  and you havent been sleeping    i do not know  may not  im not sleepy  but you sleep  why are you looking like that  i closed my eyes  i could feel the small  steady beating of her heart where mine was beating slower  a prop  i thought  but nothing surprised me  not even my own indifference  i was past my fear and despair  i was farther  oh  so far no one was yet  i touched her neck with my lips and went down  into a small  shell smooth hollow between the tendons  and here was the heartbeat  i got up on my elbow  no aurora  no softness of dawn  the horizon was covered with an electric blue glow  the first beam shot through the room like a shot  everything played with reflections  the rainbow reflections in the mirror  in the doorknobs  in the nickel pipes  it seemed that the light hit every surface it met  as if wanted to break free  to blow up the cramped room  it was no longer possible to watch  i turned around  hareys pupils dimmed  gray eyes lifted up to my face    is it time for the day yet  she asked in a dull voice  it was like half a dream  half awake    its always like this  honey    and us    what we    will we be here long  i wanted to laugh  but when the faint noise escaped my chest  it was nothing like laughter    i think quite a long time  you do not want  her eyelids did not twitch  she looked at me carefully  did she blink  i wasnt sure  she pulled up the blanket and a small  triangular birthmark turned pink on her arm    why are you looking like that    because youre beautiful  she smiled  but it was just a courtesy  thanks for the compliment    really  cause you look like youre    like im      what    as if you were looking for something    youre talking   not as if you think theres something wrong with me or that i havent told you something     of course not   if thats what youre denying  sure   but as you like  behind the blazing windows  a dead blue heat was born  shading my eyes with my hand  i fumbled for my glasses  they were on the table  i knelt on the bed  put them on  and saw her reflection in the mirror  she was expecting something  when i lay down next to her again  she smiled    and for me  suddenly i understood    glasses  i got up and rummaged through the drawers on the table by the window  i found two pairs  both too big  i handed it to her  she tried both  it fell halfway down her nose  with a long creaking  the window covers began to slide shut  a moment and inside the station  which like a turtle hid in its shell  night reigned  i groped her and took off her glasses and placed them under the bed with mine    what will we do  she asked    what you do at night  sleep    kris    what    maybe ill make you a new wrap    no  you dont have to  no need    honey  when i said this  i myself did not understand if i was pretending  but suddenly in the darkness i embraced her slender back blindly and  feeling it trembling  believed in her  anyway  i dont know  it suddenly seemed to me that i was deceiving her  and not she me  because she was only herself  i fell asleep a few more times after that  and still the spasm woke me from my doze  my pounding heart slowly calmed down  i pressed her to me  dead tired  she touched my face  my forehead  very carefully  checking if i had a fever  it was harry  there could be no other truer  after that thought  something changed in me  i stopped fighting  i fell asleep almost immediately  a gentle touch woke me up  there was a nice coolness on his forehead  i lay with my face covered in something moist and soft that rose slowly  i looked into hareys face bent over me  with both hands  she squeezed excess liquid from the gauze into a china bowl  beside it was a bottle of anti scald liquid  she smiled at me   what a dream you have   she said  and putting the gauze back on   does it hurt     no  i moved the skin of my forehead  indeed  the burns did not bother me now  harey was sitting on the edge of the bed  wrapped in a mens bathrobe  white with orange stripes  black hair spilled over the collar  her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows so they wouldnt get in the way  i felt incredibly hungry  i must have had nothing to eat in twenty hours  when harey finished my facial  i stood up  my gaze suddenly fell on two identical white dresses with red buttons lying side by side  the first i had helped her take off by cutting the neckline  and the second she had come in yesterday  this time she unraveled the seam herself with scissors  she said the lock was jammed  those two identical dresses were the scariest thing ive ever experienced  harey was bustling around the medicine cabinet  tidying it up  i surreptitiously turned away from her and bit my fist bloody  still looking at the two dresses   or rather one and the same dress repeated twice   i started backing towards the door  the water was still dripping from the tap  making a noise  i opened the door  slipped quietly into the corridor  and closed it carefully  i heard the faint murmur of running water and the clinking of bottles  then suddenly the sound ceased  in the corridor  oblong ceiling lamps burned  a dim patch of reflected light lay on the surface of the door where i waited with clenched jaws  i held the doorknob  though i didnt expect to be able to hold it  a violent yank nearly ripped it out of my hand  but the door didnt open  just shuddered and creaked horribly  stunned  i let go of the handle and stepped back  something incredible was happening to the door  its smooth plastic plate bending as if forced from my side into the room  the enamel began to chip away in tiny shards  exposing the steel of the door frame  which grew more and more taut  suddenly i understood  instead of pushing the door that opened into the corridor  she was trying to open it by pulling it towards her  the reflection of light curved on the white sheet as in a concave mirror  there was a powerful crunch and a uniform  curved sheet cracked  at the same time  the doorknob  torn from the mount  flew into the room  immediately bloody hands appeared in the opening and  leaving red marks on the paintwork  they continued   the door panel broke in two  hanging diagonally from its hinges  and an orange and white creature with a blue  dead face threw itself on my chest  weeping  if the sight hadnt paralyzed me  i probably would have tried to escape  harey gasped convulsively  banging her head against my shoulder  her hair flying wildly  as i hugged her  i felt her slipping through my hands  i carried her into the room  squeezing past the shattered door leaf  and laid her on the bed  her fingernails were wet with blood and broken  when she turned her hand away  i saw the inside of her hand raw flesh  i looked at her face  open eyes looking through me  expressionless    harry  she replied with an inarticulate grunt  i brought my finger to her eye  the eyelid closed  i walked over to the medicine cabinet  the bed creaked  i turned around  she sat up straight  looking fearfully at her bloody hands   kris   she moaned   i    i    what happened to me    you cut yourself breaking the door   i said dryly  i had something in my lips  especially the lower one  as if ants were walking on it  i clenched it with my teeth  harey stared at the jagged pieces of plastic hanging loosely from the frame for a moment  then turned her eyes back to me  her chin twitched  and i saw the effort she was making to control her fear  i cut up the sheets of gauze  took some wound powder from the cupboard  and went back to bed  everything i was carrying suddenly slipped from my lowered hands  the glass jar with its gelatin membrane burst  but i didnt even bend over  he was no longer needed  i raised her hand  dried blood still fringed the fingernails thinly  but the bruises were gone  and the palms of the hands were sealed with young  pink skin that was brighter than the surrounding area  the scar had almost faded before the eyes  i sat down  stroked her face  and tried to smile at her  cant say i succeeded    why did you do it  harry    no  its me  her eyes pointed to the door    yes  you do not remember    no  i mean  i saw you were gone  i got really scared and      so what    i started looking for you  i thought maybe you were in the bathroom    only now i noticed that the wardrobe  pushed aside  shows the entrance to the bathroom    and then    i ran to the door    and what    i dont remember  something must have happened    what    i do not know    what do you remember  what happened next    i was sitting here on the bed    and how i brought you  dont you remember  she hesitated  the corners of her mouth turned down  her face tense    seems to  maybe  i do not know  she swung her legs to the floor and stood up  she walked over to the shattered door    kris  i took her by the shoulders from behind  she was trembling  suddenly she turned around  looking for my eyes   kris   she whispered   kris    calm down    kris  if  kris  do i have epilepsy  epilepsy  good god  i wanted to laugh    where is it  honey  just a door  you know  theres this  well  this door    we left the room as the outer armor with a long creak opened the windows  revealing the suns disk sinking into the ocean  i headed for the small kitchen area at the far end of the hall  harey and i farmed together  rummaging cupboards and refrigerators  i soon noticed that she wasnt very good at cooking  and could do little more than open cans of tinned food  which is as much as i do  i devoured the contents of two such cans and drank countless cups of coffee  harey also ate  but as children sometimes do  not wanting to upset the adults  not even with compulsion  but mechanically and indifferently  we then went to a small operating room next to the radio station  i had a plan  i said i wanted to examine her just in case  sat her down on the reclining chair and took the syringe and needles out of the sterilizer  i knew where everything was almost by heart  thats how wed been drilled in the training copy of the station on earth  i took a drop of blood from her finger  made a smear  dried it in an exhaust hood  and dusted it with silver ions in a high vacuum  the matter of factness of the job was reassuring  harey  reclining on the cushions of a reclining chair  looked around the camera crowded operating room  the silence was broken by the intermittent beeper of the internal telephone  i picked up the handset   kelvin   i said  i kept my eyes on harey  who had been apathetic for some time  as if exhausted by the experiences of the last hours    are you in surgery  at last  i heard a sigh of relief  snaut was speaking  i waited with the receiver pressed to my ear   youve got a visitor  huh    yes    and youre busy    yes   with us    thats new   i replied  surprised   what about     i trailed off and finished   is he alone    no  i worded it wrong  he wants to talk to us  screens will be blanked out    oh yeah  then why didnt he call me directly  is he ashamed    something like that   snaut muttered vaguely   so how   okay  i saw him on the screen  just a face no bigger than the palm of my hand  for a moment marked by the slight hum of the current  he looked me in the eye searchingly  then he said  with some hesitation   how are you doing    tolerable  how are you    a little worse than you  i suppose  could i      do you want to come see me   i guessed  i looked over my shoulder at harey  and with his leg crossed  tossing with a gesture of unconscious boredom the silvery ball that ended the chain on the arm of the chair    leave it  do you hear  stay  you  snauts raised voice reached me  i saw his profile on the screen  i couldnt hear the rest  he covered the microphone with his hand  but i saw his mouth moving    no  i cant come  maybe later  so in an hour  he said quickly  and the screen went blank  i hung up the receiver    who it was  harey asked indifferently    such one  snout  cybernetic  you do not know him    how long will it take    what  are you bored  i asked  i loaded the first of a series of slides into the neutrino microscope cassette and pressed the colored knobs of the switches in turn  the force fields buzzed dully   there are not many amusements here  and if my modest company is not enough for you  it will be difficult   i said  absentmindedly extending the pauses between words  at the same time i pulled off with both hands the great black head in which the microscope eyepiece shone  and pushed my eyes deep into the soft rubber shell   harey said something i didnt get  i saw from above  in a sharp foreshortening  a huge desert  flooded with a silver glow  on it lay  surrounded by a dim haze  as if broken and weathered  flat round rocks  they were red cells  i sharpened the image and  without taking my eyes off my glasses  i seemed to float deeper and deeper into the blazing silvery field of vision  at the same time  with my left hand  i turned the adjusting crank of the stage  and when the blood cell  lying alone like an erratic boulder  was at the intersection of black threads  i increased the magnification  the lens seemed to move over a distorted erythrocyte  sunken in the middle  which already seemed to be the ring of a rock crater  with black  sharp shadows in the hollows of the annular rim  this rim  bristling with crystallized deposits of silver ions  escaped me beyond the limits of the microscopic field  there were dim  as if seen through iridescent water  outlines of half melted  twisted chains of protein  with one knot of protein ruins at the black junction  i slowly pushed the zoom lever farther and farther  at any moment the end of this journey into the depths would be revealed  the flattened shadow of one molecule filled the whole picture  blurred now  but nothing happened  i should have seen atoms vibrating like a gelatinous quake  but there werent any  the screen burned immaculate silver  i pushed the lever all the way  the hum intensified angrily  but i still couldnt see anything  a repeated  buzzing signal let me know that the apparatus was overloaded  i looked once more into the silver void and turned off the power  i looked at harry  she opened her mouth in a yawn  which she deftly turned into a smile    hows me  she asked   very well   i said    i think    it couldnt be better  i kept looking at her  feeling that ant in my lower lip again  what actually happened  what did it mean  this body  seemingly so limp and fragile   in fact indestructible   in its final days turned out to be composed of nothingness  i hit the cylindrical body of the microscope with my fist  maybe some defect  maybe the fields dont focus     no  i knew the apparatus was operational  i went down all the levels  the cell  the protein conglomerate  the molecules  they all looked exactly like they did on the thousands of slides id seen  but the last step down led nowhere  i took her blood from a vein and poured it into a measuring cylinder  i divided it into portions and set about analyzing it  it took me longer than i thought  i lost some practice  reactions were normal  all  unless    i dropped a drop of concentrated acid on the red bead  it was smoky  the drop turned grey  covered with a layer of dirty foam  schedule  denaturation  go on  i reached for a test tube  when i turned to the other  the thin glass nearly fell from my fingers  under the layer of dirty scum at the very bottom of the tube  a layer of dark red was growing again  the blood  burnt with acid  was recreating itself  it was nonsense  it was impossible    kris  i heard it from a great distance    phone  chris    what  oh yes  thank you  the phone has been ringing for a long time  i just heard it now   kelvin   i picked up the phone    snaut  i switched the line so we can hear each other at the same time   hello  dr  kelvin   sartoriuss high  nasal voice said  it sounded as if its owner was stepping onto a dangerously bending podium  suspicious  alert  and outwardly composed   my respects  doctor   i replied  i wanted to laugh  but i wasnt sure if the reasons for this hilarity were clear enough for me to indulge in it  who was i supposed to laugh at  i was holding something in my hand  a blood tube  i shook her  shes already clotted  maybe it was just an illusion a moment ago  maybe i just imagined it    i wanted to present to my colleagues some issues related to     e     phantoms   i heard and did not hear sartorius at the same time  as if it was hitting my consciousness  i defended myself against that voice  still staring at the test tube with the clotted blood   lets call them f creatures   snaut submitted quickly    perfect  there was a dark vertical line in the middle of the screen to indicate that i was receiving two channels at the same time   on either side of it should have been the faces of my interlocutors  the glass was dark  however  and only a narrow band of light along the bezel indicated that the apparatus was working  but the screens were blocked by something   each of us conducted various tests     the same caution in the speakers nasal voice again  a moment of silence   maybe well combine our messages first  and then i could say what ive come up with personally    maybe you first  dr  kelvin      me     i said  suddenly i felt harrys eyes  i placed the test tube on the table so that it rolled under the racks of glass  and sat on the high tripod  dragging it with my foot  at first i wanted to excuse myself  but all of a sudden i said   all right  a small seminar  okay  ive done next to nothing  but i can speak  one histology slide and a couple of reactions  micro reactions  i got the impression that    until then  i had no idea what to say  it was as if something had opened up in me    everything is normal  but its camouflage  mask  it is  in a sense  a supercopy  a reproduction that is more accurate than the original  this means that where in humans we encounter the end of granularity  the end of structural divisibility  there is a further way here thanks to the use of the sub atomic building blocks    in a second  in a second  how do you understand it  asked sartorius  snaut didnt answer  or was it his rapid breathing echoing through the earpiece  harley looked over at me  i realized in my own excitement  i almost shouted the last words  coming to my senses  i slouched on my uncomfortable stool and closed my eyes  how to express it    the ultimate building block of our bodies are atoms  i suppose that the formations of f are made of units smaller than ordinary atoms  far smaller    from mesons     sartorius suggested  he wasnt surprised at all    no  not mesons    mesons would be visible  the resolution of this apparatus down here is ten to minus 20 angstroem  truth  but you cant see anything until the end  so not mesons  probably a neutrino    how do you imagine it  because neutrino conglomerates are not permanent      i dont know  im not a physicist  perhaps they are stabilized by some force field  i dont know about it  in any case  if it is as i say  the building blocks are particles about ten thousand times smaller than atoms  but thats not all  if protein molecules and cells were built directly from these  microatoms   they would have to be correspondingly smaller  blood cells  ferments  everything  but they are not  it follows that all proteins  cells  cell nuclei are just a mask  the actual structure responsible for the functioning of the  guest  is hidden deeper    why  kelvin  snaut almost shouted  i stopped  terrified  did i say  visitor    yes  but harey didnt hear it  she wouldnt have understood anyway  she stared out the window  her head resting on her hand  her small  clean profile outlined against the purple aurora  the receiver was silent  all i could hear was distant breathing   yes  its possible   sartorius added   only we have the snag that the ocean isnt made of these hypothetical kelvin particles  its made of ordinary particles    maybe it can synthesize and such   i remarked  the conversation wasnt even funny  it wasnt necessary   but that would explain the extraordinary stamina   snaut muttered   and the rate of regeneration  maybe even the energy source is down there  they dont need to eat      speak up  please   he said  sartorius  i hated him  if only he hadnt fallen out of his self imposed role   i want to raise the issue of motivation  the motivation behind the emergence of f creations  i would break it down like this  what are f creations  they are not persons or copies of specific persons  you only materialized projections of what our brain contains about the person  the accuracy of the term struck me  this sartorius  however unpleasant  was not stupid   thats good   i interjected    it even explains why the personas of this     and not others appeared  the most durable traces of memory  the most isolated from all others  have been selected  although  naturally  no such trace can be completely isolated  and in the process of  copying  it  the remnants of other traces  which happen to be nearby  may have been taken  as a result of which the visitor sometimes shows more knowledge than the genuine person he was supposed to imitate could have possessed     kelvin   that his  guest  is inherently less bright than snauts  guest   motivation for the emergence of the creations f    the first  somewhat natural  is the thought of an experiment conducted on us  but it would be a rather    poor experiment  if we fail  we learn from the results  above all from mistakes  so that we make corrections in its repetitions     meanwhile  there is no mention of it  the same f creations reappear    uncorrected    not armed against our    attempts to get rid of them     in other words  theres no corrective feedback loop as dr  snaut   i noticed    and the results of this is  except that for an experiment  it would be    a botch  otherwise improbable  the ocean is    precise  this is manifested  for example  in the two layer construction of f formations  up to a certain limit  they behave as if     real     real     he could not get out   originals   snaut prompted    yes  the originals  but when the situation exceeds the normal capabilities of the average     er     original  there is a sort of  awareness shutdown  of the creature f  and another action  inhuman  is manifested directly      im not so sure   protested sartorius  suddenly i understood what he was irritating me about  he didnt speak  but he spoke  just like at an institute meeting   this is where individuality comes into play  the ocean is completely devoid of its notion  it must be so  it seems to me  my colleagues  that this for us     uh     most sensitive  shocking side of the experiment completely eludes him as lying beyond his comprehension    you dont think its intentional      i asked  the claim stunned me a bit  but on reflection i admitted that it couldnt be ruled out   yes  i dont believe in any perfidy  malice  desire to the most severe hit    as colleague snaut does   i dont attribute human feelings to him at all   snaut spoke for the first time   but can you tell me how you try to explain these constant returns    maybe they set up some device that runs over and over again  like a gramophone record   i said  not without a hidden desire to tease sartorius   comrades  please  lets not get distracted   the doctor said nasally    thats not all i wanted to say  normally  i would consider it premature to submit even a provisional report on the state of my work  but due to the specificity of the situation  i will make an exception  i have the impression  i repeat  i have the impression  no more for the time being  that there is truth in the supposition of colleague kelvin  i mean his hypothesis of a neutrino structure    we know such systems only theoretically  we didnt know that they could be stabilized  there is a definite chance here  for the destruction of that force field that makes the system permanent    for some time now  i have noticed that the dark thing that covered the screen on the sartorius side is moving  a crack lit up at the very top  and you could see something pink that was slowly moving there  now the dark plane slid suddenly    away  away    sartorius scream echoed through the receiver  in the suddenly brightened screen  between the doctors struggling hands  clad in puffed sleeves  such as are used in laboratories  a large  golden disc like object shone  and everything went out before i could even comprehend that the golden circle was a straw hat       snaut  i said taking a deep breath   yes  kelvin   replied the weary voice of the cyberneticist  i felt at that moment that i liked him  i really didnt want to know who was with him  weve had enough for now  havent we   i think so   i replied   look  if you could  come downstairs or into my cabin  okay   i added hastily so that he didnt have time to hang up the phone   all right   he said    but i do not know when  and that was the end of the problematic discussion
