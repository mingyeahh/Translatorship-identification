a light woke me up in the middle of the night  i propped myself up on one elbow  shielding my eyes with the other hand  harey  wrapped in a sheet  sat at the foot of the bed  curled up  her face covered in hair  her shoulders trembled  she cried without making a sound    harry  she curled up even more    what about you     harey    i sat on the bed  not quite conscious yet  freeing myself slowly from the nightmare that had choked me a moment ago  the girl was trembling  i embraced her  she elbowed me away  she hid her face    sweetheart    do not say that    but  harey  whats going on  i saw her wet  trembling face  thick  childish tears rolled down her cheeks  glistened in the dimple above her chin  dripped onto the sheet    you do not want me    whats on your mind    i heard  i felt my whole face go stiff    what did you hear  you didnt understand  it was just      no  no  you said it wasnt me  for me to go  i would  god  i would go  but i cant  i do not know what is it  i wanted to and i cant  im so  so mean    kid    i grabbed her  pressed her against me with all my strength  everything was falling apart  kissed her hands  wet and salty fingers  repeated some spells  oaths  apologized  told her it was a stupid  disgusting dream  she slowly calmed down  she stopped crying  her eyes were huge  sleepwalking  dried up  she turned  head   no   she said   dont say that  you dont have to  youre not the same for me      im not  it came out like a groan    yes  you do not want me  i still felt it  i pretended not to see  i thought maybe i was imagining it or something  but no  you act    differently  you do not treat me seriously  it was a dream  true  but i dreamed of you  you spoke to me by name  you were disgusted  why  why   i knelt in front of her and hugged her knees    baby      i dont want you to say that  i dont want to  do you hear  i am no child  im    she burst into sobs and fell facedown on the bed  i got up  cool air whirred from the vents  i was cold  i put on my bathrobe  sat on the bed and touched her arm    harry  listen  i will tell you something  ill tell you the truth    she sat down  leaning slowly on her hands  i could see the pulses pounding under the thin skin of her neck  my face was numb again  and i felt so cold  as if i were standing in the cold  my mind was completely blank    truth    she said    holy word  i didnt answer right away  i had to fight back a spasm in my throat  it was our old spell  when it came down  none of us dared not only to lie  but even to keep silent about anything  there was a time when we tormented ourselves with excessive honesty  in the naive belief that he would save us   holy word   i said seriously    harley    she waited    youve changed too  we all change  but thats not what i wanted to say  the truth is    that for reasons we both dont know exactly    you cant leave me  but thats actually a good thing  because i cant you either      kris  i lifted her  wrapped in a sheet  the horn  wet with tears  rested on my shoulder  i walked around the room and rocked her  she stroked my face    no  you havent changed  its me   she whispered in my ear    theres something with me  maybe this  she stared at the black  empty rectangle of the shattered door  the remains of which i had taken to the warehouse that evening  ill have to hang a new one  i thought  i put her on the bed    do you sleep at all  i asked  standing over her with my hands down    i do not know    how do you not know  stop  honey    i dont think this is a real dream  maybe im sick  im just lying there thinking  and you know    she shivered    what  i asked in a whisper  my voice might have failed me  these are very strange thoughts  i dont know where they come from    for example  i need to be calm  i thought  no matter what i hear  and braced myself for her words to be dealt a heavy blow  she shook her head helplessly    its kind of    around      i dont understand       as if not only in me  but further  somehow  i cant tell  there are no words for this      it must be dreams   i said casually and sighed   and now well turn off the light and well have no worries until morning  and in the morning  if we want  well get a new one   okay  she reached for the switch  and darkness fell  and i lay down on the cold sheets and felt the warmth of her approaching breath  i embraced her   harder   she whispered  and after a long time    kris    what    i love you  i wanted to scream  the morning was red  the swollen disk of the sun stood low on the horizon  there was a letter on the doorstep  i tore open the envelope  ha rey was in the bathroom  i heard her humming  from time to time she peeked out from there  plastered with wet hair  i went to the window and read   kelvin  were stuck  sartorius is for vigorous action  he believes he can destabilize neutrino systems  he needs a certain amount of plasma for his experiments as the starting material of f  i suggest you go on a reconnaissance and get some plasma into a reservoir  use it at your discretion  but let me know your decision  i have no opinion  i dont seem to have anything anymore  id rather you just do it because were going to be moving  even if only superficially  otherwise  there is only envy g  szczur ps  dont go to the radio station  you can still do that for me  my heart sank as i read that letter  i looked it over carefully  tore it up  and threw the shreds into the sink  then i started looking for a jumpsuit for harey  that was already terrible  just like last time  but she didnt know anything otherwise she wouldnt have been so pleased when i told her i had to do a little scouting outside the station and ask her to accompany me we ate breakfast in the small kitchen  with harey barely swallowing a few bites again  and went to the library  look at the literature on field problems and neutrino systems before doing what sartorius wants  i didnt know how i was going to go about it yet  but i decided to keep his work under control  and sartorius  and i would wait out the  operation  with harey somewhere outside   on an airplane  for example  i pored over a large electronic catalog for a while  asking him a question  which he either answered by throwing out a flashcard with the terse word  not in bibliography   or he suggested venturing into such a jungle of specialized physical work that i didnt know what to make of it  somehow i wanted to leave this great  round room with smooth walls  gridded drawers filled with microfilms and electronic records  located in the center of the station  the library had no windows and was the best insulated place inside a steel shell  despite the evident fiasco of the search  i wandered around the great hall until i stood before a huge  ceiling high bookcase full of books  not so much a luxury  at least a dubious one  as a tribute to and respect for the pioneers of solarias exploration  shelves  numbering about six hundred volumes  carried the entire classics of the subject  starting with the monumental  though largely in the outdated nine volume monograph of giese  i took out those volumes  from the weight of which my hand immediately hung  and leafed through them casually  perched on the arm of the chair  harey found a book too   i read a few lines of print over her shoulder  it was one of the few books that belonged to the first voyage  probably once owned by giese himself    interplanetary cook      i said nothing  seeing hareys intent study of recipes adapted to the rigors of space exploration  and returned to my venerable  ten years of solaris research  came out in the solariana series as items four through thirteen  whereas the current ones have four figure numbers  perhaps the imagination and the ability to make hasty hypotheses dont become so fatal after all  anything is possible on this planet the unbelievable sounding descriptions of the constellations that plasma creates are in all likelihood genuine  though generally unverifiable  for the ocean seldom repeats its evolution  observing them for the first time  they terrify mainly with their strangeness and enormity  if they appeared in a small size scale  in a puddle  it would probably be considered just another  freak of nature   a manifestation of randomness and blind power play  the fact that mediocrity and genius become equally helpless in the face of the inexhaustible variety of solar forms does not make it easier to commune with the phenomena of the living ocean either  giese was neither one nor the other  he was simply a pedant classifier  the kind whose outward calm hides the life consuming  tireless ferocity of his work  as long as he could  he simply used the language of description  and when words failed him  he coped by creating new words  often unfortunate  incompatible with the described phenomena  but in the end  no terms can do justice to whats happening on solaris  his  mountains   his  longwoods    mushrooms    mimoids    sym triads  and  asymtriads    streptococci  and  swift  sound wildly artificial  but they give some idea of solaris even to those who blurred photographs and imperfect videos they saw nothing  of course  this conscientious classifier has sinned with more than one carelessness  man makes hypotheses all the time  even when hes on his guard  even when he doesnt know it  giese believed that  longs  constituted the basic form  and compared it with the many times enlarged and piled up tidal waves of the terrestrial seas  anyone who dug in the first edition of his work knows that he originally called them  tides   inspired by geocentrism  which would be funny if not for his helplessness  after all  if we are to look for comparisons on earth  these are formations larger than the grand canyon of colorado  modeled in a material that has a gelatinous foamy consistency on the top  with this foam congealing into huge  easily crumbling festoons  into laces eyes  and even to some researchers it presented itself as  skeleton like growths     and in the depths it changes into a substance that is more and more firm  like a tense muscle  but a muscle that soon exceeds  at a depth of several meters  the hardness of a boulder  although still retaining its elasticity between the walls tense like a membrane on the monsters back  to which the  skeletons  cling  stretches for miles the proper  length   a seemingly independent creation  like some colossal python that has eaten whole mountains and is now digesting them in silence  since time immemorial  for a while  putting his fish like body into slow  quivering movements  but this is what the  long  looks like only from above  from the deck of a flying machine  when approached  until both  walls of the ravine  rise hundreds of meters above the plane  the  pythons body  is a stretched out horizon of motion so vertiginous that it takes on the appearance of a passively swollen cylinder  the first impression is a swirl of slippery  grey greenish goo  which in piles rejects strong flashes of the sun  but when the machine hovers just above the surface  and the edges of the  ravine  hiding the  long  become  as it were  peaks on both sides of a geological depression    you can see that the movement is much more complicated  it has concentric circuits  darker streams intersect in it  and at times the outer  mantle  becomes a mirror surface reflecting the sky and clouds  pierced with the roar of gunshots by eruptions of a gaseous  semi liquid medium  one has the center of action of the forces that keep the flanks of sluggishly crystallizing jelly stretched sideways  skyward  but what is obvious to the eye is not so readily understood by science  within the  long legs  that plow the vastness of the living ocean by millions  it was thought that they were some kind of monsters organs  that metabolism  respiratory processes  transport of nutrients took place in them  and only dusty libraries knew what else  each hypothesis was finally refuted by a thousand tedious and sometimes dangerous experiments  and all this applies only to the  longs   the form that is basically the simplest  the most durable  because their existence is counted in weeks   a quite unique thing here  reflexive   there are  mimoids   it can be said without exaggeration that giese loved them and devoted himself to studying them  describing them  guessing their essence  with the name  he tried to convey what is most peculiar about them for man  a certain tendency to imitate the surrounding forms  no matter whether they are close or distant  one day  deep below the surface of the ocean  a flat  wide circle begins to darken  with jagged edges and a tar like surface  after a dozen or so hours  it becomes layered  reveals more and more distinct dismemberments  and at the same time breaks through upwards  towards the surface  the observer would swear there was a violent struggle going on below him  for from all around converged here like contracting lips  like living  muscular  closing craters  endless ranks of concurrent circular waves heaped over the spilled blackish  tossing delirious and  rearing up  they fall down  each such fall of hundreds of thousands of tons is accompanied for seconds by a stretched  sticky  clattering  one would like to say  thunder  because here everything happens on a monstrous scale  the dark thing is pushed down  each successive blow seems to flatten and split it  from individual lobes that hang down like wet wings  long clusters separate  narrow into long necklaces  fuse with each other and flow upward  as if carrying they are attached to them by the cavalised mother shield  and meanwhile from above they constantly fall into the ever more distinctly collapsing ring of successive rings of waves  and this game goes on sometimes a day  sometimes a month  sometimes it all ends there  conscientious giese called this variant the  abortive mimoid   as if he knew from some unknown source that the ultimate goal of any such cataclysm was the  mature mimoid   that is  that colony of polypous  light skinned growths  usually larger than an earthly city  whose the destiny is to ape external shapes    of course  there was also another solarist named uyvens  who considered this last phase to be  degenerative   as degeneration  dying  and the forest of created shapes as an obvious manifestation of the liberation of detached creations from the dominion of the matrix  however  giese  who in all descriptions of other solar formations behaves like an ant walking on a frozen waterfall  not allowing himself to be disturbed by anything from the measured step of his dry phrase  was so sure of himself that he arranged the individual phases of the emergence of the mimoid in a sequence of increasing perfection  from above  the mimoid seems to resemble a city  but this is an illusion caused by pos searching for any analogy among the known  when the sky is clear  all the high rises and their top palisades are surrounded by a layer of heated air  causing shapes that are already difficult to pinpoint to seem to sway and sag  the first cloud gliding blue  i say this out of habit  because this  blue  is red to red  and terrifyingly white on a blue day  arouses an immediate response  a cauliflower like coating that fades at the same time and after a few minutes imitates a cumulus cloud  this huge object casts a reddish shadow  one peak of the mimoid seems to follow another  the movement is always in the opposite direction to the movement of the real cloud  i think giese would give himself he would probably cut off his hand to find out at least why this is so  but such  solitary  products of the mimoid are nothing compared to the exuberant activity of being  excited  by the presence of objects and shapes that appear above him due to terrestrial visitors  reproduction of forms includes  in fact  everything that comes within a distance of eight   nine miles  most often  the mimoid produces an enlarged reproduction  sometimes distorting it  creating caricatures or grotesque simplifications  especially of machines  obviously  the material is always the same  rapidly fading mass  which  thrown into the air  instead of falling  hangs  united by easily tearing umbilical cords with the ground  on which it moves crawling  and at the same time  shrinking  constricting or swelling  arranges smoothly into the most intricate patterns  an airplane  a truss or a mast are reproduced with equal speed  mimoid does not react only to people themselves  and strictly speaking to any living beings  including plants  because these were brought to solaris for experimental purposes by tireless researchers  on the other hand  a dummy  a human effigy  a statue of a dog or a tree carved from any material is copied immediately  and here  unfortunately  it should be noted in parentheses that this  obedience  of the mimoid towards the experimenters  so exceptional on solaris  is sometimes suspended  the most mature mimoid experiences its  lazy days   during which it only pulses very slowly  this pulsation is not perceptible to the eye anyway  its rhythm  a single phase of  pulse  lasts over two hours  and it took special film shots to discover it  in such circumstances  the mimoid  especially the old one  is perfect for sightseeing  because submerged in the ocean  as well as the formations raised from it  give the foot more than enough support  of course  one can stay within the mimoid also during its  busy  days  but then the visibility is close to zero  due to the constant fall of the fluffy suspension  whitish as ground snow colloidal  which is constantly pouring from the swollen branches of the abdomen  which copies the forms  these forms  moreover  cannot be grasped from close up  due to their immensity on the scale of mountains  moreover  the ground of the  working  mimoid becomes muddy from the fleshy rain  which is cut into a hard crust  many times lighter than pumice  only after a dozen or so hours  they are semi liquid geysers  even in full sun  because its rays cannot penetrate the cover of  imitating explosions  constantly thrown into the atmosphere  observing the mimoid in its happy days  these are  more precisely  the happy days of the researcher above it  can be a source of indelible impressions  he has his  creative highs  when he starts an amazing hyperproduction  then he creates either his own variants of external forms  or their complications or even  formal continuations   and in this way he can amuse himself for hours to the delight of an abstract painter and to the despair of a scholar who it is in vain to try to understand anything about the processes taking place  sometimes the mimoids activity shows features of almost childish simplification  sometimes it falls into the  baroque deviation   then everything it creates is marked with the mark of bloated ivory  old mimoids in particular fabricate shapes capable of making hearty laughs  to laugh at them  too shocked by the mystery of the spectacle of course  in the first years of research  the mimoids were rushed directly to the supposedly dreamed centers of the solarian ocean  as the places where the desired contact of the two civilizations would take place  however  there is no question of any contact  because everything begins and ends with the imitation of shapes  which leads nowhere  the anthropomorphism  constantly returning in the desperate searches of researchers  saw in ever different products of the living ocean  sensory organs  or even  sensory organs  limbs  for which scholars  like maartens and ekkonai  for a time took  streptococci  and gieses  chick   but these living assessment prominences  sometimes shooting up to two miles into the atmosphere  are as much  limbs  as an earthquake is the  gymnastics  of its crust  the catalog of forms repeating relatively constantly  generated by the living ocean so often that at least several dozen or several hundred can be discovered on its surface per day  includes about three hundred items  the most inhuman  in the sense of being absolutely unlike anything experienced by man on earth  are  according to gieses school  symmetriads  when it was already well known that the ocean does not behave aggressively and only those who take special care of it due to their own carelessness or thoughtlessness can die in its plasma depths  i am not  of course  talking about accidents caused by  for example  damage to the oxygen apparatus or air conditioner  that even cylindrical rivers of long rivers and monstrous pillars of streptococci wandering erratically among the clouds can be pierced through by an airplane or other flying machine without the slightest danger  the plasma gives way  parting before the foreign body with the speed of sound equal to the speed of sound in solarias atmosphere  opening  if forced to it  deep tunnels even under the surface of the ocean  and the energy it immediately releases for this purpose is enormous   scriabin calculated it in extreme cases at 1019 erg      the study of symmetriads was approached with extreme caution  with constant backtracking  multiplication of safeguards  although often fictitious  and the names of those who first ventured into their depths are known to every child on earth  the terror of these giants is not in their appearance  although they can really give you nightmares  rather  it comes from the fact that there is nothing permanent or certain within them  even physical laws are suspended in them  it was the researchers of symmetriads who always repeated the thesis that the living ocean is intelligent  symmetriads arise suddenly  their birth is a kind of eruption  about an hour beforehand  the ocean begins to glow violently  as if glazed over several dozen square kilometers  apart from that  its fluidity and undulation rhythm do not change  sometimes a symmetriad breaks out where there was a crater after the slug sucked in  but this is not the rule  after an hour or so  the glistening coating bursts up in a monstrous bubble in which the entire sky  the sun  clouds  all horizons are reflected  shimmering and refracting  the lightning play of colors  caused partly by deflection and partly by refraction of light  is unparalleled  particularly violent lighting effects are produced by symmetriads formed during a blue day and just before sunset  then one has the impression that the planet is giving birth to a second one  doubling its volume with every moment  the blazing globe  barely launched from the depths  will burst at the top into vertical sectors  but this is not disintegration  this stage  not so fortunately called the  flower calyx phase   lasts seconds  the arches of membranous spans that point skyward turn around  interlock in an invisible interior  and begin to form instantly a kind of stocky torso within which hundreds of phenomena occur at once  investigated for the first time by the hamalei team of seventy  there is a giant  and poly crystallization that gives rise to an axial lifting pin  sometimes called a  spine   but i am not a proponent of this term  the breakneck architecture of this central support is sustained in statu nascendi by vertical pillars of jelly so rarefied as to be almost watery  gushing constantly from kilometer long hollows  in the process  the colossus utters a dull  drawn out roar  surrounded by a shaft of rapidly fluttering  snow covered  thick walled foam  then there are   from the center to the periphery   extremely complicated rotations of thickened planes  on which deposits of elastic material emanating from the depths are built up  while at the same time the deep sea geysers mentioned a moment ago transform  solidifying  into mobile tentacle like columns  their bunches heading towards a precisely defined direction  the dynamics of the whole to the places of the structure  resembling some sky high gills of a fetus growing with a thousandfold acceleration  through which flow streams of pink blood and water so dark green that it is almost black  from that moment  the symmetriad begins to manifest its most extraordinary property   modeling or even suspending certain physical laws  lets say first that no two symmetriads are alike  and that the geometry of each is like a new  invention  of the living ocean  further  the symmetriad produces within itself what are often called  momentary machines   although these creations are nothing like machines constructed by people  it is only about the relatively narrow and thus  mechanical  purposefulness of action  when the geysers emanating from the abyss become concentrated or swell into thick walled galleries and corridors running in all directions  and the  membranes  form a system of intersecting planes  overhangs  ceilings  the symmetriade justifies its name by the fact that each shape of winding flights  passages and ramps within one pole corresponds to a faithfully detailed arrangement at the opposite pole  after about twenty or thirty minutes  the giant begins its slow descent  sometimes after first tilting in the vertical axis by eight to twelve degrees  there are major symmetries and minor symmetries  but even dwarfs rise a good eight hundred meters above the horizon when submerged and are visible from a distance of several miles  it is safest to get inside just after equilibrium is reached  when the whole ceases to plunge into the living ocean  and at the same time returns to the exact vertical  the most appropriate point of penetration is the area just below the peak  the relatively smooth polar  cap  there is surrounded by an area riddled with teat like openings of internal chambers and conduits  the formation is  taken as a whole  a three dimensional expansion of some higher order equation  as we know  any equation can be expressed in the figurative language of higher geometry and a solid equivalent to it can be built  the symmetriad is  in this sense  a relative of lobaczewskis cones and negative riemannian curvatures  but a very distant relative because of its unimaginable complexity  the simplest  of course  was the thought that we had before us nothing more than a  mathematical machine  of the living ocean  a model of calculations made on its scale for an unknown purpose   but this fermont hypothesis and no one shares it anymore  it was certainly tempting   but the idea that with such titanic eruptions  each particle of which is constantly subjected to complicated formulas of great analysis  the living ocean discusses the issues of matter  cosmos  existence     could not be sustained  there are too many phenomena in the depths of the giant that cannot be reconciled with this simple  childishly naive  as some people want  image  there were many attempts to come up with an accessible model of the symmetry  to visualize it  the example of averian was quite popular  who put it like this  imagine an ancient earthly structure from the glory days of babylon  let it be made of a living  excitable and evolutionary substance  its architecture flows smoothly through a series of transitional phases  taking on the forms of greek and romanesque architecture before our eyes  then the columns begin to slenderize like stems  the vault loses its weight  evaporates  sharpens  the arches turn into steep parabolas  and finally break into soaring arches  the gothic thus created begins to mature and grow old  it flows into late forms  the hitherto austerity of a steep ascent  ascension is replaced by eruptions of orgiastic exuberance  baroque fruiting in excess grows before our eyes if we continue this sequence  constantly treating our changing creation as individual stages of living existence  we will finally come to the architecture of the cosmodromic era  at the same time perhaps getting closer to understanding what a symmetria is  but this comparison  however developed and enriched  there have been attempts to visualize it with the help of special models and film   remains something impotent at best  and at worst a evasion  if not simply a lie  because the symmetria is not like anything earthly  a man can grasp so few things at once  we only see what is happening in front of us  here and now  it is beyond his capacity to visualize the simultaneous multitude of processes  however interrelated  however even complementary  we experience this even with relatively simple phenomena  the fate of one man can mean a lot  the fate of several hundred is difficult to embrace  but the history of a thousand  a million  in fact  means nothing  the symmetriad is a million  no  a billion raised to a power  the unimaginable itself  what if  in the depths of some of its naves  which are ten times the space of the kronecker  we stand like ants clinging to the folds of the breathing vault  that we see the rise of gigantic planes  iridescent gray in the light of our flares  their interpenetration  softness and infallible perfection of the solution  which is only moment   because everything flows here   the content of this architecture is movement  focused and purposeful  we observe a fragment of the process  the vibration of one string in a symphony orchestra of supergiants  and not much of that  because we know   but we only know  without comprehension   that simultaneously above and below us  in the soaring abysses  beyond the limits of sight and imagination  millions and millions of simultaneous transformations are taking place  related to each other like notes with mathematical counterpoint  so someone called it a geometric symphony  but then we are deaf to it  here  to see anything really  you would have to run away  go back into some immense distance  but after all  everything in symmetry is the interior  multiplication  bursting with avalanches of births  constant shaping  with shaping being at the same time shaping  and no mimosa is so sensitive to touch how miles away from the place where we stand  a part of the symmetry separated by hundreds of storeys  to the changes that our place is experiencing  here  every momentary construction  with a beauty that finds fulfillment beyond the limits of sight  is a co constructor and conductor of all the others that share  and they  in turn  model it  a symphony   fine  but one that creates itself and chokes itself  the end of the symmetry is terrible  no one who saw him could resist the impression that he had witnessed a tragedy  if not a murder  after about two or three hours at the most   this explosive growth  reproduction and self generation never lasts   the living ocean attacks  this is what it looks like  the smooth surface ripples  the already quenched  foam covered surf begins to boil  concentric wave sequences rush from the horizon  the same muscular craters as those that assist the birth of the mimoid  but this time their size is incomparably larger  the undersea part of the symmetriad is squeezed  the colossus rises slowly  as if about to be thrown off the planet  the top layers of oceanic glia begin to activate  creep higher and higher  onto the side walls  coat them  solidify  brick up the openings  but all this is nothing compared to what is happening simultaneously in the depths  first  the form creating processes   the emergence of successive architectonics from each other   freeze for a short while  then undergo a rapid acceleration  movements so far  smooth permeations  folds  spreading of warps and vaults  regular so far and as sure as if they were to last for centuries  they start to run  the feeling that the colossus  in the face of imminent danger  begins to violently strive for some fulfillment becomes overwhelming  however  the more the speed of change increases  the more obvious becomes the horrible  disgusting metamorphosis of the building material itself and its dynamics  all the knocking down of wonderfully supple planes soften  flake  sag  stumbles begin to appear  unfinished forms  gargantuan  crippled  from the invisible depths comes a rising noise  a roar  air  expelled as in some agonal breath  rubbing against the narrowing straits  snoring and playing thunderously in passages  it stimulates the collapsing ceilings to creak like monstrous larynxes  stalactites of mucus  dead vocal strings  and the viewer is instantly overwhelmed  despite the most violent movement that is unleashing   after all  it is a movement of destruction   complete deadness  only the hurricane howling from the abyss  traversing it through thousands of shafts  supports  distends  the sky structure  which begins to flow downwards  collapse like a comb caught in flames  but here and there you can still see the last flutters  inert  detached from the rest of the movement  blind  weaker and weaker until constantly attacked from the outside  washed away  it collapses with the slowness of a mountain and disappears in the depths of foams  the same as those that accompanied its titanic rise  and what does it all mean  yes  what does that mean    i remember a school trip visiting the solarian institute in aden when i was gibarians assistant  and after passing through a side room of the library  the youth were ushered into the main room  the lions share of which is filled with microfilm cassettes  there are tiny fragments of the inside of symmetriads recorded on them  of course long gone  but there are more than ninety thousand of them  not photos  but whole spools  and then a fat  maybe fifteen year old girl with glasses  with a resolute and intelligent look  suddenly asked a question    and what is all this for     and in the awkward silence that followed  only the teacher looked sternly at her unruly pupil  none of the solarists  i was among them  found the answer  because symmetriads are unrepeatable and the phenomena occurring in them are unrepeatable  sometimes the air in them ceases to conduct sound  sometimes the refractive index increases or decreases  locally there are pulsating  rhythmic changes in gravity  as if the symmetry da had a beating gravitational heart  occasionally  researchers gyrocompasses begin to behave like madmen  layers of increased ionization appear and disappear  the enumeration could be continued  besides  if the mystery of the symmetriads is ever solved  there will still be asymmetrias    they arise similarly  only they have a different end  and nothing can be seen in them but quivering  blazing  flickering  all we know is that they harbor vertiginous processes at the limits of physically possible speeds  and they are also called  exaggerated quantum phenomena   their mathematical resemblance to certain models of the atom  however  is so fickle and fleeting that some consider them a side effect or even they live incomparably shorter than those  a dozen or so minutes  and their end is probably even more terrible  because in the wake of the hurricane that fills them and bursts them with hard  roaring air  liquid swells in them with hellish speed  boiling under the sheepskin of dirty foam and drowns everything  bubbling  hideous  then comes an explosion like a mud volcano  throwing up a matted column of debris that rains macerated debris for a long time on the restless surface of the ocean  to some membranous bone or cartilage  can be found floating on the waves many tens of kilometers beyond focus of the explosion  a separate group consists of formations that are completely separated from the living ocean for a shorter or longer time  which are much less frequent and more difficult to observe than those  their remains  found for the first time  were identified completely falsely  as it turned out much later  as the corpses of creatures living in the depths of the ocean  at times they seem to flee like strange  many winged birds from the trumpets of swifts chasing them  but this concept  taken from earth  once again becomes a wall  which cannot be surpassed  sometimes  but very rarely  on the rocky shores of the islands  you can see peculiar flightless seals lying in schools  resting in the sun or lazily crawling into the sea to merge with it  and so they kept turning in the circle of earthly  human concepts  and the first contact     expeditions traveled hundreds of kilometers in the depths of symmetries  set up recorders  automatic film cameras  the television eyes of the artificial satellites recorded the budding of mimoids and longpods  their maturation and death  libraries filled up  archives grew  the price that had to be paid for it became sometimes high  seven hundred and eighteen people died in the cataclysms without withdrawing in time from the already doomed colossi  one hundred and six of them in one catastrophe  famous because it also killed giese himself  then an old man of seventy  when the end  usually characteristic of asymmetries   unexpectedly met a formation that is clearly a symmetry  seventy nine people along with machines  apparatuses  dressed in armored suits  were engulfed in seconds by an explosion of muddy slime  attracting with their shootings twenty seven more  who were piloting planes and helicopters circling over the examined formation  this place  at the intersection of the forty second parallel and the eighty ninth meridian  is marked on maps as the hundred six eruption  but this point exists only on maps  for the surface of the ocean there is no different from all its other areas  at that time  for the first time in the history of solarian research  there were voices demanding the use of thermonuclear shocks  it was actually supposed to be crueler than revenge  it was about destroying what we cannot comprehend  tsanken  gieses second in command  only survived by mistake   the relay automaton had falsely marked the spot where they were studying the symmetria  so that tsanken was wandering in his machine over the ocean and arrived literally minutes after the explosion  flying  still seeing its black fungus   as the decision was being weighed  he threatened to blow up the station with himself and the eighteen others in it  and while it has never been officially acknowledged that this suicide ultimatum affected the outcome of the vote  it can be assumed that it did  but the days when such large scale expeditions haunted the planet are long gone  the station itself   its construction supervised by satellites  an engineering project of a scale that earth would have been proud of  had it not been for the fact that the ocean spawned structures a million times larger in seconds   was created in the form of a disc two hundred meters in diameter  with four storeys in the center and two on the periphery  suspended five hundred to fifteen hundred meters above the ocean  thanks to gravitors powered by the energy of annihilation  it was equipped  in addition to all the devices that ordinary stations and large satellites of other planets have  with special radar sensors  ready to activate additional power at the first change of ocean surface  so that the steel disc floats into the stratosphere as the first signs of the birth of a new living creature appear  now the station was virtually deserted  since the automatons were locked   for reasons still unknown to me   in the bottom warehouses  it was possible to go through the corridors without encountering anyone  as in a blind drifting wreck whose machines had survived the destruction of the crew  as i put the ninth volume of gieses monograph on the shelf  it seemed to me that the steel  hidden under a layer of fluffy foam plastic  trembled under my feet  i stilled  but the shaking didnt happen again  the library was perfectly isolated from the rest of the body  the vibrations could only have one cause  a rocket took off from the station  the thought brought me back to reality  i wasnt quite sure yet whether i would fly as sartorius had wished  by behaving as if i fully accepted his plans  the best i could do was delay the crisis  i was pretty sure there was going to be a fight because i decided to do what i could to save harey  the point is whether sartorius had a chance of success  his advantage over me was huge   as a physicist  he knew the problem ten times better than i did and i could only  paradoxically  count on the perfection of the solutions that the ocean offered us  for the next hour i pored over the microfilms  trying to pick out something comprehensible from the sea of infernal mathematics whose language was the physics of neutrino processes  at first it seemed hopeless to me  especially since there were five incredibly difficult theories of the neutrino field  a clear sign that none is perfect  and yet i managed to finally find something promising  i was just copying formulas when there was a knock  i walked quickly to the door and opened it  blocking the gap with my body  it revealed snauts face glistening with sweat  the corridor behind him was empty   oh  its you   i said  opening the door    come in   yes  its me   he replied  his voice was hoarse  there were bags under red eyes  he wore a shiny rubber anti radiation apron with elastic suspenders  the same dirty trousers he always wore poking out from under the apron  his eyes wandered around the round  evenly lit room and froze as he saw harey in the background standing next to the chair  we exchanged quick glances  i closed my eyes  then he bowed slightly  and i  getting into a sociable tone  said   this is dr  snaut  harey   snaut  this is     my wife   im    a very invisible member of the crew  and thats why     the pause lengthened dangerously  i havent had a chance to meet     harey smiled and offered him her hand  which he shook with what i thought was a little stunned  blinked he opened his eyes a few times and stood looking at her until i took his arm   im sorry   he said to her then   i wanted to talk to you  kelvin      of course   i replied with some great world ease  it all sounded like a cheesy comedy to me  but there was no help   harey  honey  dont disturb yourself  we need to talk to the doctor about our boring business    and i was already leading him by the elbow to the little seats on the opposite side of the room  harey sat down in the chair i had been sitting in  but she pushed him so far that she could see us when she looked up from her book    whats up  i asked quietly   im divorced   he replied in the same  only wheezy whisper  perhaps i would have laughed if i had ever been told that story and that conversation starter  but on the station my sense of humor was amputated   ive lived a few years since yesterday  kelvin   he added    a couple of good years  and you   nothing     i replied after a moment  because i didnt know what to say  i liked him  but i felt i had to be wary of him now  or rather of what he had come to me with    nothing  he repeated in the same tone as me    please  is it so       what do you mean  i pretended not to understand  he narrowed his bloodshot eyes and  leaning down so that i could feel the warmth of his breath on my face  he whispered   were sinking  kelvin   i cant get through to sartorius anymore  all i know is what i wrote to you  what he told me after our little lovely conference      turned off the visiphone  i asked    no  he has a short circuit there  looks like he did it on purpose or    he made a fist motion as if he was breaking something  i stared at him without saying a word  the left corner of his mouth turned up into an unpleasant smile    kelvin  i came because    he didnt finish    what are you going to do    you mean this letter     i replied slowly   i can do it  i see no reason to refuse  thats why im sitting here  i wanted to find out      no   he stopped    not that      no     i said feigning surprise    so im listening   sartorius   he muttered after a moment    he thinks hes found a way    you know  he didnt take his eyes off me  i sat quietly  trying to keep my face neutral    first theres the x ray thing  what gibarian did to him  you remember  some modification is possible      what   they just sent a beam of rays into the ocean and only modulated its intensity in various patterns    yes i know about it  nilin has already done that  and a whole lot of others    yes  but they used soft radiation  it was hard  they were packing all they had into the ocean  all their power   that could have unpleasant consequences   i pointed out    violation of the convention of the four and the un    kelvin    dont pretend  it doesnt matter now  gibarian is dead    oh  sartorius wants to blame everything on him    i do not know  i didnt talk to him about it  its not important  sartorius believes that since the  visitor  always appears only when you wake up  he must be extracting the production recipe from us while we sleep  he believes that our most important state is sleep  our waking mind   thoughts from the vigil   do you understand    how  by mail    you will frame the jokes separately  this bunch of rays will be modulated by brain currents of one of us  suddenly my head cleared    oh   i said   that someone is me    what    yes  he was thinking of you    thanks so much    what do you say    then how      he said  i shrugged   i consider these x ray sermons about the greatness of man to be buffoonery  and neither do you  maybe not    yes    yes    thats very good   he said and smiled  as if i granted his wish   so youre against this sa story rtorius  i didnt quite understand how it had happened yet  but i could tell by the look in his eyes that he had taken me where he wanted me to go  i was silent  what could i say now   perfect   he said  because theres another project  to rebuild roches apparatus    annihilator       yes  sartorius has already done some preliminary calculations  its real  and it wont even require a lot of power  the apparatus will be active around the clock or for an unlimited time  producing antipoles    hi    wait  how do you imagine it     very simple  this will be the neutrino antipole  ordinary matter remains unchanged  only    neutrino systems are annihilated  understand  he smiled with satisfaction  i sat with my mouth half open  he slowly stopped smiling  he looked at me searchingly  frowning  and waited   the first thought project  then  we reject  what  the second  sartorius is already in it  well call it freedom  i closed my eyes for a moment  suddenly i made up my mind  snaut was not a physicist  sartorius disabled or destroyed the visiphone  very good   id rather call it the slaughterhouse     i said slowly   you were a butcher yourself  maybe not  and now its going to be something completely different  no visitors  no f creatures   nothing  already at the moment of appearance of materialization   there will be a disintegration   its a misunderstanding   i replied  shaking my head with a smile i hoped was natural enough  its not moral scruples  its self preservation  i dont want to die  snaut    what     he was surprised  he looked at me suspiciously  i pulled a crumpled piece of paper from my pocket    i thought about that too  does it surprise you  i was the first to put forward the neutrino hypothesis  wasnt i  look  antipoles can be raised  it is harmless to ordinary matter  thats true  but at the moment of destabilization  when the neutrino system breaks down  its bond energy is released as a surplus  assuming ten to eight ergs for one kilogram of rest mass  we get five to seven times ten to eight for one f form  you know what it means  equivalent to a small uranium charge that explodes inside the station    what are you talking about  but    but sartorius must have considered that     not necessarily   i denied with a malicious smile    see  the point is that sartorius is from the school of frazer and cajolli  according to them  the entire energy of the bonds at the moment of disintegration is released in the form of light radiation  it would just be a strong flash  not entirely safe  but not destructive  but there are other hypotheses  other neutrino field theories  according to cayatt  according to avalov  according to siona  the emission spectrum is much wider  and the maximum falls on hard gamma radiation  its nice that sartorius believes his masters and their theories  but there are others  snaut  and you know what ill tell you  i continued  seeing that my words impressed him    the ocean must also be considered  if he did what he did  he must have used the optimal method  in other words  his action seems to me to be an argument in favor of the latter school   against sartorius    give me that card  kelvin    i handed it to him  he tilted his head  trying to read my scribbles    what is this  he pointed  i took the card from him    this  field transmutation tensor    give it to me      what do you need  i asked  i knew what he would say    i have to show sartorius   as you wish   i replied indifferently    i can give you this  you see  no one has tested it experimentally  we havent seen such systems yet  he believes in frazer  and i calculated with siona  hell tell you im not a physicist and neither is siona  at least in his understanding  but thats up for discussion  i dont want a discussion that will evaporate to the greater glory of sartorius  i can convince you  not him  and i wont try    so what do you want to do     hes working on it   snaut said flatly  he hunched over  all his animation gone  i didnt know if he trusted me  but i didnt care   what a man theyre trying to kill does   i replied quietly    ill try to contact him  maybe hes thinking about some security   snaut muttered  he looked up at me   look  what if      this first project  what  sartorius will agree  definitely  its    anyway    a chance      do you believe that   no   he replied immediately    but    whats the harm  i didnt want to agree too quickly  thats what i wanted  he was becoming my ally in the stalling game   ill think about it   i said   ill go then   he muttered  standing up  all his bones creaked as he rose from his chair    so can you get yourself an encephalogram  he asked  rubbing the surface of his apron with his fingers as if trying to wipe an invisible stain off it   okay   i said  paying no attention to harey  she was watching the scene silently with a book in her lap   he walked to the door  when it closed behind him  i stood up  i unfolded the piece of paper in my hand  the formulas were accurate  i didnt fake them  i just dont know if siona would admit to my development  probably not  i twitched  harey came up behind me and touched my shoulder    kris    what honey    who it was    i told you  dr  snaut    what kind of man is this    i dont know much about him  why are you asking    thats how he looked at me      he must have liked you   no   she shook her head  it wasnt that kind of look  he was looking at me like    like    she shuddered  looked up at me  then looked down at me  lets go somewhere from here
