at 7pm ship time  i walked past those standing around the well  down the metal rungs and into the bunker  there was just enough room to put your elbows up  after screwing the end into the cable protruding from the wall  the suit inflated and from then on i could not make the slightest movement  i stood   or rather hung   in the air bed  fused into one with the metal shell  looking up  i saw through the curved glass of the wells walls  and saw moddards face above it  it disappeared immediately and darkness fell as a heavy protective cone was placed overhead  i heard the repeated whistling of electric motors tightening the screws eight times  then   the hiss of air being admitted to the shock absorbers  his eyes were getting used to the darkness  ive already seen the celadon outline of the only gauge    ready  kelvin  echoed through the headphones   ready  moddard   i replied    dont worry about anything  the station will pick you up  he said    happy journey  before i could answer  something creaked overhead  and the pod shuddered  i tensed my muscles instinctively  but nothing else happened    when does it start  i asked and heard a murmur  as if grains of the finest sand were falling on the membrane    youre on your way  kelvin  keep well  answered moddards close voice  before i could believe it  a wide gap opened in front of my face  through which i saw stars  i tried in vain to find the alpha aquarius towards which prometheus flew away  the sky in these parts of the galaxy told me nothing  i didnt know a single constellation  there was sparkling dust in the narrow window  i was waiting for the first star to fill up  i didnt notice it  they only began to weaken and disappear  dissolving in the ruddy background  i realized that i was already in the upper layers of the atmosphere  stiff  wrapped in pneumatic cushions  i could only look straight ahead  there was still no horizon  i flew and flew  not feeling it at all  only slowly  insidiously  my body was covered with heat  outside  there was a soft  shrill sound like metal on wet glass  were it not for the numbers popping out of the indicator hole  i would not have realized the suddenness of my fall  the stars were gone  the peephole was filled with reddish brightness  i could hear my own heavy pulse  my face was burning  i could feel the cold breeze of the air conditioner on the back of my neck  i wished i had seen prometheus   he must have been out of sight by now   when the automatic device opened the sight  the pod shuddered once and twice  vibrated unbearably  the shudder passed through all the insulating layers  through the airbags and penetrated deep into my body   the aquamarine outline of the indicator blurred  i watched it without fear  i didnt come that far to die on target   solaris station   i said    solaris station  solaris station  do something  i seem to be losing stability  solaris station  here you come  reception  and again i missed an important moment of the planets appearance  it spread out huge  flat  from the size of the streaks on its surface  i could tell that i was still far away  or rather   high  because i have already passed the elusive border at which the distance from the celestial body becomes height  i was falling  i was still falling  i could feel it now  even with my eyes closed  i opened them immediately because i wanted to see as much as possible  i waited a few dozen seconds of silence and repeated the calls  and this time i got no answer  the crackles of lightning flashed through the headphones in salvos  their background was a hum so deep and low as if it were the voice of the planet itself  the orange sky in the peephole turned white  his glass darkened  i instinctively shrunk as much as the pneumatic bandages would allow before  in the next second  i realized they were clouds  as if blown away  a shoal of them flew up  i glided on  sometimes in the sun  sometimes in the shadow  the container rotated along its vertical axis and a huge  swollen  sun disc flowed steadily in front of my face  appearing on the left and setting on the right  suddenly  through the noise and crackling  a distant voice began to speak directly into the ear    solaris station to the newcomer  solaris station to the newcomer  everythings all right  you come under the control of the station  solaris station to newcomer  prepare for zero time landing  i repeat  prepare for zero time landing  attention  im starting  two hundred and fifty  two hundred and forty nine  two hundred and forty eight     the individual words were separated by fractional meows  showing that he was not speaking a human  it was strange to say the least  normally  the living rushes to the airport when someone new arrives  and straight from earth at that  but i could think no more of it  for the great circle which the sun had made around me reared up with the plain toward which i was flying  this tilt was followed by another  in the opposite direction  i swung like the weight of a giant pendulum  and fighting my vertigo  i saw in the rising sky of the planet  striped with dirty lilac and blackish streaks  a tiny checkerboard of white and green dots   the landmark of the station  at the same time something snapped off the top of the canister   the long necklace of an annular parachute  which whirred violently  there was something indescribably earthly about the sound   the first sound of real wind after so many months  everything started happening very quickly  all i knew was that i was falling  now i saw it  the green and white chessboard grew rapidly  i could see that it was painted on the elongated  whale like  silvery body  with radar sensor needles sticking out at the sides  with rows of darker window openings  that this metal colossus did not rest on the surface of the planet  but hung above it   dragging his shadow across the inky black background  an elliptical patch of darkness still deeper  at the same time i saw the violet furrows of the ocean revealing a faint movement  then the clouds moved high  edged in dazzling crimson  the sky between them became distant and flat  dark orange  and everything blurred  i went into a corkscrew  before i could speak  a brief blow brought the container back to its upright position  and through the sight glass  the ocean shone with mercurial light  undulating to the smoky horizon  the snarling lines and rings of the parachute suddenly detached and flew over the waves  carried by the wind  and the canister swung softly  in that special  slow motion it usually has in an artificial force field  and slid down  the last thing i saw were lattice aircraft catapults and two mirrors of lattice radio telescopes  probably several stories high  something immobilized the container with the shrill sound of steel striking steel against steel  something opened beneath me  and with a long  puffing sigh  the metal shell in which i was sitting upright ended its one hundred and eighty kilometre journey    solaris station  zero and zero  landing done  its over   i heard the dead voice of the control device  with both hands  i felt a vague pressure on my chest  and my insides felt like an unpleasant heaviness  i gripped the hilts in front of my shoulders and disconnected the contacts  the green word earth flashed and the wall of the container swung open  the pneumatic bed pushed me slightly in the back  so that i had to take a step forward to keep from falling  with a soft hiss  like a resigned sigh  the air left the coils of the suit  i was free  i was standing under a nave high  silver funnel  bunches of colored pipes ran down the walls  disappearing into round manholes  i turned around  ventilation shafts roared  sucking in the remnants of the planets poisonous atmosphere that had intruded upon landing  the containers cigar  empty as a bursting cocoon  stood on a bowl sunk into a steel hill  its outer sheets had charred a dirty brown  i went down a small ramp  then a layer of rough plastic was welded onto the metal  it had worn down to bare steel where rocket lift carts usually rolled  suddenly  the fan compressors fell silent  and there was complete silence  i looked around a bit helplessly  expecting a human to appear  but still no one was coming  only the neon arrow showed  blazing  the silent conveyor belt  i entered his plane  the ceiling of the hall flowed down in a beautiful parabolic line  turning into a corridor pipe  heaps of compressed gas cylinders  canisters  annular parachutes  crates  piled up in its alcoves  all piled up in a messy mess  this also made me wonder  the conveyor ended at the circular extension of the corridor  there was even more disorder here  a puddle of oily liquid spread beneath the heap of tin bubbles  an unpleasant  strong odor filled the air  there were footprints in different directions  clearly imprinted in the sticky liquid  rolls of white telegraph tapes  torn papers and rubbish lay among the tins  as if swept out of the cabins  again the green indicator flashed  directing me to the middle door  behind them ran a corridor so narrow that two men could barely pass in it  the lighting was provided by the upper windows  pointed at the sky  with lenticular glasses  another door  painted green and white checkerboard  they were repealed  i went inside  the semi spherical cabin had one large panorama window  the mist covered sky was burning in it  below  the blackish mounds of waves moved noiselessly  the walls were full of open cupboards  they were filled with instruments  books  glasses with dried sediment  dusty thermoses  there were five or six mechanical  rolling tables on the dirty floor  with several armchairs between them  sagging because they had been deflated  only one was bloated  with its back tilted back  there sat a small  skinny man with a sunburnt face  the skin peeled off his nose and cheekbones in patches  i knew him  it was snaut  gibarians second in command  the cyberneticist  in his time  he published some not so original articles in the solaristic almanac  ive never seen him before  he was wearing a net shirt through which a single gray hair of a flat chest poked out through the eyelets  and once white linen trousers stained at the knees and with many pockets like a fitters  in his hand was a plastic pear  the kind you drink out of on ships without artificial gravity  he looked at me as if struck by a blinding light  a pear dropped from his relaxed fingers and bounced up and down like a balloon  some clear liquid spilled out of it  slowly all the blood drained from his face  i was too surprised to speak  and the silent scene continued until his fear communicated to me in some incomprehensible way  i took a step  he shrunk in the chair   snaut     i whispered  he trembled as if struck  looking at me with indescribable disgust  he croaked    i dont know you  i dont know you  what do you want     the spilled liquid evaporated quickly  i smelled alcohol  drank  he was drunk  but why was he so afraid  i was still in the middle of the cabin  my knees were soft and my ears were stuffed with cotton wool  i took the pressure of the floor under my feet as something not yet completely certain  the ocean moved steadily through the curved glass of the window  snaut kept his bloodshot eyes on me  the fear left his face  but the unspeakable disgust remained    whats wrong     i asked in a low voice    are you sick   you care     he said dully    i see  youll care  wont you  but why about me  i do not know you    where is gibarian  i asked  he lost his breath for a second  his eyes glassy again  something flickered and went out    gi    giba      he stammered   no  no    he trembled with a soundless  idiotic chuckle  which suddenly stopped    you came to gibarian     he said almost calmly    to gibarian  what do you want to do with it  he looked at me as if i had suddenly ceased to be dangerous to him  there was something hatefully offensive in his words  and even more so in their tone   what are you talking about   i stammered  stunned    where is he  he was stunned    you do not know     hes drunk  i thought  drunk to unconsciousness  i was filled with growing anger  actually  i should have left  but my patience ran out    come to your senses  i boomed   how do i know where he is if i just arrived   whats wrong with you  snaut    his jaw dropped  he lost his breath again for a moment  but somehow  a sudden gleam appeared in his eyes  with trembling hands  he gripped the armrests of the chair and struggled to his feet  his joints creaking    what  he said almost sober    did you come  where did you come from   from earth   i replied furiously    have you heard of her  looks like not    from zie    heavens    are you   kelvin     yes  what are you looking at  whats weird about that   nothing   he said  blinking rapidly    nothing  he rubbed his forehead    kelvin  im sorry  its nothing  you know  just a surprise  i did not expect    how did you not expect it  after all  you got the message months ago  and mod dard telegraphed today from the pro metheus      yes  yes    probably  just see  there is a certain    chaos here   yes   i replied dryly    its hard not to see it  snaut walked around me as if checking the appearance of my suit  the most ordinary in the world  with a harness of wires and cables across the chest  he coughed several times  he touched his bony nose    would you like to take a bath     it will help you choose   the blue door on the opposite side    thank you  i know the layout of the station    maybe youre hungry       no  wheres gibarian  he walked over to the window as if he hadnt heard my question  turned back with the kilns  he looked much older  his close cropped hair was gray  and the nape of his neck  sunburnt  was lined with cuts as deep as cuts  outside the window  great crests of waves glistened  rising and falling as slowly as if the ocean was solidifying  looking there  the station seemed to move slightly sideways  as if sliding off an invisible base  then she returned to balance and with the same lazy tilt she walked in the other direction  but that was probably an illusion  patches of blood colored slime foam gathered in the hollows between the waves  for an instant  i felt a sickening pressure in my pit  the dry order of the prometheus decks seemed to me something precious  irretrievably lost   listen     snaut said suddenly   only me for the moment     he turned around  he rubbed his hands nervously   youll have to be content with my company   see you  call me rat  you only know me from photos  but thats okay  thats what everyone says  im afraid theres no way around that  after all  when you have parents with such cosmic aspirations as me  only the rat starts to sound something like that       where is gibarian  i asked stubbornly again  he blinked    im sorry to receive you like this  its    not just my fault  i completely forgot  there was a lot going on here  you know     ah  all right   i said    lets leave it  so what about gibarian  hes not at the station  flew somewhere   no   he replied  he stared at the corner lined with spools of cable    he didnt fly anywhere  and it wont  because of this    among other things      what  i asked  my ears were still clogged and i thought i couldnt hear better    whats that supposed to mean  where is he   you already know   he said in a completely different tone  he stared into my eyes coldly  making me shiver  he may have been drunk  but he knew what he was talking about    it didnt       has become    accident  he nodded  he not only nodded  but also approved of my reaction    when    this morning at dawn  strange thing  i didnt feel a jolt  the whole brief exchange of monosyllabic questions and answers rather reassured me with its matter of factness  i thought i understood his previously incomprehensible behavior    how   get changed  put your things in order  and come back here in    in  say  an hour   i hesitated a moment    okay   wait   he said as i turned to the door  he was looking at me in a special way  i could see that what he wanted to say didnt come out of his mouth    there were three of us and now  with you  there are three again  do you know sartorius    like you  from the photo   hes in the lab upstairs  and i dont think hell be out until nightfall  but   youll recognize him anyway   if you saw someone else  you know  not me or sartorius  you understand  then      so what  i didnt know if i was dreaming  against the backdrop of black waves glistening bloody in the low sun  he sat in his chair with his head lowered as before and stared sideways at the spools of coiled cable    its    dont do anything    who can i see  ghost   i burst out    i see  you think im crazy  no  im not crazy  i cant tell you otherwise    for now  anyway  maybe    nothing will happen  anyway  remember  i warned you    from what   what are you talking about   take control of yourself   he said stubbornly    act like    be prepared for anything  its impossible  i know  try it anyway  thats the only advice  i dont know another    but what will i see    i almost shouted  i barely refrained from grabbing him by the shoulders and giving him a good shake as he sat staring into the corner  his sunburned face tired and struggling to force out single words    i do not know  in a way  its up to you    hallucinations    no  it is   real  no    attack  remember    what are you talking about   i replied in a non my voice    were not on earth    polytheria  but they are not human at all  i called  i didnt know what to do to shake him out of this obsession from which he seemed to read the blood curdling nonsense   thats why its so scary   he said quietly    remember  be careful    what happened to gibarian  he did not answer    what does sartorius do    come back in an hour  i turned and left  as i opened the door  i looked at him again  he sat with his face in his hands  small  shrunken  in stained trousers  i noticed only now that there was caked blood on the knuckles of both hands
