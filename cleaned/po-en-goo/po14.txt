i was sitting by the big window and looking at the ocean  i had nothing to do  the report  compiled in five days  was now a bundle of waves hurtling through the void somewhere beyond the constellation of orion  when it reaches the dark dust nebula that spreads over eight trillion cubic miles and absorbs every signal and ray of light  it hits the first in a chain of relays  from here  from one radio buoy to the next  in leaps of billions of miles  it would race along the curvature of the great arc until the last relay  a metal lump full of tightly packed precision instruments  with an elongated directional antenna snout  focused it once more and hurled it farther into space  towards the earth  then months would pass  and the same burst of energy  trailing a furrow of shock distortions in the galactic gravitational field  launched from earth  would strike the cosmic cloud head  slither  amplified along a necklace of slowly drifting buoys  and with undiminished speed rush towards the double suns of solaris  the ocean beneath the high red sun was blacker than ever  a red mist melted his contact with the sky  the day was exceptionally steamy  as if it heralded one of those extremely rare and beyond imagination violent storms that hit the planet several times a year  there is reason to believe that its sole inhabitant controls the climate and causes these storms himself  for a few more months i was to look out from these windows  to watch from above the liberties of white gold and weary red  reflected from time to time in some liquid eruption  in a silvery bubble of symmetry  to follow the slender slender leaning against the wind  to meet half weathered  flaking the mimosas  one day  all the visiphone screens will start to flutter with light  all electronic signaling  long dead  will come to life  triggered by an impulse sent from a distance of hundreds of thousands of kilometers  heralding the approach of a metal colossus that will descend over the ocean with a long thunder of gravitors  itll be ulysses or prometheus or some of the great long range cruisers  when i climb the gangplank from the flat roof of the station  i will see on the decks rows of white armored  massive automatons that do not share the original sin with man and are so innocent that they carry out every command until they completely destroy themselves or the obstacle that stands in their way  if their crystal oscillating memory was so programmed  and then the ship would move  noiseless  faster than sound  leaving behind a cone of thunder split into bass octaves across the ocean  and everyones face would light up for a moment with the thought that they were going home  but i didnt have a home  earth  i thought of her great  crowded  roaring cities  where i would be lost  almost lost  as if i had done what i wanted to do on the second or third night  throw myself into the ocean  heavily heaving in the darkness  i will drown in people  i will be silent and attentive  and therefore a valued companion  i will have many acquaintances  even friends  and women  and perhaps even one woman  for a while i will have to compel myself to smile  to bow  to get up  to do the thousand little things that make up earthly life  until i can no longer feel them  i will find new interests  new activities  but i will not give myself completely to them  to nothing or anyone  never again  and perhaps i will look at night where the darkness of the dust cloud in the sky  like a black veil  holds back the glare of two suns  remembering everything  even what i think now  and i will remember with an indulgent smile  in which there will be a bit of regret  but also superiority  my follies and hopes  i dont think that future self is any worse than kelvin  who was willing to do anything for a cause called contact  and no one will have the right to judge me  snaut entered the cabin  he looked around  then looked at me  and i got up and walked over to the table    did you want something    you dont seem to have anything to do     he asked  blinking    i could give you  you know  there are some calculations  admittedly not the most urgent       thank you   i smiled   but its unnecessary    are you sure  he asked  looking out the window    yes  ive been thinking about things and      i wish you wouldnt think so much    ah  then you dont know what it is  tell me  do you    believe in god  he looked at me sharply    what are you  who still believes today    anxiety smoldered in his eyes   its not that simple   i said deliberately lightly   because im not talking about the traditional god of earthly beliefs  im not a religiologist and maybe i didnt invent anything  but do you happen to know if there was ever a belief in a god    defective    crippled  he repeated  raising his eyebrows    how do you understand it  in a sense  the god of every religion was defective  because he was burdened with human features  only magnified  the god of the old testament  for example  was a violent and sacrificial man who was jealous of other gods    the greek gods  by their quarrelsomeness  family feuds  were no less humanly flawed      no   i interrupted him   i am talking about a god whose imperfection results from not from the ingenuity of its human creators  but is its most essential  immanent feature  it is supposed to be god  limited in his omniscience and omnipotence  fallible in predicting the future of his works  and whose course of phenomena shaped by him can terrify  it is a god    a crippled god who always wants more than he can  and does not immediately realize it  who invented clocks  but not the time they measure  policies or mechanisms that serve specific purposes  but they have outgrown these goals and betrayed them  and he created infinity  which from the measure of his power  which it was supposed to be  became the measure of his boundless defeat   once  manichaeism     snaut began hesitantly  the suspicious reserve with which he had spoken to me of late disappeared   but it has nothing to do with the principle of good and evil   i interrupted him immediately    this god does not exist outside matter and cannot free himself from it  he only wants it      i dont know such a religion   he said after a moment of silence   it was never   needed   if i understand you correctly  and im afraid i do  are you thinking of some kind of evolving god who evolves over time and grows up  rising to higher and higher levels of power  to the awareness of its powerlessness  this god of yours is a being who entered divinity as if in a dead end situation  and having understood this  gave himself up to despair  yes  but a grieving god is a man  my dear  you mean man    its not just bad philosophy  its even bad mysticism  no  i replied stubbornly  i dont mean a man  it may be that in some features it would fit this provisional definition  but thats only because its full of gaps  contrary to appearances  man does not create goals for himself  they are imposed on him by the time in which he was born  he can serve them or rebel against them  but the object of service or rebellion is given from outside  in order to experience the complete freedom of searching for goals  he would have to be alone  and this cannot succeed  because a man who has not been brought up among people cannot become a man  this    mine must be a non plural being  you know   ah   he said   that i immediately     he pointed out the window   no   i objected   and he doesnt   at most  as something that missed the chance of divinity in its development  having closed itself too early  hes more of an anchorite  a hermit of the cosmos  not a god of it    he repeats himself  snaut  and the one im thinking of would never do that  perhaps it is being created somewhere  in some corner of the galaxy  and soon it will begin to extinguish some stars and ignite others in a fit of youthful intoxication  we will notice it after a while      we already noticed   said snaut sourly    novae and supernovae    do you think these are the candles of his altar   if you want to take what i say so literally      perhaps solaris is the cradle of your divine infant   added snaut  his ever expanding smile framed his eyes with fine lines   perhaps he is the first fruit in your understanding  the seed of the god of despair  perhaps his vital childhood is still far beyond his rationality  and all that our solaristic libraries contain is only a great catalog of his infant reflexes     time we were his toys   i finished    yes  its possible  and do you know what you did  create a whole new hypothesis about solaris  and thats really not just anything  and you immediately have an explanation for the impossibility of making contact  the lack of response  some   lets call it that   extravagance in dealing with us  the psyche of a small child      i give up authorship   he muttered  standing by the window  we stared at the black undulation for a long time  there was a pale oblong speck in the fog on the eastern horizon    where did this concept of a defective god come from  he asked suddenly  not taking his eyes off the glowing desert    i do not know  it felt very  very real to me  you know  he is the only god in whom i would be inclined to believe  whose passion is not redemption  saves nothing  serves nothing  only exists   mimiid     snaut said quite quietly  in a different voice    what are you saying  oh yes  ive noticed him before  very old  we both looked at the hazy red horizon     ill fly   i said unexpectedly    especially since ive never left the station  and this is a good opportunity  ill be back in half an hour      what are you saying  snape opened his eyes    will you recommend  where   there   i pointed to a fleshy blur looming in the mist    whats the harm  ill take a small helicopter  itd be funny  you know  if   on earth   i had to admit one day that im a solarist whos never even set foot on solarian soil    i went to the wardrobe and started to sort through the overalls  snaut watched me silently until he said   i dont like this     what  i turned around with the suit in my hands  a long unknown excitement seized me    what do you mean  cards on the table  youre afraid that something    nonsense  i give you my word no  i didnt even think about it  no  really not    ill fly with you    thank you  but i prefer alone  but this is something new  something completely new   i said quickly as i pulled on my jumpsuit  snaut was saying something else  but i wasnt really listening  searching for the things i needed  he followed me to the airport  he helped me roll the machine out of the box and into the center of the starting plate  as i put on the suit  he suddenly asked   does the word still have any value to you     good god  snaut  you still  ma  and i already gave them to you  where are the spare cylinders  he didnt say anything else  when i closed the transparent dome  i gave him a sign with my hand  he activated the lift  and i rode slowly to the top of the station  the motor woke up with a long whirr  the tri propeller spun  and the apparatus rose oddly slightly  leaving the stations ever smaller  silvery disk below  i was alone at the ocean for the first time  an impression completely different from that experienced at the windows  perhaps it was also the low flight  i glided only a few dozen meters above the waves  only now did i not only know but feel that the alternating greasy gleaming humps and fissures of the abyss moved not like a sea tide or a cloud  but like an animal  constant  if extremely slow  contractions of the muscled naked torso   thats what it looked like  the sleepily turning crest of each wave burned foam red  as i swerved to steer exactly in the course of the island of mimoid drifting with extraordinary slowness  the sun struck me squarely in the eye  quivered in lightning bolts of blood in the convex windows  and the ocean itself became inky blue with spots of dark fire  a circle i had not skillfully made carried me far to leeward  and the mimoid was left behind as a wide  bright patch  cut off irregularly from the ocean  it lost its pink tint given to it by the mist  it was yellowish like dried bone  and for a moment it disappeared from my sight  and instead i saw the station in the distance  seemingly hovering right over the ocean like a huge  old fashioned zeppelin  i repeated the maneuver  straining my full attention  the mimoid massif  with its steep  grotesque relief  was rising on course  i thought i could hook on the highest of its bulbous protrusions  and i pulled the chopper up so violently that  losing speed  it wobbled all over  caution was unnecessary  for the rounded tops of the bizarre towers floated low below  i leveled the plane with the drifting island and slowly  meter by meter  began to lose altitude until crumbling peaks rose above the cabin  he wasnt great  it was perhaps three quarters of a mile from end to end  and barely a few hundred yards wide  in some places it showed a narrowing  announcing that it would soon break there  it must have been part of a formation incomparably larger  on the solarian scale it was a tiny splinter  a debris  counting god knows how many weeks and months  i discovered   between the veiny heights broken over the ocean itself   a kind of shore  several dozen square meters of quite sloping  but almost flat surface  and i directed the machine there  the landing turned out to be more difficult than i thought  i almost bumped the propeller against the wall growing in front of my eyes  but i managed  i turned off the engine immediately and threw the dome back  i also checked  standing on the wing  whether the helicopter was in danger of sliding into the ocean  the waves licked the jagged edge a dozen paces from my landing  but it stood firm on its wide spaced skids  i jumped down to     ground   what i had taken for a wall  which i had almost tripped over  was a huge  riddled with holes  membranous thin bone plate  set upside down  overgrown with gallery like swellings  a gap several meters wide  it diagonally divided the entire multi story plane  revealing   like its large  irregularly spaced openings   a perspective of depth  some four stories above the ocean  looking down into a skeletal landscape  only now could i get a full view of it  the resemblance to an archaic half ruined city  some exotic moroccan settlement centuries ago  knocked down by an earthquake or some other cataclysm  was astonishing  winding  partly buried and obstructed ravines of streets  their intricate  roman slopes towards the shore  washed with greasy foam  above the surviving battlements  bastions  their round settlements  and in the convex and concave walls black openings  similar to broken windows or fortress entrances  all this island city  leaning heavily to one side like a half sunken ship  moved ahead in a senseless  unconscious movement  turning very slowly  as evidenced by the apparent movement of the sun in the firmament  causing shadows to creep lazily between the recesses of the ruins  sometimes a ray of sunlight slipped through them and reached where i stood  i climbed even higher  risking quite a bit  until fine rubble began to fall from the upturned growths over my head  as it fell  it filled the winding ravines and alleys with great clouds of dust  the mimoid is not naturally a rock  and its resemblance to limestone vanishes when the chip is held in the hand  it is far lighter than pumice  small celled  therefore extremely airy  i was high enough now that i felt its movement  not only was it moving forward  pushed by the black muscles of the ocean  out of nowhere  out of nowhere  but it was tilting  now one way and then the other  extremely slowly  each of these swinging swings were accompanied by a long  sticky sound of brown and yellow froths dripping from the emerging edge  this rocking motion had been imparted to him a very long time ago  probably at birth  he had retained it because of his enormous mass  having seen as far as i could from my aerial position  i carefully climbed down  and then  oddly enough  i realized that the mimoid didnt interest me at all  that i had come here to meet not him but the ocean  i sat down on the rough  cracked surface  the helicopter a dozen paces behind me  the black wave crept heavily onto the shore  flattening and losing color at the same time  as she drew back  quivering threads of mucus ran down the edge of the land  i slid even lower and extended my hand to the next one  then she faithfully repeated that phenomenon  experienced by people for the first time almost a century ago  she hesitated  withdrew  poured over my hand without touching it  so that between the surface of the glove and the inside of the cavity  which instantly changed consistency  becoming from liquid to almost fleshy a thin layer of air remains  then i raised my hand slowly  the wave  or rather its narrow branch  followed it upwards  still encircling my hand with an increasingly bright  translucent  dirty greenish cyst  i got up  otherwise i couldnt raise my arm higher  the thread of gelatinous substance stretched like a wobbly string  but did not break  the base of the completely flattened wave  like a strange creature waiting patiently for the end of these experiences  clung to the shore around my feet  also without touching them   it was as if a malleable flower had grown out of the ocean  its calyx enveloping my fingers  becoming a precise but untouching negative  i stepped back  the stalk trembled and reluctantly came back down  flexible  wavering  unsteady  the wave surged  drawing it in  and disappeared over the edge of the shore  i repeated this game until  like a hundred years ago  one wave in turn indifferently ebbed away  as if fed with a new sensation  and i knew that i would have to wait several hours for its  curiosity  to awaken  i sat down as before  but as if changed by this theory so well a known phenomenon that i had caused  theory could not  could not  reflect the real experience  in the budding  growing  spreading of this creature  in each of its movements separately and all at once  there was a kind of   one would like to say   cautious but not timid naivete  when he tried furiously and quickly to know  to embrace a new shape he had met unexpectedly  and half way had to retreat when he threatened to overstep the boundaries established by mysterious law  yes of his immense presence  of his strong  absolute silence  of falam breathing steadily and  staring  stunned  i descended into seemingly inaccessible regions of inertia and in the growing intensity of loss i united myself with this fluid  blind colossus  as if i forgave him everything without the slightest effort  without words  without a single thought  id been so sensible all week that snauts mistrustful gleam finally stopped haunting me  outwardly  i was calm  secretly  without realizing it clearly  i was expecting something  what  her return  how could i  each of us knows that we are material beings  subject to the laws of physiology and physics  and that the strength of all our emotions taken together cannot fight these laws  it can only hate them  the eternal faith of lovers and poets in the power of love  which is more lasting than death  this finis vitae sed non amoris that has been chasing us for centuries  is a lie  but this lie is only futile  not funny  instead  to be a clock measuring the passage of time  alternately shattered and reassembled  in whose mechanism  when the constructor pushes the gears  despair and love begin to follow with their first movement  knowing that one is a repeater of torment  the deeper it becomes through the multitude of repetitions more comical  repetition of human existence  all right  but repetition like a drunkard repeating a hackneyed tune  dropping new coppers into the jukebox  i did not believe for a moment that this liquid colossus  which has brought death to many hundreds of people  with which my whole race has been trying in vain for decades to establish even a thread of understanding  that it  floating me unconsciously like a grain of powder  would be moved by the tragedy of two people    but his actions had a purpose  true  i wasnt even sure about that  to leave  however  meant to cross out this  perhaps faint  perhaps only imaginary chance that the future hid  so years among the equipment  things we touched together  in the air still remembering her breath  in the name of what  hope for her return  i had no hope  but the anticipation lived in me  the last thing i had left of her  what fulfillments  mockery  what other torments did i expect  i knew nothing  remaining in the unshakable faith that the time of cruel miracles had not passed
