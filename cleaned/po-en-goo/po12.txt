six days later  the lack of any reaction prompted us to repeat the experiment  the station  which had been stationary at the intersection of the forty third parallel and the one hundred and sixteenth meridian  sailing  maintaining a height of four hundred meters above the ocean  in a southerly direction  where  as indicated by the satellites radar sensors and radiographs  plasma activity has increased significantly  for two days  the x ray beam  modulated by my encephalogram  hit invisibly  at intervals of several hours  the almost completely smooth surface of the ocean  at the end of the second day we were so close to the pole that when almost the whole disk of the blue sun was hiding behind the horizon  the purple swelling of the clouds on the opposite side heralded the rise of the red sun  the black immensity of the ocean and the empty sky above it were then filled with a dazzling riot of colors  hard  metallically incandescent  gleaming poisonous green  with muffled dull flames of purple  and the ocean itself was pierced by the reflections of two opposing shields  two violent fires  mercury and crimson  then it took the smallest cloud at the zenith for the lights flowing with heavy foam along the slants of the waves to be enriched with incredible rainbow shimmers  just after sunset of the blue sun on the north western horizon appeared  at first heralded by signaling devices  melted almost indistinguishably with the red brown mist and emerging from it only with single  specular gleams like a gigantic flower of glass growing there  at the junction of sky and gley   symmetry  the station  however  did not change course  and after a quarter of an hour  the colossus  quivering red like a dimming ruby lamp  disappeared again over the horizon  a few minutes later  a tall  thin pillar  the base of which was already hidden from our eyes by the curvature of the planet  soared several kilometers  silently rising into the atmosphere  this obvious sign of the end of the perceived symmetriad  half burning bloody  the other glowing like a pillar of mercury  grew into a two toned tree  then the ends of its ever swelling branches merged into one fungus cloud  the upper part of which set off in the fire of two suns for a long journey with the wind  and the lower one  heavy  strewn with clustered debris on the third part of the horizon  was falling extremely slowly  after an hour  the last trace of this spectacle disappeared  and again two days passed  the experiment was repeated for the last time  the x ray punctures already covered a considerable stretch of gley ocean  to the south appeared perfectly visible from our rise  despite the distance of three hundred kilometers  arrhenida  sixth  a rocky chain of snow frozen peaks  in fact deposits of organic origin  indicating that the formation was once the bottom of the ocean  we then changed course to the south east and glided for some time parallel to the mountain barrier  mixed with clouds typical of a red day  until they too disappeared  ten days have passed since the first experiment  all this time nothing really happened on the station  once sartorius developed the programming of the experiment  it was repeated by automatic apparatus  and im not even sure that anyone controlled its operation  but at the same time  there was much more going on at the station than one could wish for  not between people  i was afraid sartorius would demand that work on the annihilator be resumed  and i waited for snauts reaction when he learned from the other that i had somehow deceived him by exaggerating the danger of annihilating neutrino matter  but nothing of the sort happened for reasons that were at first quite puzzling to me  of course  i also considered some ruse  some concealment on their part of preparations and work  so every day i peeked into the windowless room just below the floor of the main laboratory where the annihilator was located  i never found anyone there  and the film of dust covering the armor and cables of the apparatus showed that it had not been touched for many weeks  snaut at that time became as invisible as sartorius  and even more elusive than him  because the visiphone in the radio station did not answer the call  someone had to be in charge of the stations movements  but i cant say who because i just didnt care  as strange as that may sound  the lack of reaction from the ocean also left me indifferent to such an extent that after two or three days i almost stopped counting on it or fearing it  completely forgot about it and the experience  all day i sat either in the library or in a cubicle with harey shadowing me  i saw that we were not well and that this state of apathetic and thoughtless suspension could not last indefinitely  i should have broken it somehow  changed something in our relationship  but the thought of any change i put off  unable to make any decision  i cant explain it any other way  but it seemed to me that everything on the station  and especially what is between harey and me  was in a state of extremely unstable  breakneckly piled up equilibrium  and its violation could turn everything into ruin  why  i do not know  the strangest thing was that she too felt  at least to some extent  something similar  when i think about it now  it seems to me that this feeling of uncertainty  suspension  the moment before the impending earthquake was caused by a presence that was imperceptible in any other way  filling all the decks and rooms of the station  though there was perhaps another way to guess her  dreams  as i have never had such apparitions before or since  i have decided to write down their contents  and it is only thanks to this that i can utter something about them  but they are also only scraps  deprived of almost all their terrible richness  in virtually inexpressible circumstances  in spaces devoid of sky  earth  floors  ceilings or walls  i was as if shrunken or imprisoned in a substance externally foreign to me  as if my whole body was rooted in a half dead  motionless  shapeless lump  or rather  as if bodyless  surrounded at first by indistinct patches of pale pink  suspended in a medium of optical properties different from air  so that only very close up did things become clear  even excessively and supernaturally clear  for in these dreams my immediate environment was greater than the concreteness and materiality of the waking experience  waking up  i had the paradoxical feeling that waking  real waking  was just that  and what i see when i open my eyes is only some dried up shadow of it  so that was the first image  the beginning from which the dream emerged  around me something waited for permission  for my consent  for an inner nod  and i knew  or rather something in me knew  that i should not succumb to the incomprehensible temptation  because the more he silently promises  the more terrible the end will be  but i didnt really know  because then i would have been afraid  and i never felt fear  i waited  the first touch emerged from the pink mist around me  and i  limp as a block  were stuck somewhere deep in what seemed to lock me in  unable to withdraw or move  and that explored my prison with touches both blind and seeing  and it was already like a hand that created me  up to that moment i had not even sighted  and behold  i saw   under the fingers roaming in the dark over my face  my lips  cheeks emerged from nothingness  and as this infinitely tiny touch expanded  i already had a face and a breathing torso  called into existence this   symmetrical   act of creation  because i  being created  was creating in turn  and a face i had never seen before appeared  strange  familiar  i tried to look into its eyes  but i couldnt do it  because everything was still changed by proportions because there were no directions here and only in a kind of praying silence we discovered each other and became each other  and i was already a living me  but intensified as if without limits  and that being   a woman  she stood still with me  the pulse filled us and we were one  and then suddenly something unspeakably cruel  impossible  and unnatural crept into the slowness of this scene  beyond which nothing existed and could not possibly exist  the same touch that created us and clung to our bodies with an invisible golden cloak began to tingle  our bodies  naked and white  began to flow  blackening into streams of wriggling vermin that escaped us like air  and i was   we were   i was a glittering  intertwining and unraveling  febrile mass of wormlike motion  endless  endless  and in that immeasurably   no    i  the shore  howled silently  for the extinction  for the end  but just then i scattered in all directions at once and swelled brighter than every waking state  multiplied  focused in black and red distances  now congealing into rock  now culminating somewhere in the glow of another sun or world  suffering  it was the simplest of dreams  the others i cannot tell  because the sources of horror emanating in them no longer had any equivalent in the waking consciousness  i knew nothing of hareys existence in them  but i couldnt find any memories or experiences of the day in them either  there were other dreams in which i felt myself the subject of some painstaking  slow  non sensory research in the deadly darkness  it was a pervading  fragmenting  losing itself to utter emptiness  the top floor  the bottom of these silent  annihilating intersections was fear  the mere mention of which during the day made the heart beat faster  and the days were the same  as if faded  full of dull aversion to everything  crawled sluggishly in extreme indifference  i was only afraid of the night and did not know how to save myself from them  i stayed awake with harey who didnt need sleep at all  kissed and caressed her  but i knew that i didnt care about her or myself  that i did everything for fear of sleep  and she  even though i hadnt told her about those shattering nightmares  not a word she must have guessed something  because i felt in her dying consciousness of constant humiliation  and i couldnt help it  i said that snaut and sartorius had never seen each other  however  snaut made himself known every few days  sometimes with a card  but more often with a telephone call  he asked if i hadnt noticed some new phenomenon  some change  something that could be interpreted as a reaction caused by the experiment repeated so many times  i replied that nothing  and asked the same question myself  snaut only shook his head in the back of the screen in denial  on the fifteenth day after the cessation of the experiments  i awoke earlier than usual  as tired from the nightmare as if i had opened my eyes from the numbness brought on by deep anesthesia  through the open window i saw  in the first glare of the red sun  whose immense extension was slicing a river of crimson fire across the surface of the ocean  imperceptibly blurring this hitherto dead surface  its blackness faded at first  as if covered with a thin layer of mist  but this mist had a very material consistency  centers of unrest arose in it here and there  until an indefinite movement swept all visible space  the blackness disappeared  covered with membranes that blurred it  pale pink at the bulges and pearly brown at the hollows  the alternating colors at first  modeling this strange veil of the ocean into long rows of waves frozen as if by the rolling of the waves  mixed up and the whole ocean was covered with thick bubbles of foam  rising in huge sheets both under and around the station itself  from all sides at once rose into the red  empty sky hymenion winged foam clouds  spread horizontally  completely unlike clouds  with balloon hundred thickened edges  those that covered the low disk of the sun with horizontal streaks were black as coal in contrast to its radiance  others  near the sun  depending on the angle at which the rays of the east hit them  turned red  glowed cherry  magenta  and this process continued  as if the ocean was flaking off in bloody contours  sometimes revealing its black surface from underneath them  sometimes covering itself with a new coating of solidified foams  some of these creatures soared up quite close  just outside the panes  missing them by only meters  and once their silky looking surface brushed against the glass  while those swarms that took off first were barely visible in the depths of the sky  the sky like scattered birds and transparent sediment melted at the zenith  the station was still  stopped  and it lasted about three hours  and the spectacle did not cease  at last  as the sun sank below the horizon and the ocean below us darkened  thousands of swarms of slender silhouettes  blushing  ascended into the sky higher and higher  flowing in endless ranks as if on invisible strings  motionless  weightless and this majestic ascension as if of tattered wings lasted until complete darkness covered them  the whole phenomenon  shocking in its calm immensity  terrified harey  but i could not say anything about it  for me  a solarist  it was as new and incomprehensible as it was for her  but forms and creations not yet listed in any catalogs can be observed on solaris about two or three times a year  and with a bit of luck even more often  the next night  about an hour before the expected blue sunrise  we witnessed another phenomenon   the ocean was phosphorescent  at first  on its invisible surface in the darkness  single patches of light appeared  rather a dawn  whitish  blurred  and they moved in accordance with the rhythm of the waves  they merged and spread until a spectral glow spread to all horizons  the intensity of the glow increased for about fifteen minutes  then the phenomenon came to an astounding end  the ocean began to fade  a zone of darkness  perhaps hundreds of miles wide  was coming from the west  and when it reached and passed the station  the part of the ocean that was still phosphorescent could be seen moving further and further eastward   high in the darkness reaching the glow  reaching the very horizon  it became like a huge aurora borealis  and immediately disappeared  when the sun soon rose  the empty  lifeless plain  barely marked by the ripples of the waves sending mercurial flashes at the windows of the station  spread out again in all directions  ocean phosphorescence was a phenomenon already described  in a certain percentage of cases it was observed before the outburst of asymmetriads  otherwise it was a rather typical sign of locally increased plasma activity  but for the next two weeks  nothing happened outside or inside the station  only once  in the middle of the night  did i hear a distant scream coming as if from nowhere and everywhere at once  extremely high  sharp and prolonged  actually intensified superhumanly  aroused from the nightmare  i lay listening for a long time  not quite sure if that scream was not a dream too  the day before  there had been muffled noises coming from the laboratory partly above our cabin  as if heavy weights or apparatus were being moved  it seemed to me that the scream was also coming from above  in an incomprehensible way  because the two floors were separated by a soundproof ceiling  this agony voice lasted almost half an hour  wet with sweat  half mad  i wanted to run upstairs  he was so nervous  but at last it subsided  and again only the shifting of weights could be heard  two days later  in the evening  when harey and i were sitting in the small kitchen  snaut came in unexpectedly  he was in clothes  real  earthly clothes that changed him  he looked taller and older  without even looking at us  he walked over to the table  leaned over it  and  without sitting down  began to eat the cold meat straight from the can  biting it with bread  as he did so  he stuck the sleeve into the can  staining it with grease   youre smearing yourself   i said    hmm  he just said with his mouth full  he ate as if he hadnt had anything to eat for days  poured himself half a glass of wine  drank it in a gulp  wiped his mouth  and  exhaling  looked around with bloodshot eyes  he looked at me and muttered   youve grown a beard      well  well     harey was throwing the dish into the sink with a noise  snaut began to rock slightly on his heels  grimacing and smacking loudly  cleaning his teeth with his tongue  i thought he was doing it on purpose    you dont want to shave  do you  he asked  staring at me insistently  i didnt answer    be careful  he said after a moment    i advise you to  he also stopped shaving first   go to sleep   i murmured    what  there are no fools  why dont we talk  listen  kelvin  does he wish us well  maybe he wants to make us happy  but he doesnt know how yet  it reads our brains wishes  and only two percent of neural processes are conscious  so he knows us better than we know ourselves  so you have to listen to him  agree  do you think  you do not want  why   his voice broke tearfully   why dont you shave   stop it   i growled    you are drunk    what  drunk  i  what  cant a man whos been carrying his dung from one end of the galaxy to the other to find out how much hes worth get drunk  why  you believe in mans mission  huh  kelvin  gibarian told me about you before he grew a beard    youre exactly as he said    dont just go to the lab  youll lose faith    there sartorius creates our faust au rebours  hes looking for a remedy against immortality  you know  hes the last holy contact knight we can afford    his previous idea was a good one too   prolonged agony  okay  what  agony perpetua    straws    straw hats    how can you not drink  kelvin  his eyes  almost invisible in swollen lids  rested on harey  who stood motionless against the wall    oh  white aphrodite from the ocean  smitten with divinity  your hand   he began to declaim and choked with laughter   almost   exactly   what  kel   vin      he choked out  coughing  i was still calm  but that calm was beginning to solidify into cold passion    stop  i hissed    stop and get out    youre kicking me out  you too  growing a beard and kicking me out  you no longer want me to warn you  to advise you  as one righteous star companion to another  kelvin  lets open the bottom hatches  well call to him down there  maybe hell hear  but whats his name  think  we named all the stars and planets  or did they already have names  what a usurpation  listen  lets go there  well scream    well tell him what hes done to us until hes horrified    hell build us silver symmetrias and pray for us with his math and hell pelt us with bloody angels and his ordeal will be our ordeal and his fear our fear  and will beg us for an end  because all he is and all he does is begging for an end  why arent you laughing  im only kidding  it may be that if we had more of a sense of humor as a race  this wouldnt have happened  you know what he wants to do  he wants to punish him  this ocean  he wants to make him scream all the mountains at once    do you think he wont have the courage to submit this plan for approval to that sclerotic areopagus who sent us here to redeem what was not his fault  youre right  chicken    but only because of the hat  the hat wont betray anyone  its not that brave  our faust    i was silent  snaut swayed more and more on his feet  tears ran down his face and onto his clothes    who did it  who made us  gi barian  giese  einstein  plato  they were criminals   you know  think  in a rocket a man can burst like a bubble  or coagulate  or boil  or burst into blood so quickly that he doesnt cry out  and then only bones click on the sheet metal  spin in newtonian orbits with einsteins correction  our rattles of progress  and we willingly  because its a beautiful road  until we came  and in these cells  above these plates  among immortal scullerywomen  with a troop of faithful wardrobes  dedicated toilets  here is our realization     look  kelvin  if i wasnt drunk  i wouldnt talk like that  but someone has to say it eventually  someone should  you sit here  you child in the slaughterhouse  and your hair grows    whose fault  answer yourself    he slowly turned around and left  on the threshold he grabbed the door so as not to fall  the echo of footsteps could still be heard coming back towards us from the corridor  i avoided hareys eyes  but our eyes met suddenly  i wanted to go up to her  hug her  stroke her hair  but i couldnt  i could not
