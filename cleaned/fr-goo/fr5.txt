relentlessness  a sort of mute rage  had kept me standing in front of the calculator  now  overwhelmed with fatigue  i no longer knew how to tilt a mechanical bed  forgetting to push back the studs  i hung on the handle and the bedspring collapsed in a single mass  i tore off clothes and laundry  threw them away from me  rolled up in a ball  then i let myself fall on the pillow  i didnt even bother to inflate it properly  i fell asleep without turning off the lamps  i opened my eyes  feeling like i had been dozing for a few minutes  the room was bathed in a red semi darkness  i was less hot  i felt good  i lay there  covers pulled back  completely naked  the curtain veiled only half of the window and there  opposite me  beside the glass lit by the red sun  someone was sitting  i recognized    she wore a white beach dress  the fabric of which was stretched at the tip of the breasts  her legs were crossed  her feet were bare  motionless  her arms outstretched   her arms tanned to the elbow   she looked at me under her black lashes     with his dark hair  slicked back  i gazed at her for a long time  peacefully  my first thought comforted me  i was dreaming and i was aware of dreaming  however  i would have preferred that she disappeared  i closed my eyes and tried to chase away this dream  when i opened my eyes    was sitting across from me  her lips were drawn back  in her usual way  as if about to whistle  but his gaze remained serious  i remembered my speculations the night before about dreams  she hadnt changed since the day i last saw her  she was then a young woman of nineteen  today  she would be twenty nine  but  obviously  the dead do not change  they remain eternally young  she looked at me with her still astonished gaze  i thought i was going to throw something at her head  yet  although it was a dream  i could not bring myself   even in a dream   to mistreat a dead woman  i whispered  poor child  did you come to pay me a visit  the sound of my voice scared me  and the room     everything felt so real  a dream in relief  slightly colored  i saw a number of objects on the floor that i hadnt noticed when i went to bed  when i wake up  i tell myself  ill check to see if these objects are really there  or if  like    i only saw them in a dream  i asked  are you planning to stay long  i noticed that i was speaking in a low voice  in the voice of a man who is afraid of being heard beyond the door  why worry about eavesdroppers in dreams  the sun was rising above the horizon  good sign   i had gone to bed on a red day  which was to be followed by a blue day  followed by another red day  i hadnt slept fifteen hours without interruption  it was a dream  reassured  i looked carefully at    the sun lit it up against the light  the crimson rays gilded the velvety skin of her left cheek and the eyelashes cast a shadow across her face  she was really pretty  and i  even asleep  terribly precise  i watched the movements of the sun  waiting to see the dimple grow in this unusual place  lower than the corner of the lips  however  i would have preferred to wake up  i had to get to work  i clenched my eyelids  i heard a creak  immediately  i opened my eyes    was sitting next to me on the bed  she continued to look at me gravely  i smile at him  she smiled and leaned over  we embraced  a first timid kiss  a kiss of children  then more kisses  i kissed her for a long time  could i thus enjoy a dream  i wondered  i did not betray her memory  it was of her that i dreamed  of her alone  this had never happened to me before  we werent talking  i remained lying on my back  when she lifted her face  i saw her diaphanous nostrils  whose quiverings i had learned to interpret  with my fingertips  i caressed the conch of her ear  where the blood had rushed under my kisses  was it then that i started to worry  i kept telling myself it was a dream  but my heart sank  i flexed my muscles to jump out of bed  i was almost certain to fail  because in dreams  very often  our numbed body slips away  refuses to obey  i hoped  nevertheless  that this attempt would arouse me from sleep  i did not wake up  i sat down  my legs dangling  nothing to do  i had to endure this dream until the end  my good mood was gone  i was scared  i asked   what   i cleared my throat   what do you want  my bare feet felt the ground  looking for a pair of mules  a sharp edge abruptly stopped my toe  i stifled a cry  with satisfaction  i thought that this cry would wake me up  and i remembered that i had no mules  but it went on    backed away  she was leaning against the bed rail  the throbbing heart gently lifted the dress at the tip of the left breast    watched me with quiet interest  quick  a shower  then i tell myself that a shower  in a dream  would not interrupt sleep       where are you from  she grabbed my hand  with a gesture that i knew well  threw it in the air  caught it  fiddled with her fingers and replied  i dont know  you are angry   it was his voice  his voice with deep intonations  his voice a little absent  she always spoke like that   sounding like she didnt care much about the words she was saying  like she was already preoccupied with something else  people thought she was thoughtless  or insolent  because her gaze never changed from an expression of vague astonishment   did  who saw you     i do not know  i arrived uneventful  chris  is it important  she continued to fiddle with my fingers  but her scowling face was no longer participating in the game        what  honey   how did you know where i was   she thinks  a smile   her lips the color of cherries   showed her teeth    no idea  its funny is not it   when i came in  you were sleeping  i didnt wake you up  i didnt wake you up  because youre throwing a tantrum  you have a bad temper  she squeezed my hand harder   did you go downstairs     yes  its all frozen  i spun  she let go of my hand  she stretched out  her head thrown back  all her hair pushed back to the same side  and she looked at me with that half smile that had irritated me before seducing me  i stammered   but     but   i leaned over her and rolled up the short sleeve of her dress  there  above the flower shaped scar left by the smallpox vaccination  there was a red dot  a trace of an injection  i was not surprised  instinctively  i forced myself to probe the implausible to bring together the shreds of a coherent truth  and yet i felt dizzy  i touched that red dot with my finger  which i still dreamed of after so many years  which i had so often dreamed of  immediately waking up with a groan and still finding myself in the same position  bent double among the crumpled sheets  finding myself as i had found her  her  already almost cold  because  while sleeping  i tried to relive what she had experienced  as if  beyond time  i had hoped to obtain her forgiveness or to keep her company for the last few minutes as she felt the effects of the injection and terror washed over her  she  who dreaded a simple scratch  who could not bear the pain  nor the sight of blood  she had deliberately committed this horrible action  leaving only a few scribbled words for me  i had kept his note in my wallet  a faded note  with worn folds  which i never parted with  i didnt have the courage to get rid of it  so many times  i had imagined her writing these words  getting ready to act    i convinced myself that she had put on a comedy  that she had only wanted to frighten me and that the dose  following an error  had proved too strong  everyone suggested to me that it had happened that way  or that it had been a hasty decision  brought on by depression  sudden depression  people didnt know what i had told him five days earlier  they didnt know that  in order to reach her more cruelly  i had taken my things away  and that she  when i was packing my suitcases  had asked very calmly   do you know what that means   and i had pretended not to understand  even though i understood perfectly  but i judged that she was a coward  besides  i had told her  and now  she was lying across the bed and she was looking at me attentively  as if she didnt know that it was i who had killed her  she asked    yes  then  his eyes reflected the red sun  the whole room was red    gazed at her arm with interest  because i had watched it for so long  and when i pulled back  she rested a cool  smooth cheek in the palm of my hand  i stammered     its impossible    shut up  i could make out the movement of his eyes  under the closed eyelids   where are we        with us    where is it   one eye opened and closed instantly  the long eyelashes had tickled my palm    chris    what     i am well  looking up  i saw part of the bed in the mirror above the sink  a loose fall of hair   s hair  and my bare knees  with the tip of my foot  i attracted one of the shapeless objects that i had taken out of the box  i picked it up with my free hand  a rod had melted into a needle  i applied the tip to my skin and dug it in  next to a small pink scar  pain ran through my entire body  i watched the blood flowing  dripping down my inner thigh and dripping soundlessly onto the floor  what good  what good  terrifying thoughts assailed me  distinctly worded thoughts  i had stopped telling myself   its a dream  i no longer believed in a dream  i was like   i have to defend myself  i examined her shoulders  the hips molded in light canvas  the bare feet dangling  i bowed  gently grasping an ankle  then running my fingers under the sole of her foot  the skin was soft  newborn skin  i knew  i no longer doubted  that it wasnt   and i was almost certain that she didnt know herself  the bare foot twitched  a silent laugh swelled  s lips   stop   she whispered  i carefully freed the hand that was supporting her cheek and stood up  i dressed quickly  she straightened up  she was looking at me  i asked him   where are your things   and immediately i regretted my question    my stuff     what  you only have this dress  from now on  i continued the game lucidly  i tried to behave carelessly  indifferently  as if we had parted yesterday   no  as if we had never left each other  she stood up   with a familiar gesture  quick and sure  she pulled up her skirt to smooth it out  my words had troubled her  but she said nothing  for the first time  she surveyed the room with a curious  scrutinizing eye  then  perplexed  she replied    i dont know    she opened the wardrobe door ajar  maybe in there    no  there are only combinations in there  i found an electrical appliance next to the sink and began to shave  careful not to take my eyes off her  she walked back and forth  searching everywhere  finally  glancing out the window  she approached me      i have a feeling somethings happened   she broke off  i had disconnected the razor  i was waiting    i have the impression of having forgotten something  she continued  of having forgotten a lot     i only remember you     i     i do not remember anything else  i listened to him  trying to keep a straight face   did have i been sick   she asked   oh yes  in a way  yes  you have been a little sick    ah  of course  that explains my lack of memory  she had calmed down  i could never describe what i felt  when i watched him coming and going  smiling or serious  speaking or being silent  sitting down and getting up  my terror gave way to the conviction of having   there  in front of me  even as i corrected my judgment and that she seemed to me stylized  reduced to a few expressions  a few gestures  a few characteristic movements  she pressed herself against me  both fists pressed against my chest  at the birth of the neck    where are we  the two of us  is it going well or is it going badly    couldnt be better  she smiled weakly    when you answer like that  its going rather badly  i said hastily    what an idea     darling  i have to go out now  wait for me    and i added  because i was beginning to be terribly hungry  perhaps you would like to eat    eat     she shook her head  tossing the billowing mass of her hair    no  do you have to wait   long    an hour    i am coming with you    you can not come with me  i have to work    i am coming with you  she had changed  it was no longer   at all  the other didnt impose her presence  no  she never imposed herself    its impossible  my little     she looked at me  from bottom to top  suddenly she grabs my hand  and my hand lingered  went up along a warm  full arm  despite myself  i caressed her  my body recognized her body  my body wanted her  my body drew me to her  beyond reason  beyond all thought  beyond fear  careful to remain calm  i repeated      thats impossible  you have to stay here  a single word resounded    no    why    i i dont know   she looked around  then looked up at me again   i cant   she whispered    but why     i do not know  i can not  it seems to me     it seems to me       she was looking for the answer  and when she found it  it was a revelation to her    it seems to me that i must always see you  the decided tone did not lend itself well to the confession of a feeling  it was something quite different  this finding changed suddenly  although not apparent  the nature of my embrace  i held her in my arms  i looked her in the eyes  insensibly  with an instinctive movement  i began to pull her hands back and  when they were joined  my gaze searched the room  i needed a tie to tie his hands  his elbows bumped  a powerful trigger followed  i barely resisted for a second  thrown back and tiptoes barely touching the ground  even an athlete would not have succeeded in freeing himself  but   straightened his waist and drew his arms aside  his face  dimly lit with an uncertain smile  had not taken part in the struggle  she was watching me with quiet interest  just like when i first awoke  as if my desperate attempt hadnt moved her  as if she hadnt noticed anything  like she ignored my panic attack  standing in front of me  she waited   serious  passive  a little surprised  leaving   in the middle of the room  i walked over to the shelf above the sink  i was trapped in a senseless trap and i wanted to get out of it  no matter what  if i had been asked what exactly was going on inside me and what the events meant  i would have been unable to stammer three words  but i already knew that my situation was identical to that of the other inhabitants of the station  that everything i had experienced  learned  or glimpsed  was part of a single whole  terrifying and incomprehensible  however  at the precise moment  i simply contrived to find a trick  to construct a means of escape  without turning away  i felt  s gaze  above the shelf  a small emergency pharmacy was embedded in the wall  hastily  i examined the contents  among the medicines was a bottle of sleeping pills  i uncapped it and threw four pills   maximum dose   into the bottom of a glass  i acted openly  not trying too hard to hide my actions from    why   i didnt ask myself the question  i fill the glass with hot water  when the tablets were dissolved  i walked over to    who had remained standing  she asked me in a low voice    are you angry    no  drink that  i had unconsciously expected that she would obey me  indeed  she silently accepted the glass and drank the hot liquid in one gulp  i put the empty glass on a stool  then i went to sit in the corner of the room  between the cupboard and the bookcase    joined me  she sat down on the floor in her usual way  her legs bent  and with another familiar movement she tossed her hair back  i was no longer mistaken  it wasnt her  yet i recognized her by her least habits  horror constricted my throat  and the worst thing was that i had to trick her  pretend to take her for    when she herself  in good faith  believed she was     i was sure of that  if any certainty could still exist  she had leaned against my knees  her hair brushed my motionless hand  we stayed like that for a long time  from time to time  i glanced at my watch  half an hour passed  the sleeping pill should have started to work    mumbled something    what are you saying   she was silent  i attributed his silence to the torpor of sleep  but  in truth  i secretly doubted the effectiveness of the tablets  why   i didnt have an answer to this question either  because my subterfuge  probably  seemed too easy to me  slowly  her head slid down my lap  dark hair covering her face entirely  she was breathing steadily  she was sleeping  i bent down to carry her to the bed  immediately opening her eyes  she grabbed my neck and burst into a high pitched laugh  i was stunned    couldnt hold back his joy  eyelids close together  she watched me  looking both naive and clever  i sat down again  stiff  bewildered  distraught  a last burst of laughter agitated her  then she snuggled up against my legs  in a toneless voice  i asked   why are you laughing   his face again expressed worried astonishment  obviously  she wanted to give me an honest explanation  she rubbed her little nose and sighed   i dont know   she finally said  genuinely surprised  i behave like an idiot  dont i     but you  too  look like a famous idiot  stuffy like    like pelvis  i seemed to have misheard   like who    like pelvis  you know  the big       there was no way he could have known pelvis  or heard me talk about him  for the simple reason that he had returned from an expedition three years after she was dead  i had not known him before  and i was therefore unaware that he had an inveterate tendency  when he chaired the meetings of the institute  to prolong the sessions indefinitely  his name was pelle villis  and until his return i didnt know that  by contraction  he had been nicknamed pelvis    leaned his elbows on my knees and looked me in the eye  i put my hands on his arms  i went up towards the shoulders and up to the birth of the neck  the low cut dress bared the skin  which throbbed under my fingers  one could assume that i was caressing her  moreover  judging from her look  she did not interpret the touch of my hands otherwise  in fact  i noticed once again that his body was warm to the touch  an ordinary human body  with muscles  bones  joints  gazing quietly into his eyes  i felt the awful desire to suddenly tighten my fingers  suddenly i remembered  s bloody hands  i let go    said quietly   how you look at me  my heart was pounding so hard i couldnt speak  i closed my eyelids  immediately  from start to finish and in detail  i designed an action plan  without wasting a moment  i stood up   i have to get out     if you absolutely want to come with me  ill take you    good  she jumped up  opening the wardrobe and choosing  among the colored shirts  a combination for each of us  i asked    why are you barefoot  she answered in a hesitant voice    i do not know     i had to throw my shoes in a corner  i did not insist   to put this on  youll have to take off your dress    a combination     why  she tried to remove her dress  but a bizarre fact revealed itself  the impossibility of undoing a dress without staples  the red buttons on the bodice were just ornaments  there was no closure whatsoever  zipper or otherwise    smiled  embarrassed  as if it had never been done that way  i picked up a kind of scalpel from the floor and i slit the fabric in the back  from the collar to the waist    was able to pull her dress over her head  when she had put on her jumpsuit  which was a little too loose  and just as we were going out  she asked   are we flying away   you too  yes  i just nodded  i dreaded meeting    but the rotunda was deserted  the door leading to the radio booth was closed  a dead silence  always silence  hovered over the space station    watched my movements carefully  i opened a stall and examined the rocket  i successively checked the condition of the microreactor  the operation of the controls and the diffusers  then  having rid the flared base of its empty capsule  under the funnel shaped cupola  i steered the electric cart carrying the outgoing projectile towards the inclined track  i had chosen a small vehicle used for exchanges of material between the station and the satelloid  and transporting men only on exceptional occasions  because it did not open from the inside  i had chosen it very precisely according to my plan  of course  i was not planning to launch the rocket  but i was simulating the preparations for a real departure     who had accompanied me so many times on my travels  knew a little about preliminary maneuvers  i checked again  in the cockpit  the proper functioning of the air conditioning and the arrival of oxygen  i plugged in the central circuit  the control lamps came on  i came out again and said to    who was standing at the foot of the ladder   come in    and you    ill come in after you   i have to close the hatch behind us  i didnt think she suspected the deception  when she had disappeared inside  i looked up into the opening and asked   are you settled in   i heard a muffled  yes   muffled by the cramped cabin  i bent down and with a single impulse i slammed the hatch  i pushed the two bolts fully  with the key i had prepared  i began to turn the five safety nuts  the sharp cigar stood upright  as if it were really about to soar through space  no danger threatened the captive  the oxygen tanks were full and the cockpit contained provisions  besides  i did not intend to keep her prisoner indefinitely  i desperately wanted two hours of freedom  so that i could concentrate on the decisions to be made and work out a common tactic with    as i turned the penultimate nut  i felt the three pronged fork vibrate around the base of the rocket  i thought i had shaken the support by impetuously wielding my big key  however  when i took a few steps back  i saw a sight that i would rather not have to contemplate a second time  the whole rocket was shaking  shaking from the inside   and what shaking  a steel robot could not have impressed this convulsive tremor on a mass of eight tons  and yet in the cabin of the vehicle was locked only a slender young woman  a young woman with dark hair  on the polished casing of the rocket  the reflections of the lamps quivered  i couldnt hear the knocks  inside the projectile there was absolute silence  but the feet wide apart from the great pedestal vibrated like strings  the rhythm of the tremors was such that i feared seeing the whole scaffolding crumble  i turned the last nut with an unsteady hand  threw away the key and jumped down the ladder  slowly backing up  i noticed that the shock absorbers  designed to withstand continuous pressure  danced furiously  it seemed to me that the envelope of the rocket was wrinkled  like a madman  i jumped to the remote control panel  with both hands  i pulled up the engine start lever  then the loudspeaker attached to the inside of the rocket let out a shrill sound   not a scream  a sound that bore no resemblance to the human voice  and yet i confusedly made out my name  repeated several times       chris  chris  i had rushed at the controls so violently  with such erratic movements  that blood flowed from my scratched fingers  a blue glow  a pale dawn  illuminated the walls  whirlwinds of vaporous dust swirled around the launch pad  the dust turned into a column of violent sparks and the echoes of a powerful rumble drowned out all the other noises  three flames  immediately merged into a single pillar of fire  lifted the rocket  which flew through the opening of the cupola  a fiery furrow rippled as it sank  the shutters closed the orifice of the well  the automatic fans began to draw in the choking smoke that billowed in the room  my mind pieced it all together later  in reality  i dont know what i actually observed  clinging to the control panel  my face cooking over high heat  my hair twisted and grilled  i sucked in jerks the acrid air  with hints of embers mingled with the ozonated scents of ionization  at the time of the launch  i had instinctively closed my eyes  but the blaze had penetrated my eyelids  for a while  i only saw black  red  golden spirals  which gradually moved away  the fans kept moaning  the smoke  the mist  the dust dissipated  i saw the greenish radar screen  hastily manipulating the graduated knobs  i began to look for the rocket  when i located it  it was already flying above the atmosphere  never had i launched a projectile so aberrantly and indiscriminately  without worrying about adjusting the speed and direction  i judged that the easiest way was to place the rocket in a circular orbit around solaris  at a distance of about a thousand kilometers  i could then cut off the thrusters  whose range i did not know  and i feared a catastrophe with incalculable consequences  a thousand kilometer orbit was stationary   i made sure of that by consulting the chart  to be honest  it was no guarantee  but i couldnt imagine any other way out  i didnt have the courage to connect the speaker  disconnected immediately after the launch  no  i didnt want to expose myself to hearing that horrible voice again  which no longer had anything human about it  i considered myself entitled to think that i had conquered the simulacra  beyond appearances  i found    the real    out of respect for his memory  the hypothesis of madness would have effectively meant deliverance  at one oclock i left the space station
