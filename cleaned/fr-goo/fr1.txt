at seven oclock  ships time  i headed for the launch pad  around the well the men lined up to let me pass  i descended the ladder and entered the interior of the capsule  in the narrow cabin  i could hardly spread my elbows  i attached the pump hose to the valve of my suit  which quickly inflated  from now on  it was impossible for me to make the slightest movement  i was there  standing  or rather suspended  wrapped in my pneumatic tracksuit and incorporated into the metal carapace  i looked up  above the transparent globe i saw a smooth wall and  at the very top  moddards head  leaning over the opening of the well  moddard having disappeared  it was suddenly night  the heavy protective cone had been put in place  i heard  repeated eight times  the hum of the electric motors turning the nuts  then the hiss of the compressed air in the shock absorbers  my eyes were getting used to the darkness  i discerned the phosphorescent frame of the single counter  a voice echoed through the headphones   ready     i said   ready  moddard   dont worry about anything  he said  the station will pick you up in flight  have a good trip   there was a creak  the capsule swayed  almost despite myself  i tensed my muscles  no other noise  no other movement occurred    when the departure  i asked  i heard a rustle outside   like a shower of fine sand   youre on your way     good luck  replied moddards voice  as close as before  a slit opened wide at my eye level and i saw the stars  the prometheus sailed around the alpha of aquarius  but i tried in vain to orient myself  sparkling dust filled the porthole  i recognized no constellation  the sky of this region of the galaxy was foreign to me  i waited for the moment when i would pass close to the first distinct star  i was unable to isolate any  their luster diminished  they fled  confused in a vague purple gleam  i thus became aware of the distance covered  the body stiffened  squeezed by my pneumatic envelope  i split the space  with the impression of remaining motionless in the void and with the only diversion the heat which rose slowly  gradually  suddenly there was a squealing  a sharp noise  like the friction of a steel blade on a wet plate of glass  and that was the downfall  if the jumping numbers in the speedometer hadnt told me  i wouldnt have noticed the change in direction  the stars long gone  the gaze was lost  again and again  in the pale red light of infinity  i could hear my heart beating heavily  on the back of my neck  i could feel the cool air from the air conditioner  however  my face was on fire  i regretted not having seen the prometheus  he was probably out of sight when the automatic controls pushed the window shutter aside  a jolt shook the capsule  another jolt followed  the vehicle began to vibrate  penetrating the layers of insulating coatings  crossing my pneumatic envelope  the vibration reached me and communicated itself to my whole body  multiplied  the phosphorescent frame of the counter spread out in all directions  i ignored the fear  i had not undertaken this long journey to go astray beyond the goal  i called   solaris station   solaris station  solaris station  i think im leaving the trajectory  straighten me  solaris station  here the capsule from the prometheus  to you  solaris  i am listening  i had missed the precious moment of the appearance of the planet  it stretched before my eyes  already immense and flat  yet  from the appearance of its surface  i judged that i was still far away  or  more precisely  that i was still very high  since i had crossed the imperceptible border  from which the distance which separates us from a celestial body is measured in terms of altitude  i was falling  now  even closing my eyes  i felt the fall  i hastened to raise my eyelids  for i no longer wanted to miss anything of what there was to see  i waited a minute in silence  then i started calling again  no answer  in the earphones  cracklings followed one another in salvos  on a background of murmur  low and deep  which i imagined to be the very voice of the planet  a veil covered the orange sky and the porthole darkened  instinctively  i curled up as far as my pneumatic garment would allow  almost immediately  i realized that i was going through clouds  as if sucked upwards  the mass of clouds flew away  i hovered  sometimes in light  sometimes in shadow  the capsule turning on itself around a vertical axis  gigantic  the solar ball finally appeared in front of the window  emerging on the left  to disappear on the right  a distant voice came to me through the noise and the crackling   attention  solaris station  here  solaris station  everything is fine  you are under the control of the solaris station  the capsule will land at time zero  i repeat  the capsule will land at time zero  prepare yourselves   watch out  im starting  two hundred and fifty  two hundred and forty nine  two hundred and forty eight  dry meows interspersed the words  an automatic device articulated the words of welcome  that was surprising to say the least  usually  all the men on a space station were eager to greet the newcomer  especially when it arrived directly from earth  i did not have time to wonder for long  because the orbit of the sun  which until then had surrounded me  shifted unexpectedly  and the incandescent disc seemed to dance on the horizon of the planet  sometimes appearing at left  sometimes to the right of it  i swayed like the weight of a giant pendulum  while the planet  a surface streaked with purplish and blackish furrows  rose up in front of me like a wall  my head was beginning to spin when i discovered a small checkerboard of green and white dots   the stations orientation signal  with a snap  something detached from the cone of the capsule  the long necklace of the parachute furiously unfurled its rings and the noise that reached me irresistibly evoked the earth   for the first time  after so many months  the howling of the wind  then everything happened very quickly  until then  i knew i was falling  now i realize it  the green and white chessboard grew rapidly  i saw that it was painted on an elongated body  in the shape of a whale and with silver reflections  the sides of which bristled with radar aerials  i saw that this metallic colossus  pierced by several rows of dark openings  did not rest on the surface of the planet  but was suspended above  casting an ellipsoidal shadow of a more intense black on an inky background  i could make out the slate ripples of the ocean  animated by a weak movement  and suddenly the clouds rose very high  surrounded by a blinding scarlet gleam  beyond  the tawny sky became ashen  distant and flat  and everything faded away  i was falling into a spin  a brief shock stabilized the capsule  through the porthole  i saw again the waves of the ocean  like peaks of sparkling mercury  the ropes suddenly unhooked and the rings of the parachute  carried by the wind  flew in tumult above the waves  oscillating at that very particular slowed down rhythm imparted to it by an artificial magnetic field  the capsule descended gently  i had still had time to glimpse the grids of the launch pads and  at the top of their openwork towers  the mirrors of two radio telescopes  there was a din of steel bouncing off steel  the capsule came to a halt  a hatch opened  and with a long  hoarse sigh  the metal shell that imprisoned me completed its journey  i heard the lifeless voice of the control facility   solaris station  zero and zero  the capsule is placed  end  with both hands  i felt a vague pressure on my chest and the viscera weighed me unpleasantly   i grabbed the levers and i cut the contacts  a green inscription lit up   arrival   the wall of the capsule opened  the air bed pushed me slightly in the back  so that  in order not to fall  i had to take a step forward  with a muffled  resigned hiss  the suit exhaled the air from its pads  i was free  i was under a silver funnel  as high as the nave of a cathedral  bundles of colored pipes ran down the sloping walls and disappeared into rounded orifices  i turned around  the ventilation shafts rumbled  sucking in poisonous gases from the planetary atmosphere  which had seeped in as my vehicle landed inside the station  empty  like a burst cocoon  the cigar shaped capsule stood up  enclosed by a chalice mounted on a steel base  the exterior coating  charred during the trip  had taken on a dirty brown hue  i went down a small ramp  downstairs  the metal floor had been coated with a rough plastic coating  in places  the wheels of the trolleys transporting the rockets had worn away this plastic carpet and the steel showed itself bare  suddenly  the bellows of the fans stopped working and there was absolute silence  i looked around me  a little undecided  waiting for someone to appear  but no one seemed to approach  only a neon arrow blazed  indicating a silent mechanical sidewalk  i let myself be carried forward  the ceiling of the room descended in a beautiful parabolic line  to the entrance of a gallery  in the recesses of the gallery were heaps of compressed gas cylinders  gauges  parachutes  boxes  a quantity of objects thrown in disorder  the mechanical sidewalk dropped me at the end of the gallery  at the threshold of a rotunda  an even more obvious disorder reigned here  a pool of oily liquid spread under a landslide of cans  a nauseous odor filled the air  footprints  sticky spots  were moving away in different directions  a tangle of telegraph tapes  torn papers  all sorts of garbage covered the cans  a green arrow lit up again  pointing me to the central door  behind the door stretched a narrow corridor  where two men could hardly have walked abreast  pavements of glass  embedded in the ceiling  lit up this trench  another door  painted in a green and white checkerboard pattern  it was ajar  i entered  the curved walled cabin had a large panoramic window  crimsoned with a fiery mist  under the window the sooty crests of the waves passed silently  lined up against the walls were open cupboards filled with instruments  books  dirty glasses  heat insulated containers covered in dust  five or six small trolleys and shriveled chairs cluttered the stained floor  only one seat was swollen  the back properly straightened back  in this chair sat a small  skinny man with a sunburned face  the skin on his nose and cheekbones coming off in large patches  i recognized him  it was    a specialist in cybernetics   s substitute  in his time  he had published quite original articles in the solarist e yearbook  i had never had the opportunity to meet him  he wore a net shirt  the stitches of which showed here and there the gray hairs of an emaciated chest  and canvas trousers with multiple pockets  fitters trousers  which had been white and were now stained at the knees and holed by the reagents  he held in his hand one of those plastic pears  which are used to drink in space vehicles not equipped with an internal gravitation system  he gazed at me with a fixed gaze  the pear escaped from his fingers and bounced several times  spilling a bit of transparent liquid  slowly the blood had drained from his face  i was too surprised to speak and this silent scene lasted so long that   imperceptibly communicated his terror to me  i took a step forward  he curled up in his chair  i whispered       he shuddered  as if id punched him  looking at me with indescribable horror  he said in a hoarse voice   i dont know you  i dont know you  what do you want   the spilled liquid evaporated rapidly  i breathed in a whiff of alcohol  he was drinking   he was drunk  but what was he so afraid of  i remained standing in the middle of the cabin  i had limp legs  my ears seemed stuffed with cotton  i felt like the ground beneath my feet wasnt real  behind the curved glass of the window  the ocean was animated by a regular movement    kept his bloodshot eyes on me  terror retreated from his face  the expression of invincible disgust persisted  i asked quietly   whats wrong with you   you are sick   he replied in a muffled voice    youre worried     ah  so  are you worried  why do you care about me  i do not know you  i asked   wheres     his breath failed him  deep in his eyes  glassy again  a light flickered on and off  he stammered   gi    giba    no   no   a stifled laugh  an idiots laugh  shook him completely  then he more or less calmed down   you came for     for    what do you want to do with it  he considered me as if i had instantly ceased to pose a threat to him  in his words  or rather in the tone  there was hatred and provocation  bewildered  i stammered    what     where is he    you do not know   he was obviously drunk  he had completely lost his mind  anger was rising in me  i should have controlled myself and gone out  but patience left me  i yelled   enough   how could i know where he is  since im coming just now     what is going on   his jaw dropped  again his breath caught and a different light lit his eyes  with both hands  he grabs the armrests of the chair  he got up with difficulty  his knees were shaking    what      you come     where are you coming from  he said  almost sobered up  i replied with rage   earth   have you heard of it  it does not look like    from the big sky so youre       yes  why are you looking at me like that  whats amazing about me  he blinked quickly   nothing   he said  wiping his brow   nothing    excuse me     its nothing  i assure you  just surprise    i didnt expect you   to see    what  you did not expect to see me  you were notified several months ago  and moddard telegraphed today from prometheus    yes  yes  of course  only  you see  these days were a little  disorganized  i replied curtly    indeed     i notice    circled around me  inspecting my suit  a very ordinary suit  with the usual harness of wires and cables across the chest  he coughed  felt his bony nose   perhaps you want to take a bath   it would do you good  the blue door on the other side    thank you  i know the layout of the station   perhaps you are hungry    no     where is     without answering  he approached the window  his back turned  he looked distinctly older  the hair  cut short  was gray  deep wrinkles hollowed out the sunburned neck  behind the window shimmered the crests of huge waves  crawling  rising and falling in slow motion  looking at the ocean like this  one had the impression   a mere illusion  certainly   that the station was moving imperceptibly  as if sliding from an invisible pedestal  then she seemed to regain her balance  before leaning to the other side  with the same lazy movement  below  the thick foam  the color of blood  was gathering in the hollow of the waves  for a fraction of a second  my throat constricted and i regretted the severe discipline on board the prometheus  the memory of an existence that suddenly seemed happy to me and gone forever    turned around  rubbing his hands nervously    listen  he said suddenly  for the moment  theres only me  today  youll have to content yourself with my company  call me old rat  and no fuss  since you had seen my photograph  you have only to imagine that you have known me for a long time  everyone calls me old rat  i can do nothing  besides  i suppose its a predestined name  my parents have always had cosmic aspirations  obstinately  i repeated my question    where is    his eyelid fluttered again  im sorry to have greeted you this way  its its not really my fault  i had completely forgotten  a lot has happened here  you understand    its okay  so     hes not in the station  hes on an observation flight    stared at a pile of coiled cables   no  he didnt come out  and it wont fly away  precisely     the ears still clogged  i heard more and more badly and i asked    what     what does that mean  where is he   his voice changed  he answered  you understood very well  he looked me coldly in the eyes  i shivered  he was drunk  but he knew what he was talking about    there was no       yes    an accident   he nodded  nodding vigorously and watching for my reaction    when   this morning  at dawn  i felt an emotion without violence  this exchange of questions and answers had rather calmed me by its conciseness  i began to explain to myself the strange behavior of     what sort of accident    go to your cabin and take that spacesuit off  come back here  in  in  say  an hour  i hesitated for a moment   okay   i finally said  as i was heading for the door  he reminded me    wait  he had a funny look and  if he wanted to add something  the words could not make up his mind to cross his lips  after a while he said    we were three  and now  with you  we are three again  do you know      as i knew you  in photography   hes in the lab up there  and i dont think hell be out before dark  but  youd recognize him anyway   if you saw someone else  you understand  someone who wasnt me or    you understand  then    so what  i was dreaming  it was all just a dream  those black waves  with bloody reflections  under the low sun  and that little man who had just sat back in his chair  his head hanging down again  and who was looking at a pile of cables   then dont do anything  i got carried away    who could i see  a ghost    of course you think im crazy  no  no  im not crazy  i cant tell you anything else right now  besides  maybe  maybe nothing will happen  anyway  dont forget my warning   speak more clearly   what is it about    control yourself  prepare to face  anything  i know its impossible  try anyway  thats the only advice i can give you  i cant find any other  i cried    but what could i face  seeing him sitting there  looking sideways  with his weary  sunburnt head  i could hardly contain myself  i would have liked to grab him by the shoulders and shake him well  painfully  he dropped his words one by one    i do not know  in a way  its up to you   hallucinations    no  its its real  dont attack  and remember what i told you  i didnt recognize my own voice  what are you talking about   we are not on earth  i shouted again   a polythera form   there is absolutely nothing human about them  i was about to throw myself on him  to rouse him from the contemplation which apparently inspired him with these insane remarks  when he murmured   thats why they are formidable   remember what i told you  be on your guard   what happened to     he didnt answer   what is   doing    come back in an hour  i turned away and left  closing the door  i looked at him one last time  small  curled up  his head in his hands and his elbows resting on his stained pants  he remained seated without moving  only then did i notice the clotted blood on the back of both of his hands
