i lay in the dark room  numb  staring at the glowing dial of the watch on my wrist for i dont know how long  i listened to my own breathing and wondered about something  but all of it  the staring at the greenish garland of numbers and wonder  was swathed in an indifference i attributed to fatigue  i turned on my side  the bed was strangely wide  something was missing  i held my breath  there was complete silence  i froze  not the faintest murmur came  harey  why couldnt i hear her breathing  i began to run my hands over the bedclothes  i was alone 
  harey    i wanted to speak up  but i heard footsteps  someone was walking  big and heavy  like   
  gibarian    i said calmly 
  yes  it was me  dont turn on the light 
  no 
  no need  its better for both of us 
  but youre dead 
  its nothing  you recognise my voice after all 
  yes  why did you do it 
  i had to  you were four days late
if you had flown in earlier  maybe you wouldnt have had to  but dont reproach yourself  i dont feel bad 
  are you really here 
  ah  do you think youre dreaming as you thought about harey 
  where is she 
  how do you know i know 
  im guessing 
  keep it to yourself  lets say im here instead of her 
  but i want her to be here too 
  thats impossible 
  why not  look  but you know its really not you  its me 
  no  its really me  if you wanted to be pedantic  you could say its me again  but lets not waste words 
  are you going to leave 
  yes 
  and will she come back then 
  do you care about her  what is she to you 
  its my thing 
  after all  youre afraid of her 
  no 
  and you abhor   
  what do you want from me 
  you can pity yourself  not her  she will always be twenty years old  dont pretend you dont know that 
suddenly  i dont know why  i cooled down  i listened to him quite calmly 
it seemed to me that he was standing closer now  at the foot of the bed  but further on i could see nothing in that darkness 
  what do you want    i asked quietly  my tone seemed to surprise him  he was silent for a moment    sartorius convinced snaut that you tricked him  now they are going to deceive you  they are building a field annihilator under the guise of assembling an x ray apparatus 
  where is it    i asked 
  didnt you hear what i told you  i warned you 
  where is she 
  i do not know  be careful  youll need a gun  you cant count on anyone 
  i can count on harey   i said  i heard a quiet  quick sound  he laughed 
  naturally you can  up to a certain limit  after all  you can always do what i do 
  youre not gibarian 
  please  what are you  your dream maybe 
  no  their puppet  but you dont know that 
  and how do you know who you are 
this got me thinking  i wanted to get up  but i couldnt  gibarian was saying something  i didnt understand the words  all i heard was the sound of his voice  i fought desperately against the weakness of my body  i grumbled once more with my greatest effort and i woke up  i was gasping for air like a half stuffed fish  it was quite dark  a dream  a nightmare  immediately     a dilemma we dont know how to solve  we are persecuting ourselves  polytheria has merely applied a kind of selective amplifier to our thoughts  the search for a motivation for this phenomenon is anthropomorphism  where there are no humans  there are also no motives available to humans  in order to pursue the research agenda  one must either annihilate ones own thoughts or their material realisation  the first is not within our power  the second is too similar to murder   i listened in the darkness to the steady  distant voice  the sound of which i recognised immediately  it was gibarian speaking  i stretched my hands out in front of me  the bed was empty 
ive woken up to another dream   i thought 
  gibarian       i spoke up  the voice broke off immediately  half a word  something clicked quietly and i felt a faint blast on my face 
  well you  gibarian   i muttered with a yawn    so from sleep to stalk  you know    
something rustled beside me 
  gibarian    i repeated louder  the bed springs vibrated 
  kris    its me      a whisper sounded right next to me 
  its you  harey    and gibarian 
  kris    kris    hes not    you yourself said he was dead   
  in a dream he might be alive   i said absentmindedly  i wasnt at all sure it was a dream anymore    he was saying something  he was here   i chuckled  i was terribly sleepy  since im sleepy  im asleep  i thought idiotically  brushed my lips against hareys cool shoulder and settled down more comfortably  she answered me something  but i had already plunged into oblivion 
in the morning  in the red lit room  i recalled the events of that night  the conversation with gibarian i had dreamt  but then  i could hear his voice  i could swear to it  i just couldnt remember very well what he was saying  it didnt sound like a conversation  more like a lecture  a lecture     harey was washing herself  i heard the splash of water in the bathroom  i looked under the bed where i had crammed the tape recorder a few days ago  it wasnt there 
  harey    i called out  her dripping face appeared from behind the wardrobe 
  didnt you happen to see a tape recorder under the bed  a small  pocket sized one   
  there were all sorts of things lying there  i put everything there   she pointed to a shelf by the medicine cabinet and disappeared into the bathroom  i jumped out of bed  but the search was fruitless 
  you must have seen him  i said when she came back into the room  she answered nothing  combing her hair in front of the mirror  only now did i notice that she was pale  and there was something studied in her eyes when they met mine in the mirror 
  harey  i began like a donkey once more  the tape recorder is not on the shelf 
  dont you have anything more important to tell me    
  im sorry   i muttered   youre right  its silly 
just what we needed to start arguing 
we went to breakfast afterwards  harey was doing everything differently today than usual  but i couldnt tell the difference  she was looking at her surroundings  a few times not hearing what i was saying to her  as if falling into a sudden stupor  once  when she raised her head  i saw that her eyes were glazing over 
  whats wrong with you    i lowered my voice to a whisper    are you crying 
  oh  leave me alone  these are not real tears   she howled  i shouldnt have stopped there  perhaps  but i was afraid of nothing so much as frank talk  i had  moreover  something else on my mind  although i knew that the scheming of snaut and sartorius was only dreaming  i began to consider whether there were any handy weapons on the station at all  what i would do with it i hadnt thought about  i just wanted to have it  i told harey that i needed to take a look in the cargo bay and in the storerooms  she followed me  silently  i shuffled through the crates  snooped in the bins  and when i got down to the sarn pit  i couldnt resist the urge to look in the cooler  i didnt want harey in there  though  so i just swung the door open and circled the whole room with my eyes  the dark shroud bloated  covering the elongated shape  but from where i stood i could not see if the black was still lying where it had been before  it seemed to me that the place was empty  i couldnt find anything that suited me  and i wandered around in a worse and worse mood  until i suddenly realised that i couldnt see harey  she came immediately   she stayed in the corridor   but the fact that she was trying to get away from me  which was so difficult  even for a moment  should have made me wonder  still  i acted like i was offended at not knowing who or just like a moron  i got a headache  couldnt find any powders and  angry as all hell  turned the entire contents of the first aid kit upside down  into the operating theatre again i didnt want to go  i was so un emotional that day as rarely  harey was pacing around the cabin like a shadow  sometimes disappearing for a while  and in the afternoon  after we had eaten lunch  actually she hadnt eaten at all  and i  with no appetite due to my head bursting with pain  hadnt even tried to encourage her to eat   she suddenly sat down next to me and started plucking at the sleeve of my blouse 
  well  whats up    i muttered machinically 
i felt like going upstairs  because it seemed to me that the pipes carried a faint knocking echo  indicating that sartorius was rummaging through the high voltage apparatus  but at once i was put off by the thought that i would have to go with harey  whose presence in the library still half explained  there  among the machines  might give snaut the opportunity for some untimely remark 
  kris  she whispered  how is it with us     i sighed in spite of myself  i cant say it was my lucky day 
  as good as it could be  whats it all about again 
  id like to talk to you 
  please  im listening 
  but not like this 
  how  well  i told you  you know  ive got a headache  ive got a lot of problems    
  a little goodwill  kris  i forced myself to smile  he was certainly miserable 
  yeah  love  go ahead 
  and will you tell me the truth  i raised my eyebrows  i didnt like that kind of start    why would i lie 
  you might have reasons  serious ones  but if you want me to    you know    then dont lie to me 
i kept quiet 
  ill tell you something and you tell me something  all right  its going to be the truth  no matter what 
i didnt look her in the eye  although she sought my gaze  i pretended not to see it 
  i already told you i dont know how i got here  but maybe you do know  wait  theres still me  maybe you dont know  but if you do know  just cant tell me now  then maybe later  sometime 
that wont be the worst thing  in any case  youll give me a chance 
i felt like an icy current was running through my whole body 
  child  what are you saying  what chance       i mumbled 
  kris  whoever i am  a child im certainly not  you promised  say 
this whoever i am grabbed me by the throat so much that i could only stare at her  stupidly denying with my head  as if i was defending myself from hearing everything 
  after all  im explaining to you that you dont have to tell me  its enough if you say you cant 
  im not hiding anything       i replied coolly 
  thats perfect   she replied standing up  i wanted to say something  i felt i couldnt leave her like this  but all the words were bogging down in my throat 
  harey   
she stood at the window with her back turned  the dark blue  empty ocean lay against the naked sky    harey  if you think    harey  after all you know i love you    
  me 
i walked up to her  i wanted to embrace her  she extricated herself  pushing my arm away    you are so good       she said    do you love me  id rather you beat me    harey  love 
  no  no  youd better keep quiet now 
she walked over to the table and started collecting plates  i stared into the dark blue void  the sun was receding and the great shadow of the station moved steadily in the waves  a plate slipped out of hareys hands and fell to the floor  water bubbled in the dishwater  the reddish hue transitioned to a dirty reddish gold at the edge of the sky  if i had known what to do  oh  if i had known  at once it became quiet 
harey stood right behind me 
  no  dont turn around  she said  lowering her voice to a whisper    youre not guilty of anything  kris  i know  dont worry 
i held out my hand towards her  she ducked into the cabin and  picking up a whole stack of plates  said 
  pity  if they could break  id smash  oh  id smash them all   
for a moment i thought she was really pressing them to the ground  but she looked at me sharply and smiled 
  dont be afraid  i wont make a scene 
i woke up in the middle of the night  instantly compressed and alert  and sat up on the bed  the room was dark  with a faint light coming from the corridor through the ajar door  something was hissing venomously  the sound increasing along with muffled  dull thumps  as if something large was slamming violently behind the wall  a meteor    a thought flashed    it had pierced the armour  someones in there  a protracted grunt 
i sobered to the core  it was the station  not a rocket  and that awful sound    
i rushed out into the corridor  the door of the small workshop was open wide  it was glowing in there 
i ran inside 
a whiff of monstrous cold enveloped me  the cabin was filled with steam cutting the breath into snow  full of white flakes circled over a bathrobe wrapped body that thudded feebly on the floor  i could barely see her  in that icy cloud  i threw myself at her  grabbed her in half  the coat steaming my hands  she lashed out  i ran out into the corridor  past the rows of doors  i could no longer feel the cold  only her breath coming from her mouth in clouds of steam like a flame burning my shoulder  i deposited her on the table  ripped the cloak over her breasts  stared for a second into her sinewy  twitching face  the blood froze on her open mouth  covered her lips with a black coating  ice crystals glistened on her tongue   liquid oxygen 
there was liquid oxygen in the studio  in the dewars vessels  lifting her up  i could feel myself crushing the crisp glass  how much could she drink  all the same  scorched trachea  throat  lungs  liquid oxygen chews harder than concentrated acids  her breathing  raspy  dry like the sound of tearing papers  was shallow  her eyes were closed  agony 
i looked at the huge glassed in cabinets of instruments and medicines  a tracheotomy  intubation  but the lungs are gone  they are burnt out  medicines  so many medicines  rows of coloured bottles and boxes filled the shelves  snoring filled the entire room  still a mist flowed from her open mouth 
thermophores   
i started looking for them  but before i found them i jumped to the other cupboard  threw boxes of ampoules  now a syringe  where  in the sterilisers  i couldnt put it together with my grubby hands  my fingers were stiff and wouldnt bend  i began furiously banging my hand against the steriliser lid  but i couldnt feel it  the only response was a faint tingling  lying down she moaned louder  i jumped over to her  her eyes were open 
  harey 
it wasnt even a whisper  i couldnt get my voice out  my face was alien  obtuse  as if made of plaster  her ribs flew under her white skin  her hair  damp from the melting snow  spilled over the headboard  she was looking at me 
  harey 
i couldnt say anything more  i stood like a block with those alien  wooden hands  my feet  my lips  my eyelids beginning to burn more and more  but i hardly felt it  a drop of blood dissolving in the warmth ran down her cheek  drawing a slanting line  her tongue twitched and disappeared  she still lashed out 
i took hold of her wrist  it was pulseless  stretched the coat halves and put my ear to the frighteningly cold flesh just below her breasts  through a crackling noise like a fire i heard a thud  galloping tones  too fast to count  i stood  stooped low  with my eyes closed  when something touched my head  she slid her fingers into my hair  i looked into her eyes 
  kris   she howled  i grabbed her hand  she responded with a squeeze that almost crushed my hand  consciousness fled from her horribly contorted face  the whites went bald between her eyelids  there was a snarl in her throat and torpor racked her entire body  i could barely hold her up  slung over the edge of the table  she was banging her head against the edge of the porcelain funnel  i held her up and pressed her against the table  with each successive spasm she tore herself out of me  instantly i was drenched in sweat and my legs became like cotton wool  when the torsion subsided  i tried to lay her down  she was drinking grasping for air  suddenly hareys eyes lit up in that horrible  bloody face 
  kris  she whimpered  how    how long  kris 
she started to choke  foam came up to her lips  the torpor was jerking her again  i held her with the last of my strength  she fell on her back until her teeth rang  and she was panting 
  no  no  no   she threw out quickly with each exhalation and each seemed to be the last  but the torsion returned once more  and again she threw herself into my arms  drawing in air in short pauses with an effort from which all her ribs protruded  at last her eyelids half slid over her open  blind eyes  she froze  i thought it was over  i didnt even try to wipe the pink foam from her mouth  i stood over her  bent over  hearing some distant  great bell  and waited for her last breath to fall to the floor after it  but she was still breathing  almost without rales  quieter and quieter  and the tip of her breast  which had almost completely stopped twitching by now  moved with the rapid rhythm of her working heart  i stood  crestfallen  and her face was beginning to turn pink  i comprehended nothing yet  only the insides of both my hands grew damp and i seemed to go deaf  something soft and pliable filling my ears  but i could still hear the tolling bell  now deaf as if with a broken heart 
she lifted her eyelids and our eyes met 
  harey  i wanted to say  but my mouth seemed to run out  my face was a dead  heavy mask and i could only stare 
her eyes circled the room  her head moved  it was quite quiet  behind me  in some other distant world  water dripped evenly from an untightened tap  she raised herself up on her elbow  she sat down  i stepped back  she was watching me 
  what  she said  what     no    succeeded  why     why are you looking at me like that     and suddenly  in a terrible scream 
  why are you looking like that    silence fell  she looked at her hands  she moved her fingers 
  is it me       she said 
  harey   i pronounced breathlessly  with my lips alone  she raised her head 
  harey       she repeated  she slid slowly to the floor and stood up  she wobbled  regained her balance  took a few steps  she did all this in a sort of stupor  looking at me and as if she didnt see me 
  harey    she repeated slowly again    but    i    i am not harey  and who   me    harey  and you  you 
suddenly her eyes widened  lit up  and the shadow of a smile  of supreme amazement lit up her face 
  how about you  too  kris  maybe you too  i remained silent  leaning with my back against the wardrobe where fear had pushed me  her hands dropped 
  no  she said   no  because youre scared  but  listen  i cant after all  you cant do that  i didnt know anything  now  i still dont understand anything  its not possible  i   she pressed her clenched  faded hands to her chest   i know nothing  except  except harey  do you think i am pretending  i am not pretending  holy word  i am not pretending 
the last words passed into a groan  she fell to the floor  sobbing  that cry as if it shattered something inside me  with one leap i reached her  snatched her by the shoulders  she defended herself  pushed me away sobbing without tears  screaming 
  let go  let go  youre disgusting  i know  i dont want to  i dont want to  after all  you see  you can see for yourself that its not me  not me  not me    
  shut up    i shouted shaking her  we both screamed unconsciously  kneeling in front of each other  hareys head was flying  thrashing against my shoulder  i pressed her against me with all my strength  suddenly we froze  panting heavily  water dripped steadily from the tap 
  kris      she whimpered pressing her face into my shoulder   tell me what to do so i wont be there  kris    
  stop it    i shouted  she raised her face  she stared at me 
  how     you dont know either  cant anything be helped  nothing 
  harey    have mercy   
  i wanted to    you saw  no  no  let go  i dont want you to touch me  youre disgusting 
  youre not 
  youre lying  you must be disgusted  i    myself    too  if i could  if i could   
  you would have killed yourself 
  yes 
  and i dont want to  do you understand  i dont want you to kill yourself  i want you to be here  with me    i dont need anything else 
the huge grey eyes were engulfing me 
  how you lie      she said quite quietly 
i let her go and got up from my knees  she sat down on the floor 
  tell me  what do i have to do to make you believe that i am saying what i think  that it is the truth  that there is no other 
  you cant tell the truth  i am not harey 
  and who are you 
she was silent for a long moment  her chin twitched a few times until  lowering her head  she whispered 
  harey    but    but i know its not true  its not me    you loved there  before   
  yes   i said    what was there is gone  that has died  but you  here  i love  do you understand 
she shook her head 
  you are good  dont think to yourself that i dont know how to judge all that you did  you did the best you could  but theres no help for that  when i sat by your bed in the morning three days ago and waited for you to wake up  i didnt know anything  it seems to me as if it was a very  very long time ago  i was acting like i was out of my mind  i had a kind of fog in my head  i couldnt remember what had come before and what had come after  and i wasnt surprised by anything  like after anaesthesia or a long illness  and i even thought maybe i was ill  you just dont want to tell me  but then more and more things made me think  you know what kind of things  something was already dawning on me after that conversation you had there  in the library  with whats his name  with snaut  and because you didnt want to say anything  i got up at night and played that tape recorder  i only lied that one time  because i hid it afterwards  kris  the one that said  what was his name 
  gibarian 
  yes  gibarian  by then i understood everything  although to be honest  i still dont understand anything  one thing i didnt know was that i couldnt    that i wasnt    that it would end like this     indefinitely  he didnt say anything about that  maybe he was talking  anyway  but you woke up and i turned the tape off  still  i heard enough to know that im not a human being  but an instrument    what are you saying 
  yes  to test your reactions or something like that  every one of you has one  like me  its based on memories or on imaginations  repressed  somehow  anyway  you know all this better than me  he said such terrible  unbelievable things and if it didnt all add up  i probably wouldnt have believed it 
  what did it all add up to 
  well  that i dont need sleep and that i need to be still with you  yesterday morning i still thought that you hated me  and i was unhappy about it  god  how stupid i was  but tell me  tell me yourself  could i have imagined it  after all  he didnt hate this one of his at all  but how he talked about her  only then did i realise that whatever i did  it was all the same  because whether i wanted to or not  for you it must be just like torture  and actually even worse  because the instrument of torture is as dead and innocent as a stone that can fall and kill  and for an instrument to be able to wish and love well  i couldnt imagine that  i would like to tell you at least what was going on in me then  afterwards  how i understood  how i listened to the tape  maybe you would have at least had a use for it  i even tried to write it down   
  is that why you turned the light on    i asked  struggling to get my voice out with a suddenly choked throat    yes  but nothing came of it  because i was looking within myself  you know       them   that something else  i was completely mad  i tell you  it seemed to me for a while that i didnt have a body under my skin  that there was something else inside me  that i was just  just a surface  to deceive you  do you understand 
  i understand 
  when you lie like that for hours at night  you can go very far and in very strange directions with your thoughts  you know    
  i know   
  but i felt my heart  and anyway i remembered that you tested my blood  what is my blood  tell me  tell me the truth  after all  you can now 
  the same as mine 
  really 
  i swear to you 
  what does that mean  you know  i thought afterwards that maybe it was hidden somewhere inside me  that it was     it could be very small  but i didnt know where  i think now that it was basically prevarication on my part  because i was very afraid of what i wanted to do  and i was looking for some other way out  but  kris  if i have the same blood     if it is as you say  then     no  thats impossible  after all  i wouldnt be alive anymore  would i  i mean  there is something after all  but where  maybe in my head  but after all  i think quite simply     and i dont know anything    if i thought that  i should know everything at once and not love you  just pretend and know that i am pretending     kris  please tell me everything you know  maybe something can be done after all    what should be able to be done  she was silent 
  do you want to die 
  i think i do 
there was silence again  i stood over her  hunched over  looking at the empty interior of the room  at the white slabs of enamelware  at the gleaming  scattered tools  as if looking for something badly needed  and i couldnt find it 
  harey  can i say something too  she waited 
  its true that youre not quite like me  but that doesnt mean youre something inferior 
on the contrary  you can think what you want  by the way  but thanks to this     you didnt die  some kind of childish  pathetic smile came over her face 
  does that mean that i am    immortal 
  i dont know  in any case  you are far less mortal than i am 
  thats terrible  she whispered 
  maybe not as much as you think 
  but you dont envy me    
  harey  its more a question of your     destiny  i would call it  you know  here on the station  your destiny is essentially as dark as mine and everyone elses  the others there will continue the gibarian experiment and anything can happen    
  or nothing 
  or nothing  and ill tell you that id prefer nothing to happen  not even because of fear  although it probably plays a part too  i dont know   but because it wont do anything  that is one thing i am absolutely sure of 
  nothing will  and why  its all about the    ocean 
she shuddered 
  yes  its about contact  i think its actually remarkably simple  contact implies an exchange of some experience  of concepts  or at least of results  of some states  but if there is nothing to exchange  if an elephant is not a very big bacterium  then the ocean cannot be a very big brain  from both sides there can  of course  be some action  the result of one is that i am now looking at you and trying to explain to you that you are dearer to me than the twelve years of my life that i have devoted to solaris  and that i want to continue to be with you  maybe your appearance was meant to be a torture  maybe a favour  or maybe just a microscopic examination  an expression of friendship  a sneaky jab  maybe a taunt  maybe all of the above at the same time  or   which seems most likely to me   something else entirely  but what could you and i really care about the intentions of our parents  however different they may have been  you may say that our future depends on those intentions  and i would agree with that  i cannot predict what will be  neither can you  i cannot even assure you that i will always love you  if so much has already happened  anything can happen  maybe i will become a green jellyfish tomorrow  it doesnt depend on us  but in that  which depends on us  we will be together  is that not enough 
  listen      she said   there is something else  am i    am i like her    very much like her 
  you were very much like her   i said   but now i dont know 
  what do you mean    
she stood up from the ground and looked at me with big eyes 
  you have already obscured her 
  and are you sure it wasnt her  but me  me    
  yes  you  i dont know  im afraid that if you really were her  i couldnt love you    why 
  because i did something terrible 
  her 
  yes  when we were   
  dont tell me 
  why 
 because i want you to know that im not her
