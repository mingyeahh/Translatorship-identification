the corridor was empty  it led straight at first  then curved to the right  i had never been to the station  but for six weeks i had lived   as part of my initial training   in an exact copy of it  located in the institute  on earth  i knew where the stairs with aluminium steps led  the library was unlit  in the dark  i found the contact  when i searched the file for the first volume of the solarian yearbook  along with an appendix  a red light came on when i pressed a key  i checked in the recorder   the book was at  s  as was the other one   that little apocrypha  i turned off the light and went back downstairs  i was afraid to go into his cabin despite the footsteps i had heard before  it might have come back there  i stood in front of the door for some time until  clenching my jaws  i forced myself through and entered 
the illuminated room was empty  i started  flipping through the books lying on the floor by the window  at one point i walked over to the wardrobe and closed it  i couldnt look at the empty space between the suits  there was no annexe under the window  i methodically rearranged volume after volume until  having reached the last pile of books resting between the bed and the wardrobe  i found the volume i was looking for 
i hoped to find a clue in it  and indeed   there was a bookmark stuck in the index of names  in red pencil was circled a name that told me nothing  andre berton  it appeared on two different pages  i looked first at the earlier place and learned that berton was the reserve pilot of the shan nahana ship  the next mention of him was upwards of a hundred pages further on  immediately after landing  the expedition proceeded with extreme caution  but when  after sixteen days  it became apparent that the plasmatic ocean was not only showing no signs of aggressiveness  but was retreating from any object approaching its surface and  as it might  avoiding direct contact with cameras or people  shannahan and his deputy timo lis lifted some of the precautionary dictates to proceed  as they were making the work exceedingly difficult and delaying 
the expedition was then broken up into small groups of two and three  making flights of several hundred miles over the ocean at times  the blasters previously used as cover  closing off the work area  were placed at the base  the first four days after this change in methodology passed without incident  apart from occasional damage to the oxygen equipment in the suits  as the exhaust valves proved sensitive to the corrosive effects of the poisonous atmosphere  as a result  they had to be changed almost daily for new ones 
on day five  and the twenty first counting from the time of landing  two researchers  carucci and fechner  the first was a radiobiolo g and the second a physicist   made an exploratory flight over the ocean in a small two man aeromobile  it was not a flying vehicle  but a glider that moves on a cushion of condensed air 
when  after six hours  they did not return  ti molis  who had been in charge of the base in shannahans absence  sounded the alarm and sent all available men to search for them  by a fatal coincidence  radio communications broke down that day  about an hour after the exploration groups had left  the cause was a large red sunspot  sending strong corpuscular larne radiation into the upper layers of the atmosphere  only the ultra short wave instruments were working  allowing communication over distances of no more than twenty odd miles  to make matters worse  by sunset the fog had thickened and the search had to be discontinued 
even as the rescue teams were returning to the base  one discovered the aeromobile  just 80 miles offshore  the engine was running and the machine  undamaged  was hovering above the waves  in the transparent cabin was only one  semi conscious man   carucci  the aeromobile was brought to the base and ca rucci was treated medically  he returned to consciousness later that evening  he could say nothing about fechners fate  he only remembered that  just as they were about to return  he began to feel short of breath  the exhalation valve of his apparatus was jammed and a small amount of poisonous gases entered the suit with each inhalation 
in an attempt to fix his apparatus  fechner had to unbuckle his belts and stand up  this was the last thing carucci remembered  the supposed course of events was   according to the experts assessment   as follows  while repairing ca ruccis apparatus  fechner opened the roof of the cabin  probably because he could not move freely under the low dome  this was permissible  as the cabin of such machines is not airtight and is only a shelter from the weather and wind  during these manipulations  fechners oxygen apparatus must have malfunctioned and  dazed  he climbed up  climbed out through the dome opening onto the back of the machine and fell into the ocean 
such is the story of the oceans first victim  the search for the body   it should have been floating on the waves in a wetsuit   yielded no results  then again  it might have floated  a thorough sweep of thousands of square miles of almost constantly fog shrouded  rolling desert was beyond the capabilities of the expedition 
by dusk   returning to the accidents of the previous day   all apparatus had returned  rescue except for the large cargo helicopter on which berton flew out   
he appeared over the base almost an hour after darkness fell  when he was already seriously feared  he was in a state of nervous shock  he got out of the apparatus with his own strength only to throw himself into flight  restrained  he screamed and cried  in a man who had had seventeen years of space navigation in sometimes the harshest conditions  this was astonishing 
the doctors surmised that berton too had succumbed to poisoning  after two days  berton  who even when he had regained his apparent equilibrium  refused to leave the interior of the expeditions main rocket for a moment or even to approach the window from which the view of the ocean opened up  declared that he wished to report on his flight  he insisted on this  claiming that it was of the utmost importance  this report  after being examined by the expeditions council  was considered a morbid creation of the mind  poisoned by the gases of the atmosphere  and as such was added not to the expeditions history  but to bertons medical history  and that was the end of the whole thing 
thats what the appendix said  i guessed that the crux of the matter was  of course  bertons report itself   what had driven this long range pilot to a nervous breakdown  i took to leafing through the books for the second time  but little apocrypha was nowhere to be found  i was growing tired  so i postponed further searching until tomorrow and left the cabin  as i passed the aluminium staircase  i saw patches of incident light lying on the steps  so   was still working  at this hour  i thought i should see him 
it was a little warmer upstairs  a faint breeze gushed through the wide  low corridor  strands of paper furled memorably over the ventilation outlets  the door of the main laboratory was formed by a thick slab of rough glass  framed by a metal frame  on the inside  the glass was obscured by something dark  light came only through narrow  under suffixed windows  i pressed the bar  as i expected  the door did not give in  it was silent inside  with the occasional faint screech of a sort of gas flame  i knocked   no answer 
       i called out    dr    its me  the new one     i need to see you  please  open up 
a faint rustle  as if someone were treading on crumpled paper  and silence again 
  its me     after all  youve heard of me  i flew prometheus a few hours ago    i cried out  bringing my mouth close to where the door met the metal frame    dr     theres no one here but me  open the door for me 
silence  then a faint murmur  a few clinks  very distinct  as if someone was placing metal tools on a metal tray  and at once i was stunned  a series of tiny footsteps sounded  as if a child were trotting  the dense  hurried thrashing of little feet  i think    someone must have imitated them with extremely skilful fingers on some hollow  well resonating box 
  dr         i roared    are you opening or not  
no answer  just that childish trot again and at the same time a few quick  faintly audible  sweeping steps  as if the man were walking on tiptoe  but if he was walking  couldnt he at the same time imitate the gait of a child  what do i care anyway    i thought and  no longer able to hold back the rage that was beginning to seize me  i banged on    dr       i didnt fly for sixteen months to be stopped by your comedies    i count to ten  then ill blow the doors off   
i doubted if i would succeed 
the recoil of a gas pistol is not very strong  but i was determined to carry out my threat one way or the other  even if i had to go in search of explosives  of which there was certainly no shortage in the warehouse  i told myself that i must not give in  that is  i must not keep playing with the madness marked cards that the situation was pushing into my hands  there was a sound as if someone was struggling with someone or pushing something  the curtain in the middle moved away maybe half a metre  a slender shadow fell on the surface of the frosted door  and a slightly hoarse dashing voice spoke 
  i will open  but you must promise not to go inside 
  then why do you want to open    i roared 
  i will go out to you 
  good  i promise 
there was a light clatter of a key being turned in the lock  then a dark silhouette  covering half the door  carefully drew the curtain back  some intricate operations were going on there   i heard the creaking as if of a wooden table being moved  and finally the bright panel   it swung open just enough for   to slip through into the corridor  he stood in front of me  covering the doorway with himself  he was remarkably tall  skinny  under his cream coloured leotard  his body seemed to consist of nothing but bones  his neck was wrapped in a black handkerchief  over his shoulder hung a protective laboratory coat folded in two  scorched with reagents  he held his extremely narrow head sideways  almost half his face was obscured by curved black glasses  so that i could not see his eyes  he had a long lower jaw  a bluish mouth and huge ears  as if frostbitten  because they were also bluish  he was unshaven  from his wrists dangled on loops were counter gloves of red rubber  we stood like that for a while  looking at each other with unconcealed dislike  the remains of his hair  he looked as if he had shaved himself with a hedgehog razor  were leaden  his beard quite grey  his forehead was tanned  like  s  but the tan ended about halfway up in a horizontal line  apparently he wore some sort of myck constantly in the sun 
  im listening  he said at last  it seemed to me that he wasnt so much waiting to hear what i was about to say to him as listening with intensity to the space beyond  still clinging with his back to the glass panel  for a good while  i didnt know how to speak so as not to shoot myself silly    my name is      you must have heard of me   i started    i am  i mean    i was an associate of      
his lean face  all in vertical lines   that must have been what donkisjot looked like   was expressionless  the black curved plate of the glasses pointed at me made it extremely difficult to speak 
  i found out that       was dead    i suspended my voice 
  yes  im sorry    it sounded impatient 
  did he commit suicide     who found the body  you or   
  why are you turning to me with this  didnt dr   tell you    
  i wanted to hear what you had to say on the matter    
  are you a psychologist  dr   
  yes  why 
  a scientist 
  well  yes  whats the connection   
  i thought you were a crime official or a police officer  it is now two forty  and you  instead of trying to get involved in the flow of the work going on at the station  which would have been ultimately understandable  despite this brutal attempt to force your way into the laboratory  are questioning me as if i were at least a suspect 
i mastered myself with an effort from which sweat broke out on my forehead 
  you are a suspect       i said in a stifled voice 
i wanted to placate him at all costs  so i added fiercely 
  and you know it perfectly well 
  if you dont take it back and apologise to me  ill complain about you in a radio report    
  what do i have to apologise to you for  for the fact that instead of accepting me  instead of giving me a fair introduction to what you are going through  you lock yourself up and barricade yourself in the laboratory  have you completely lost your mind  who are you   a scientist or a miserable coward   what  why dont you answer me     i dont know what i shouted myself  he didnt even flinch  thick drops of sweat were trickling down his pale  porous skin  suddenly i realised  he wasnt listening to me at all  he hid both hands behind him  held the door with all his strength  which trembled slightly as if someone was pushing against it from the other side 
  let    you    go away      he groaned at once in a strange  squeaky voice    go away    for gods sake  go downstairs  ill come  ill come  ill do whatever you want  but go   
such was the agony in his voice that  quite stupefied  i raised my hand reflexively  wanting to help him hold the door  as that was clearly what he was struggling for  but he then let out a horrible scream  as if i had swung a knife at him  so i started to retreat backwards  then he kept shouting in a falsetto  go  go     then again  im coming back now  im coming back now     no  no    
he swung the door open and dashed inside  it seemed to me that something golden flashed at the height of his chest  as if some kind of shining disc  a deafening rumble was now coming from the laboratory  the curtain flew to the side  a great tall shadow flitted across the glass screen  the curtain returned to its place and nothing more could be seen  what was happening there  footsteps stomped  a frantic scurry broke off with a shrill  glassy rumble and i heard the shrill laughter of a child    
my legs shook beneath me  i looked around in all directions  there was silence  i sat down on the low plastic window sill  i sat there for perhaps a quarter of an hour  i dont know whether i was waiting for something or just so driven that i didnt even want to get up  my head was pounding  somewhere  high up  i heard a prolonged grinding and at the same time the surroundings brightened 
from where i was sitting  i could only see part of the circular corridor that encircled the laboratory  it was located at the very top of the station  just below the shield of the top armour  so the outer walls were concave and sloping  with windows placed every few metres  like shooting galleries  the obscuring flaps from the outside were just rising  the blue day was coming to an end  a dazzling glare burst through the thick glass  every nickel trim  every handle lit up like a small sun  the door to the laboratory   that great slab of rough glass   glowed like the opening of a furnace  i stared at my hands  gray in this ghastly light  folded in my lap  in my right hand i held a gas pistol  i had no idea when or how i had snatched it from its case  i let it back in there  i already knew that not even an atomic thrower would help me  what could i do with it  break down the door  break into the laboratory  i stood up  a shield collapsing into the ocean  like a hydrogen explosion  sent a horizontal burst of rays behind me  almost material  when they hit my cheek  i was already going down the steps   it was like applying a hot seal 
halfway down the stairs i blushed and went back up  i walked around the laboratory  as i said  a corridor surrounded it  having walked a hundred steps or so  i found myself on the other side  facing a completely similar glass door  i didnt try to open it  i knew it was locked 
i was looking for a window in the plastic wall  even a crack of some kind  the thought of peeping at   did not seem at all unworthy of me  i wanted to put an end to conjecture and find out the truth  although i couldnt imagine how i would be able to understand it 
it occurred to me that the light was given to the laboratory halls by ceiling windows  that is to say  placed in the top armour  and if i got outside  i could  perhaps  look in through them  in order to do this  i had to go downstairs to get a suit and an oxygen apparatus  i stood at the foot of the stairs  wondering if the game was worth the candle  it was quite likely that the glass of the upper windows was frosted  but what was left for me  i descended to the middle level  i had to walk past the radio station  the door was open wide  he was sitting in an armchair just as i had left him 
he was asleep  at the sound of my footsteps he twitched and opened his eyes 
  hello       he spoke up in an ochre voice  i remained silent 
  well  did you find out anything    he asked 
  yes   i replied slowly    he is not alone 
he curled his lips 
  well  there you go  thats something  he has visitors  you say 
  i dont understand why you dont want to tell me what it is   i threw it out as if out of the blue    after all  staying here ill find out sooner or later anyway  so why all the secrecy 
  youll understand when you have guests yourself   he said  it looked to me like he was waiting for something and didnt really want to talk 
  where are you going    he chuckled when i turned around  i didnt answer  the airport hall was in the same state i had left it in  on the rise stood my deflated tray open to the light  i approached the racks of suits  but was suddenly put off by this escapade into the top armour  i turned around on the spot and made my way down the winding stairs to the storerooms  the narrow corridor was full of cylinders and crates stacked on top of each other  the walls here were bare metal  gleaming bluishly in the light  a few dozen more steps and the white frosted pipes of the cooling apparatus appeared under the ceiling  i followed them  they were penetrating through a thick plastic flange into a tightly closed room  when i opened the heavy  two hand thick door with its rubber edging  i was enveloped in bone penetrating frost  i trembled  ice icicles dangled from a thicket of snow covered coils  and here stood snow covered crates  bins  shelves against the walls were full of cans and yellowish lumps of some kind of fat wrapped in clear plastic  in the depths  the barrel shaped ceiling was lowering  a thick curtain hung there  sparkling with ice needles  i peeled back its edge  on a lair of aluminium bars rested a large  oblong shape covered in grey cloth  i lifted the edge of the sheet and looked into  s sinewy face  black hair with a grey strand above the forehead clung smoothly to the skull  the larynx stood high  breaking the neck  dry eyes stared vertically into the ceiling  a cloudy blob of ice gathered in the corner of the eyelid  the cold so pierced me that i struggled to hold back the gritting of my teeth  without letting go of the shroud  i touched his po count with my other hand  it was quite as if i had touched frozen wood  the skin was scraggly from the stubble that pierced it with black dots  an expression of immeasurable  contemptuous patience froze in the folding of my lips  lowering the edge of the cloth  i noticed that on the other side of the body several black  oblong beads or beans  from the smallest to the largest  were poking out from under the folds  at once i froze 
these were the toes of naked feet seen from the soles  the egg shaped bellies of the toes stood out slightly  beneath the crumpled edge of the shroud lay  flattened  a black bead 
she was resting on her face  as if plunged into a deep sleep  inch by inch i pulled back the thick material  the head  covered in hair  ruffled into small  bluish bundles  lay in the bend of an equally black  massive arm  the glistening skin of its back strained the hills of its spine  the colossal body was not animated by the slightest movement  i looked once more at the bare soles of her feet and was then struck by a strange thing  they were not flattened or compacted by the weight they had to support  they were not even calloused from walking barefoot  they were covered by skin as thin as that of the back or the hands 
i checked this impression with a touch that came far harder to me than touching a dead body  then an unbelievable thing happened  this body  exposed to twenty degrees of frost  was alive and moved  it pulled its foot up like a sleeping dog when you take it by the paw  its going to freeze here  i thought  but her body was calm and not too cold  i could still feel the soft touch unraveling in my fingertips  i retreated backwards behind the curtain  lowered it and returned to the corridor  it seemed to me to be incredibly hot inside  the stairs led me right out to the airport hall  i sat down on a rolled up breast thin parachute and took my head in my hands  i felt bruised  i didnt know what was happening to me  i was shattered  my thoughts were sliding down some cliff threatening to collapse   loss of consciousness  annihilation seemed an unspoken  unreachable grace 
i had no reason to go to   or sarto rius  i couldnt imagine that anyone could put together what i had experienced so far  what i had seen  what i had touched with my own hands  the only rescue   escape   explanation was a diagnosis of madness  yes  i must have gone mad  and immediately after landing  the ocean had affected my brain in this way   i was experiencing hallucination after hallucination  and since i was  there was no need to waste my strength in futile attempts to unravel puzzles that did not exist in reality  but to seek medical help  to call from the radio station prometheus or some other ship  to send sos signals 
then something happened that i would rather not have expected  the thought that i was crazy calmed me down 
i understood snau tas words all too well   if we assume that there was a   at all and that i ever spoke to him  after all  the hallucinations could have started much earlier   who knows if i wasnt still aboard the prometheus  stricken by a sudden attack of mental illness  and everything i experienced was a creation of my irritated brain  however  if i was ill  i could recover  and this gave me at least the hope of deliverance  which i was in no way able to discern in the tangled nightmares of a few hours of mere solarian experience 
it was therefore necessary  first of all  to carry out some logically conceived experiment on myself   experimentum cru cis   which would show me whether i had really gone mad and was a victim of the hallucinations of my own imagination  or whether  despite their absurdity and unlikelihood  my experiences were real 
i pondered this while gazing at the metal bracket that supported the airports support structure  it was a steel mast protruding from the wall  embanked with convex metal sheets  painted a celadon colour  in several places  at a height of about a metre  the varnish was peeling off  probably by the rocket trucks moving through it  i touched the steel  warmed it for a moment with my hand  knocked on the rolled up edge of the protective plate  could delirium reach such a degree of reality  maybe  i answered myself  after all  this was my field  i knew it 
and is it possible to invent this crucial experiment  at first i thought not  for my sick brain  if it really is sick  will produce whatever delusions i demand of it  after all  not only in illness  but also in the most normal dream  it happens that we talk to people we dont know on waking  that we ask these dream characters questions and hear their answers  at the same time   even though these people are in fact only foetuses of our own psyche  pseudo independent parts of it isolated in time  so to speak   we dont know what words will come from their mouths until they speak to us  in the dream   and yet they really are words crafted by that disembodied part of our own mind  and therefore we should already know them the moment we invented them ourselves  in order to put them into the mouth of a fictional character  whatever i had planned and realised  therefore  i could always tell myself that i had acted just as one acts in a dream  neither   nor   had to exist in reality  so posing any questions to them both was futile 
i thought i might take some sort of medicine  some potent agent such as peyote or some other preparation that induces hallucinations and colourful visions  experiencing such phenomena would prove that what i had taken really existed and was part of the material reality around me  but even this   i continued to think   would not have been a desirable key experiment  because i knew how the remedy  which i had to choose myself  should work  and therefore it could be that both the taking of this medicine and the effects caused by it would equally be creations of my imagination 
i was already thinking that  locked in a circle of madness  i would not be able to break out of it   after all  you cant think other than with your brain  you cant be outside yourself to check the normality of the processes going on in your body   when a thought suddenly dawned on me that was as simple as it was pertinent 
i sprang from the pile of rolled up parachutes and ran straight to the radio station  it was empty  in passing i glanced at the electric wall clock  it was approaching four oclock at night  the stations conventional night  for outside there was a red dawn  i quickly activated the long range radio communication apparatus  and while waiting for the lamps to heat up  i once again set down the various stages of the experiment in my mind 
i couldnt remember what the call sign of the automatic circumbinary sateloid station was  but i found it on a plaque hanging above the main console  i sent the call in morse code and after eight seconds a reply came  the sateloid  or rather its electron brain  reported with a rhythmically repeated signal 
i then demanded that it tell me which meridians of the galaxys stellar canopy it was crossing at twenty second intervals orbiting solaris  and to the fifth decimal place 
i then sat down and waited for an answer  it came after ten minutes  i tore off the paper tape with the printed result and  having hidden it in a drawer  and i was careful not to even glance at it   i fetched from the library large sky maps  logarithmic tables  an almanac of the satellites diurnal motion and a few ancillary books  then set about finding the answer to the same question  it took me almost an hour to work out the equations  i cant remember the last time i calculated like that  probably when i was still at university for an exam in practical astronomy  i did the calculations on the stations big calculator  my reasoning ran as follows  from the sky maps i should get figures that do not quite coincide with the data provided by the sateloid  not completely  because the sateloid is subject to very complicated perturbations under the influence of the gravitational forces of solaris  its two orbiting suns  as well as local variations in gravity caused by the ocean  once i have the two series of digits  provided by the sateloid and calculated theoretically based on the sky maps  i will make corrections to my calculations  then the two groups of results should coincide to the fourth decimal place  deviations will only remain in the fifth places  as being caused by the incalculable activity of the ocean 
even if the figures  provided by the sateloid  are not reality but the product of my deranged mind  they will still not be able to coincide with the second series of figures  for my brain may be sick  but it would not   under any circumstances   be able to carry out the calculus made by the stations great calculator  as this would require months of time  so   if the figures are correct   the great station calculator really exists and i used it in reality  not in delusion 
my hands trembled as i took the paper telegraph tape from the drawer and spread it out next to the other  wider one from the calculator  both series of digits agreed as i had predicted  up to the fourth place  deviations only appeared on the fifth  i hid all the papers in a drawer  so the calculator existed independently of me  this entailed the reality of the existence of the station and everything on it 
i was about to close the drawer when i noticed that it was filled with a whole bundle of sheets covered in impatient calculations  i pulled it out  a glance indicated that someone had already conducted an experiment similar to mine  except that instead of data relative to the stellar canopy  it requested sateloid measurements of the albedo of solaris at forty second intervals 
i was not mad  the last glimmer of hope was extinguished  i switched off the transmitter  drank the remaining bouillon from the thermos and went to bed
