after six days  the lack of any response prompted us to repeat the experiment  whereby the station  hitherto motionless at the junction of the forty third parallel with the one hundred and sixteenth meridian  sailed  maintaining a four hundred metre altitude above the ocean  in a southerly direction  where  as indicated by the sateloids radar sensors and radiograms  plasma activity revived considerably 
for two days  the x ray burst  modulated by my encephalogram  struck invisibly  at intervals of several hours  the almost completely smooth surface of the ocean 
by the end of the second day we were already so close to the pole that  as the almost complete disc of the blue sun hid behind the horizon  the purple puffing of clouds on its opposite steep heralded the rise of the red sun  the black vastness of the ocean and the empty sky above were then filled with a dazzling and violent battle of hard  metallic colours  glowing with venomous green   with muffled  deafening flames of crimson  and the ocean itself was pierced by the glare of two opposing discs  two violent fires  mercurial and scarlet  it took the slightest cloud at the zenith at that moment for the lights streaming with heavy foam down the slanting waves to be enriched with improbable rainbow flickers  shortly after blue sunset  a gigantic flower made of glass appeared on the north western horizon  heralded by signals  fused almost indistinguishably with the reddish fog and emerging from it only in single  mirrored swallows like a giant flower made of glass growing there  at the junction of sky and soil   a symmetry  the station did not change course  however  and after about a quarter of an hour  the colossus  vibrating red like a dimming ruby lamp  hid back behind the horizon  a few minutes later  a tall  thin pillar  whose base was already hidden from our eyes by the curvature of the planet  rose several kilometres  silently growing into the atmosphere  this obvious sign of the end of the perceived symmetry  half burning bloody  the other glowing like a pillar of mercury  grew into a two coloured tree  then the ends of its increasingly swelling branches merged into a single mushroom shaped cloud  the upper part of which set off in the fire of two suns on a distant journey with the wind  while the lower part  in heavy  clustered debris spread over a third of the horizon  descended remarkably slowly  after an hour  the last vestige of this spectacle disappeared 
again  two days passed  the experiment was repeated for the last time  the x ray punctures had already covered a not inconsiderable extent of the gleyed ocean  and to the south appeared  perfectly visible from our elevation  despite the three kilometre distance  the arrhenides  a post sixth  rocky chain of peaks as if frozen with snow  in fact raids of organic origin  proving that this formation had once been the bottom of the ocean 
we then changed our course to the south east and glided for some time parallel to the mountainous barrier  mixed with clouds  typical of a red day  until they too disappeared  ten days have now passed since the first experiment 
during all that time nothing actually happened on the station  once sartorius had worked out the programming of the experiment  it was then repeated by an automatic apparatus  and i am not even sure if anyone controlled its operation  but at the same time  there was a lot more going on at the station than one could wish for  not between people  i feared that sartorius would demand the resumption of work on the annihilator  and i waited for snauts reaction when he heard from that man that i had somehow deceived him by exaggerating the danger that annihilation of neutrino matter might entail  nothing of the sort happened  however  for reasons at first quite puzzling to me  of course  i also took into account some kind of trickery  a concealment on their part of the preparations and work  so every day i looked into the windowless room just below the floor of the main laboratory where the anihila tor was located  i never found anyone there  and the layer of dust covering the armour and cables of the apparatus was evidence that it had not even been touched for many weeks 
snaut  by this time  had become as invisible as sartorius  and even more elusive than him  because already even the visophone in the radio station was not responding to the call  the stations movements must have been directed by someone  but i cant say who  because i simply didnt care  however strange that may sound  the lack of response from the ocean also left me indifferent to the point that  after two or three days  i had little that i had stopped counting on it or fearing it  i had completely forgotten about it and the experience  i sat all day either in the library or in the cabin with harey loitering beside me like a shadow  i could see that it was bad with us and that this state of apathetic and mindless suspension could not drag on indefinitely  i should have broken it somehow  changed something in our relations  but the very thought of any change i pushed away  incapable of making any decision  i cant explain it any other way  but it seemed to me that everything on the station  and especially everything between harey and me  was in a state of extremely unstable  breakneck balance and a breach of it could turn everything into ruin  why  i dont know 
the strangest thing was that she also felt  to some extent at least  something similar  when i think about it now  it seems to me that this feeling of uncertainty  of suspension  of a moment before an impending earthquake  was brought about by an otherwise undetectable presence filling all the decks and rooms of the station  although there was perhaps another way of guessing it  dreams  as i have never had such visions before or since  i decided to write them down  and it is only to my credit that i am able to make out anything about them  but they are also only fragments  deprived of almost all their terrifying richness  in almost inexpressible circumstances  in spaces without sky  earth  floors  ceilings or walls  i stayed as if shrunken or trapped in a substance that was externally alien to me  as if my whole body were congealed into a half dead  motionless  formless lump  or rather  as if i were it  deprived of a body  surrounded by indistinct at first blurs of pale pink colour  suspended in a medium with different optical properties from the air  so that it was only at close range that things became clear  or even excessively and supernaturally clear  because in these dreams my immediate surroundings surpassed the concrete and material impressions of java  waking up  i had the paradoxical feeling that the awakening  the real awakening  was just that  and that what i was seeing when i opened my eyes was just some shrivelled shadow of it 
so that was the first image  the beginning  from which the dream was emerging  all around me something was waiting for my acquiescence  for my consent  for an inner nudge  and i knew  or rather something in me knew  that i should not succumb to an incomprehensible temptation  because the more   silently   it promises  the more terrible the end will be  but i didnt actually know that  because then i would have been afraid  and i never felt afraid  i waited  the first touch emerged from the pink mist that surrounded me  and i  inert as a block  was stuck somewhere deep in that which  as it were  was enclosing me  i could neither retreat nor move  and that which was exploring my prison with touches that were blind and seeing at the same time  and it was already like a hand that was creating me  up to that moment i had not even had sight  and here i saw   under the fingers wandering blindly over my face  my lips and cheeks were emerging from nothingness  and as this touch  spread out into infinitely small fractions  expanded  i already had a face and a breathing torso  brought into existence by this   symmetrical   act of creation  for i  too  created  created in turn  and a face i had never seen before  alien  familiar  appeared  i tried to look into its eyes  but i could not do so  for everything was still out of proportion  for there were no directions here  and only in a kind of prayed silence did we discover and become   each other  and i was already alive myself  but amplified as if without limit  and that being   woman    persisted with me in immobility  a pulse filled us and we were one  and then suddenly something unspeakably cruel  impossible and contrary to nature crept into the slowness of that scene  beyond which nothing existed and could not seem to exist  the same touch that had created us and clung to our bodies with an invisible golden cloak was beginning to tingle  our bodies  naked and white  began to flow  blackening into streams of writhing vermin that escaped us like air  and i was   we were   i was a shimmering  intertwining and unravelling  feverish mass of slithering motion  endless  infinite  and in that shorelessness   no    i  the shoreless one  howled  silently  for extinction  for an end  but at that very moment i was diverging in all directions at once  and i was rising  brighter than any other dream  diminished  focused in black and red distances  then solidifying into a rock  then culminating somewhere  in the glare of another sun or world  in suffering 
this was the simplest of dreams  the others i cannot recount  for the throbbing sources of horror in them no longer had any counterpart in the wakeful consciousness  i knew nothing of hareys existence in them  but neither could i find any memories or experiences of the day in them  there were other dreams in which  in the deadly clotted darkness  i felt myself to be the subject of some laboured  slow  unassisted sensory exploration  it was penetrating  fragmenting  losing itself until it was completely empty  the last floor  the bottom of these silent  annihilating crossings was fear  the mere reminder of which in the daytime quickened the heartbeat 
and days alike  as if faded  full of a dull aversion to everything  crept sluggishly along in extreme indifference  the nights only dreaded and i knew not how to save myself from them  i kept vigil together with harey not needing sleep at all  kissing and caressing her  but i knew that i meant neither her nor myself  that i was doing everything for fear of sleep  and she  though i had not said a word to her about these harrowing nightmares  must have guessed something  for i felt in her swoon the consciousness of perpetual humiliation  and i had no help for it  i said that we had not seen snaut or sartoriu s all the time  snaut did  however  let me know every few days  sometimes with a card  but more often with a telephone call  he asked if i had noticed some new phenomenon  some change  something that could be interpreted as a reaction  triggered by an experiment repeated so many times 
i replied that nothing  and asked the same question myself  snaut only denied it with a movement of his head  deep in the screen 
on the fifteenth day after the cessation of the experiments  i awoke earlier than usual  as weary from the nightmare as if i had opened my eyes from a numbness induced by a deep anaesthetic  through the uncovered window i saw  in the first glare of the red sun  whose giant extension was cutting the surface of the ocean with a river of purple fire  how this hitherto dead plane was blurring imperceptibly  its blackness turned pale at first  as if covered by a thin layer of fog  but this fog had a very material consistency  centres of anxiety arose in it in some places  until an indefinite movement engulfed the entire visible space  the blackness disappeared  shielded by membranes blurring it  pale pink in the bulges and pearl brown in the concavities  the colours  at first alternating  modelling this strange veil of the ocean into long rows of frozen waves  as if during a rocking motion  mixed  and already the whole ocean was covered with a thick  spongy foam  rising in huge sheets upwards  both under the station itself and around it  on all sides at once rose into the red  empty sky membranous piano clouds  spread horizontally  completely unlike clouds  with thickened balloon like edges  those which  in horizontal streaks  obscured the low sun disc  were  by contrast with its burning  black as coal  others  near the sun  depending on the angle at which they were struck by the rays of the east  rippled  lit up cherry red  amaranthine  and the process went on  as if the ocean were peeling away in blood coloured stratifications  this showing its black surface from beneath them  this shielding itself with a new coating of solidified foam  some of these creatures glided up close  just behind the glass panes  barely passing them by metres  and once a single one scraped against the glass with its silky surface  while the swarms that had first risen into the sky were barely visible in the depths of the sky like scattered birds and dissolved into the zenith with a transparent sediment 
the station stood still  frozen  and continued like this for about three hours  while the spectacle did not cease  at the end  when the sun slipped below the horizon and the ocean below us was enveloped in darkness  thousands of swarms of slender silhouettes  swept up  ascended into the sky higher and higher  flowing in endless ranks as if on invisible strings  motionless  weightless  and this majestic ascension  as if on ragged wings  continued until complete darkness enveloped them 
the whole phenomenon  shocking in its quiet vastness  terrified harey  but i could say nothing about it  to me  a so larist  it was as new and incomprehensible as to her  but forms and creations not yet recorded in any catalogues can be observed on solaris about two to three times a year  and with luck even more often 
the following night  around an hour before the expected blue sunrise  we witnessed another phenomenon   the ocean was phosphorescing  at first  on its surface  invisible in the gloom  single patches of light  rather dawn  whitish  smeared  appeared and moved according to the rhythm of the waves  they merged and spread until a spectral glow spread out towards all horizons  the intensity of the glow increased for about fifteen minutes  then the phenomenon ended in an astonishing manner  the ocean began to fade  a zone of darkness was moving from the west with a front perhaps hundreds of miles wide  and when it reached and passed the station  the part of the ocean which was still phosphorescent could be seen as a glow moving farther and farther to the east  high into the darkness  as it reached the very horizon  it became like a giant aurora borealis and immediately disappeared  when the sun soon rose  the empty  lifeless plane  barely marked by the wrinkles of the waves  sending mercurial sips into the windows of the station  spread out again in all directions  the phosphorescence of the ocean was a phenomenon already described  in a certain percentage of cases it had been observed before the outbreak of asymmetries  otherwise it was a rather typical sign of locally enhanced plasma activity  however  nothing happened outside or on the station during the next two weeks  only once  in the middle of the night  i heard  as if from nowhere and everywhere at once  a distant scream  unusually high  sharp and prolonged  actually a superhumanly amplified whimpering  snatched from the nightmare  i lay there for a long time  listening to it  not quite sure whether this scream was not a dream  too  the previous day  muffled noises had come from the laboratory above our cabin  as if great weights or apparatus were being moved  it seemed to me that the scream was also coming from above  by some incomprehensible means  since the two floors were separated by a soundproof ceiling  this agonising voice went on for almost half an hour  wet with sweat  half frantic  i already wanted to run upstairs  it was so nerve wracking  but eventually it quieted down and again only the shifting of weights could be heard  two days later  in the evening  as harey and i were sitting in the small kitchen  unexpectedly snaut walked in  he was in clothes  real  earthy clothes that transformed him  he was sort of taller and aged  without almost looking at us  he walked over to the table  leaned over it and  without sitting down  began to eat cold meat straight from the can  nibbling on bread  in the process he stuck his sleeve into the can  staining it with grease 
  youre greasing yourself  i said 
  hm   he just chuckled with his mouth full  he ate as if he hadnt had anything in his mouth for days  poured himself half a glass of wine  drank it in one gulp  wiped his mouth and  breathing  looked around with bloodshot eyes  he looked at me and muttered 
  have you grown a beard     well  well   
harey threw the dish into the sink with a noise  snaut began to rock slightly on his heels  crooked  and clinked loudly  cleaning his teeth with his tongue  it seemed to me that he was doing it deliberately 
  you dont want to shave  do you    he asked  staring at me insistently  i didnt speak up 
  watch out    he chuckled after a while    i advise you  he also stopped shaving first 
  go to sleep   i muttered 
  whats not stupid  why shouldnt we talk  listen  kelvin  and maybe he wishes us well  maybe he wants to make us happy  he just doesnt know how yet  hes reading our wishes from our brains  and only two per cent of neural processes are conscious  so he knows us better than we know ourselves  so we have to listen to him  agree with him  do you think  dont you want to  why   his voice broke down weepingly   why dont you shave 
  stop it   i burbled    youre drunk 
  what  drunk  me  why  cant a man who has carried his dung from one end of the galaxy to the other to find out how much hes worth get drunk  why  you believe in the message of man  hey  kelvin  gibarian told me about you before he grew a beard     you are exactly as he said    dont just go to the lab  youll lose faith yet     there sartorius is creating our faust au rebours  looking for a means against immortality  you know  hes the last knight of the holy contact  the kind we can afford     his previous idea was not bad either   prolonged agony  good  eh  agonia perpetua    straws    straw hats    how can you not drink  kelvin 
his eyes  almost invisible in the foggy eyelids  rested on harey  who stood motionless against the wall 
  oh  aphrodite white from the oceans birth  thrilled with divinity  thy hand   he began to declaim and choked with laughter    almost    exactly    what  kel    vin       he mouthed coughing 
i was still calm  but that calm was beginning to blunt into cold passion 
  stop it    i hissed    stop it and get out 
  are you throwing me out  you too  growing a beard and throwing me out  no longer do you want me to warn you  to advise you  like one righteous star comrade to another  kelvin  lets open the bottom hatches  well call out to him  down there  maybe hell hear  but whats his name  come to think of it  weve named all the stars and planets  and maybe they already had names  what a usurpation  listen  lets go down there  well shout    well tell him what hes made of us until hes horrified     he will build us silver symmetrics  and he will pray for us with his mathematics  and he will throw bloody angels at us  and his torment will be our torment  and his fear our fear  and he will beg us for an end  for all that he is and all that he does is a plea for the end  why arent you laughing  after all  i am only joking  it may be that if we as a race had more of a sense of humour  this wouldnt have happened  do you know what he wants to do  he wants to punish him  this ocean  he wants to make him scream all the mountains at once     do you think he wont have the guts to submit this plan for approval to this sclero typical areopagus that sent us here as redeemers of not his guilt  youre right  hell chicken out     but only because of the hat 
he wont betray his hat to anyone  hes not that brave  our faust    
i remained silent  snaut was tottering more and more on his feet  tears were trickling down his face and falling on his clothes 
  who did this  who made it out of us  gi barian  giese  einstein  plato  they were criminals   you know  come to think of it  in a rocket a man can burst like a bubble  or coagulate  or boil over  or burst into blood so fast that he doesnt even scream  and then just the cubes clatter on the plate  spinning in newtonian orbits with an einsteinian correction  these rattles of progress of ours  and we eagerly  for its a beautiful road  until weve arrived  and in these cells  over these plates  among the immortal dishwashers  with a horde of faithful wardrobes  clothespins devoted  here is our realisation     look  kelvin  if i wasnt drunk  i wouldnt be talking like this  but someone should finally say it  someone should finally  youre sitting here  you child in the slaughterhouse  and your hair is growing     whose fault is that  answer for yourself   
he slowly turned and walked out  on the threshold grabbing the door to keep from falling  we could still hear the echo of footsteps  coming back towards us from the corridor  i avoided hareys gaze  but our gazes came together suddenly  i wanted to walk up to her  embrace her  stroke her hair  but i couldnt  i couldnt
