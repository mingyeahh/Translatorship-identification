the next three weeks were like one and the same day over and over again  the window lids slid open and up  at night i crawled from one nightmare into another  in the morning we would get up and the game would begin  but was it a game  i pretended to be calm and harey pretended it  this tacit understanding  the knowledge of mutual deception  became our last escape  because we talked a lot about how we were going to live on earth  how we would settle down somewhere under a big city and never give up the blue sky and  green trees again  and we invented together the interior of our future house and garden  and we even argued over details about the hedge  about the bench     did i believe it for a second  no  i knew it was impossible  i knew it was  because even if it could leave the station   alive   only a man can land on earth  and a man is his papers  the first inspection would have ended that escape  they would have tried to identify her  so they would have disconnected us first and that would have given her away right away  the station was the only place we could live together  did harey know about this  she certainly did  did anyone tell her  in the light of everything that had happened   probably yes 
one night i heard harey get up quietly in her sleep  i wanted to take her in  already only silent  already only in the darkness  we could still become free for a moment  in a perdition which the despair surrounding us from everywhere made only a momentary suspension of torture  she didnt seem to notice that i had woken up  before i could reach out my hand  she was off the bed  i heard   still only half awake   the sound of barefoot footsteps  a vague fear seized me 
  harey    i whispered  i wanted to shout  but didnt dare  i sat down on the bed  the door leading into the corridor was all but closed  a thin needle of light slanted across the cabin 
i seemed to hear muffled voices  was she talking to someone  with whom  i jumped out of bed  but such monstrous fear gripped me that my legs refused to obey me  i stood for a moment listening   it was quiet  i slowly dragged myself back to bed  pulses rumbled in my head  i started counting  at a thousand i paused  the door slid open silently  harey slipped into the middle and stood still  as if listening to my breathing  i tried to make it steady    kris       she whispered softly  i did not speak  she slid quickly into bed  i felt her lying upright  and i lay beside her  numb  i dont know how long  i tried to form questions  but the more time passed  the more i understood that i would not speak first  after some time  maybe an hour  i fell asleep 
the morning was the same as always  i looked at her suspiciously only when she couldnt see it  after lunch  we sat side by side in front of a curved window with low  red clouds streaming past  the station glided among them like a ship  harey was reading a book of some sort  and i lingered in one of the stares that so often now became the only respite  i noticed that by tilting my head in a certain way i could see the reflection of us both in the glass  clear but distinct  i took my hand off the railing  harey   i could see it in the glass   having made sure with a quick glance that i was looking into the ocean  leaned over the railing and touched her lips to the spot i had just touched  i sat on  unnaturally stiff  and she leaned her head over the book 
  harey  i said quietly  where did you go out tonight 
  at night 
  yes 
  something    you were dreaming  kris  i wasnt going out anywhere 
  you werent going out 
  no  you must have been dreaming 
  it could be   i said    yes  its possible that i was dreaming    
in the evening  when we were already lying down  i started talking again about our journey  about returning to earth 
  ah  i dont want to hear about it   she said    dont talk  kris  after all  you know      what 
  nothing  nothing 
when we were already lying down  she said she was thirsty 
  theres a glass of juice over there on the table  pass it to me  please 
she drank half of it and handed it to me  i didnt feel like drinking 
  to my health   she smiled  i drank the juice  which seemed a little salty  but i didnt pay attention to it 
  if you dont want us to talk about the earth  then what    i asked when she turned out the light    would you have married if i hadnt been there 
  no 
  never 
  never 
  why 
  i dont know  i was alone for ten years and i didnt marry  lets not talk about it  darling    
i was groggy as if i had drunk at least a flask of wine 
  no  lets talk  lets just talk  what if i asked you 
  for me to marry you  nonsense  harey  i dont need anyone but you 
she leaned over me  i could feel her breath on my lips  she embraced me so tightly that the unstoppable drowsiness that was engulfing me retreated for a blink 
  say it another way 
  i love you 
she slapped her forehead against my shoulder  i felt the twitch of her tense eyelids and the wetness of her tears 
  harey  whats wrong with you 
  nothing  nothing  nothing    she repeated more and more quietly  i tried to open my eyes  but they were closing by themselves 
i dont know when i fell asleep 
a red dawn woke me up  my head was leaden and my neck stiff  as if all my vertebrae had fused into one bone  with my rough  nasty tongue i could not move my mouth  i must have poisoned myself with something  i thought  lifting my head with an effort  i reached my hand towards harey  it hit the cold sheet 
i pulled myself up 
the bed was empty  in the cabin   no one  red discs repeated the reflections of the sun disc in the windows  i jumped to the floor  i must have looked comical  because i staggered like a drunk  i grabbed onto appliances  caught up with the wardrobe   the bathroom was empty  the corridor too  and there was no one in the studio 
  harey      i shouted in the middle of the corridor  paddling unconsciously with my hands    harey      i yelled out again  already knowing 
i dont remember exactly what happened next  i must have been running  half naked  all over the station  i recall even running into the cold room and then into the last storeroom and banging my fists on the sliding doors  i may even have been in there a few times  the stairs rumbled  i tumbled  broke free  rushed somewhere again  until i reached the transparent barrier behind which is the exit to the outside  the double armoured doors  i pushed them with all my might and screamed for it to be a dream  and someone had been at my side for some time and was tugging at me  pulling me somewhere  then i was in a small workshop  with my shirt wet with icy water  my hair sticky  my nostrils and tongue baked with spirit  i was half lying panting  on something cold  metal  and snaut in his stained linen trousers was fussing with the medicine cabinet  knocking something over  tools and glassware making a terrible noise 
suddenly i saw him in front of me  looking into my eyes  attentive  hunched over    where is she 
  shes not there 
  but  but harey   
  there is no more harey  he said slowly  clearly  bringing his face close to mine  as if he had dealt me a blow 
and now he was watching its effect 
  hell be back      i whispered  closing my eyes  and for the first time i wasnt really afraid of that  i wasnt afraid of a spectral return  i didnt understand how i could ever fear it 
  drink this 
he handed me a glass of warm liquid  i looked at it and at once splashed the entire contents in his face  he stepped back  wiping his eyes  when he opened them  i was standing over him  he was so small 
  is that you 
  what are you talking about 
  dont lie  you know what  was it you who talked to her that night  and you told her to give her a sleeping agent for that     what did you do with her     speak up   
he searched on his chest  he took out a crumpled envelope  i snatched it from him  it was sealed  nothing on the top  i tore open the paper  a sheet of paper  folded in four  fell out of the middle  large  slightly childish writing in uneven rows  i recognised it 
 dear me  im the one who asked him first  he is good  terrible that i had to lie to you  there was no other way  you can do one thing for me   listen to him and dont do anything to yourself  you were great  
there was one crossed out word underneath  i managed to read it   harey  she wrote  then blurred it  there was another letter like h or k  turned into a blotch  i read it once and then again  and again  i was already too sober to be hysterical  i couldnt even moan  make a sound 
  how    i whispered    how 
  then  kelvin  hold on 
  im holding  tell me  how 
  annihilation 
  what do you mean  but the camera    it picked me up 
  roches apparatus was not suitable  sarto rius had built another  a special destabiliser  a small one  it only works within a few metres 
  what about her    
  she disappeared  a flash and a blast  a faint blast  nothing more 
  in a small radius  you say 
  yes  there were no materials for the big one  suddenly the walls began to lean on me  i closed my eyes    god    she    shell be back  shell be back after all   
  no 
  what do you mean no    
  no  kelvin  remember those rising foams  they havent come back since 
  not anymore 
  no 
  you killed her  i said quietly 
  yes  you wouldnt have done it  in my place 
i broke off and started walking faster and faster  from the wall to the corner and back again  nine steps  a turnaround  nine steps 
i stood in front of him 
  listen  were going to make a report  well request direct communication with the council  it can be done they will agree  they have to  the planet will be excluded from the convention of the four  all means permitted  we will bring in antimatter generators  do you think there is anything that can resist antimatter  there is nothing 
nothing  nothing    i shouted triumphantly  blind from tears 
  do you want to destroy it    he said    for what 
  get out  leave me 
  i wont go 
  snaut 
i looked into his eyes  no  he said with a movement of his head 
  what do you want  what do you want from me 
he backed away from the table 
  all right  well report back 
i turned around and started walking 
  sit down 
  give me a break 
  there are two things  the first is the facts  the second is our demands 
  shall we talk about it now 
  yes  now 
  i dont want to  do you understand  i dont care about anything 
  the last time we sowed a message was before gibarian died  its been upwards of two months 
we should be able to determine the exact course of the appearance of   
  you wont stop    i grabbed him by the arm 
  you can beat me  he said  but im still going to talk  i let him go 
  do what you want 
  the point is that sartorius will try to hide certain facts  im almost certain of that 
  arent you 
  no  not anymore  its not just about us  its about  you know  what its about  it has demonstrated rational action  a capacity for organic synthesis of the highest order that we dont know  it knows the structure  the microstructure  the metabolism of our bodies    
  good   i said    why did you stop talking  he performed a series on us    series    experiments  a mental vivisection  based on knowledge  stolen from our heads  with no regard for what we aspire to 
  they are no longer facts or even conclusions  kelvin  they are hypotheses  in a sense  they counted for what some closed  secretive part of our minds wanted  it could have been   gifts    
  gifts  great god  i started laughing 
  stop it   he shouted  grabbing my hand  i squeezed his fingers  i squeezed tighter and tighter until my knuckles crunched  he looked at me with squinted eyes  without a twitch  i let go of him and walked away to a corner  facing the wall  i said 
  ill try not to get hysterical 
  never mind all that  what shall we demand 
  you say  i cant now  did she say anything before    
  no  nothing  as far as im concerned  i think an opportunity has now arisen 
  chance  what chance  for what  aa      i said more quietly  looking into his eyes  as i understood suddenly    contact  contact again  were still small   and you  yourself  and the whole madhouse    
contact  no  no  no  without me 
  why    he asked quite calmly    kelvin  you still  and now more than ever  instinctively  treat him like a human being  you hate him 
  and you dont       i chuckled 
  no  kelvin  after all  he is blind    
  blind    i repeated  uncertain if i had heard correctly 
  of course  in our understanding  we do not exist for him as we do for each other  the surface of the face  of the body that we see  makes us known as individuals  it is a transparent pane of glass for him  he has  after all  penetrated inside our brains 
  so thats fine  but so what  what is your point  if he was able to animate  to create a human being that doesnt exist  outside of my memory  and in such a way that her eyes  her movements  her voice     voice   
  go on  go on  you hear   
  im talking    im saying    yes  so    voice    from that  it can read in us like a book 
do you know what im trying to say 
  yes  that if he wanted to  he could communicate with us 
  naturally  isnt that obvious 
  no  not at all  after all  he could only take a production prescription  which does not consist of words  as a fixed memory record  it is a protein structure  like the head of a sperm or an egg  there  after all  in the brain  there are no words  no feelings  a persons memory is an image  written down in the language of nucleic acids on large molecule asynchronous crystals  so he took what was apparently etched in us  the most closed  the most complete  the most deeply imprinted  you understand  but he didnt need to know at all what it was for us  what meaning it had  its as if we could create a symmetry and throw it into the ocean  knowing the architecture  the technology and the building materials  but not understanding what its for  what it serves  what it is for him    
  its possible  i said    yes  it is possible  in that case  he didnt     maybe he didnt want to trample us like that and squash us at all  it could be  and only inadvertently    my mouth started to fly 
  kelvin 
  yes  yes  all right  nothing anymore  youre good  so is he  theyre all good  but why  explain to me  why  what did he do it for  what did you tell her 
  the truth 
  the truth  the truth  what 
  you know  come to me now  were going to write the report  come on 
  wait  what do you actually want  youre not going to stay at the station    
 i want to stay  yes
