in the middle of the night i was awakened by a light  i raised myself up on my elbow  shielding my eyes with my other hand 
harey  wrapped in a sheet  was sitting at the foot of the bed  hunched over  her face streaked with hair  her shoulders were twitching  she was crying without uttering a voice 
  harey 
she scowled even more 
  whats the matter with you    harey   
i sat up on the bed  not quite awake yet  extricating myself slowly from the nightmare that had been choking me a moment before  the girl was trembling  i put my arms around her  she pushed me away with her elbow  she was hiding her face 
  honey 
  dont say that 
  but  harey  whats going on 
i saw her wet  tear streaked face  thick  childish tears were rolling down her cheeks  glistening in the pit above her chin  dripping onto the sheet 
  you dont want me 
  whats on your mind 
  i heard 
i felt my whole face stiffen 
  what did you hear  you didnt understand  it was just    
  no  no  you said it wasnt me  that i would go  i would have gone  god  id go  but i cant  i dont know what it is  i wanted to and i cant  im so  so wicked 
  baby   
i grabbed her  pressed her to me with all my strength  everything was falling apart  i kissed her hands  wet and salty fingers  repeated some incantations  oaths  apologised  said it was a stupid  awful dream  slowly she calmed down  she stopped crying  her eyes were huge  lunatic 
they had gone dry  she turned   her head away 
  no  she said  dont say that  you dont need to  you are not the same to me    
  i am not  it came out like a moan 
  yes  you dont want me  i felt it over and over again  i pretended not to see  i thought maybe i was imagining it or something  but no  youre acting    different  youre not taking me seriously  it was a dream  its true  but i was the one dreaming about you  you called me by my name  you were disgusted  why  why  i knelt down in front of her  put my arms around her knees 
  child   
  i dont want you to talk like that  i dont want to  do you hear  i am no child  i am   
she burst out sobbing and fell face down on the bed  i stood up  cool air was being drawn from the ventilation outlets with a quiet flurry  i was cold  i threw on my bathrobe  sat down on the bed and touched her shoulder 
  harey  listen  im going to tell you something  im going to tell you the truth   
she sat up  leaning slowly on her hands  i could see the pulses throbbing under the thin skin of her neck  my face was numb again and i felt so cold  as if i were standing in the cold  there was a complete blank in my head 
  the truth    she said    a sacred word 
i didnt answer immediately  i had to overcome a throat cramp  it was such an old spell of ours  when it was said  neither of us dared to not only lie anymore  but even keep silent about anything  there was a time when we tormented ourselves with excessive honesty  in the naive belief that it would save us 
  a holy word   i said seriously    harey    she waited 
  youve changed too  were all changing  but thats not what i wanted to say  it really looks like    that for a reason we both dont know exactly     you cant leave me  but its even a good thing  because i cant leave you either    
  kris 
i lifted her up  wrapped in a sheet  the horn  damp with tears  rested on my shoulder 
i walked around the room and swung her  she stroked my face 
  no  you havent changed  its me   she whispered in my ear    theres something about me  how about this  she stared at the black  empty rectangle left by the shattered door  the remains of which i had taken to the warehouse that evening  ill have to hang a new one   i thought  i sat her down on the bed 
  are you sleeping at all    i asked standing over her with my arms down 
  i dont know 
  how do you not know  think about it  darling 
  i dont think this is a real dream  maybe im sick  im lying like this and thinking  and you know     she trembled 
  what  i asked in a whisper  my voice could have failed me 
  these are very strange thoughts  i dont know where they come from for me 
  for example 
i have to be calm  i thought  no matter what i hear  and i prepared myself for her words like a strong blow 
she shook her head helplessly 
  its kind of     all around   
  i dont understand    
  as if its not just in me  but further  somehow  i cant tell  there are no words for it   
  im sure its a dream   i said casually and took a breath    and now well turn off the light and we wont have any worries until the morning  and in the morning  if we feel like it  well try to get new ones  okay 
she reached out for the switch  darkness fell  i lay back on the cooled bedding and felt the warmth of her approaching breath 
i embraced her 
  tighter  she whispered  and after a long moment    kris 
  what 
  i love you  i felt like screaming 
the morning was red  the puffy sun disc stood low over the horizon  a letter lay at the doorstep  i tore open the envelope  ha rey was in the bathroom  i could hear her humming  from time to time she looked out from there  doused in wet hair  i went to the window and read 
 kelvin  we are bogged down  sartorius is in favour of a vigorous course of action  he believes he will be able to destabilise neutrino systems  he needs a certain amount of plasma for his experiments  as the initial building block of f  he proposes that you go on reconnaissance and retrieve a certain amount of plasma for the tray  act on your own discretion  but let me know your decision  i have no opinion  i dont seem to have anything left at all  id prefer it if you did just because were going to move forward  however seemingly  otherwise all that is left is to envy g 
rat
ps  dont get on the radio station  that you can still do for me  the best thing you can do is make a phone call   my heart squeezed as i read this letter  i looked through it carefully again  tore it up and threw the shreds into the sink  then i started looking for a suit for harey  already it was awful  just like the previous time  but she didnt know anything  otherwise she couldnt have been so happy when i told her i had to go for a little reconnaissance outside the station and ask her to accompany me  we had breakfast in the small kitchen  with harey again barely swallowing a few bites  and went to the library 
i wanted to review the literature on field problems and neutrino systems before doing what sartorius wanted  i didnt yet know how i would go about it  but i decided to control his work  it occurred to me that some kind of neutrino annihilator that didnt yet exist could trigger snaut and sartorius  and i would wait out the operation along with harey somewhere outside   in an aeroplane  for example  i would dawdle for some time at a large electronic catalogue  asking him a question  to which he would either reply by throwing out a fiche with the laconic words none in the bibliography  or he would suggest i venture into such a jungle of specialised  physicalist papers that i didnt know what to make of it  somehow  i didnt want to leave this large  circular room with its smooth walls  swathed in drawers with a myriad of microfilms and electron records  located in the heart of the station  the library had no windows and was the best insulated place inside the steel shell  who knows if that wasnt why i was comfortable in it  despite the apparent failure of my search  i wandered around the great hall until i was confronted with a huge  ceiling length bookcase full of books  this was not so much a luxury  which was dubious to say the least  as an expression of remembrance and respect for the pioneers of solarian exploration  the shelves  numbering some six hundred volumes  carried the entire classics of the subject  starting with gieses monumental  if largely outdated  nine volume monograph  i took out these volumes  from the weight of which my hand immediately sagged  and leafed through them absentmindedly  perched on the armchair railing  harey  too  had found herself some book   over her shoulder i read a few lines of print  it was one of the few books belonging to the first expedition  perhaps even once owned by giese himself    the interplanetary cook     i said nothing  seeing with what attention harey was studying the recipes  adapted to the harsh conditions of cosmonautics  and returned to the respectable book i had in my lap  ten years of solaris research came out in the solariana series as items four to thirteen  while the present ones have four digit numbers 
giese did not have much flair  but this trait can only hurt a solaris researcher  nowhere perhaps does imagination and the ability to hastily create hypotheses become so fatal  after all  anything is possible on this planet  the unbelievable sounding descriptions of the constellations formed by the plasma are in all probability authentic  although generally unverifiable  for the ocean rarely repeats its evolutions  to the first time observer  they are frightening mainly because of their strangeness and enormity  if they occurred on a small scale  in a byre  they would probably be considered just another  freak of nature   a manifestation of randomness and blind play of forces  the fact that mediocrity and genius are equally helpless in the face of the infinite variety of solar forms does not make it any easier to deal with the phenomena of the living ocean either  giese was neither one nor the other  he was simply a classifier pedant  of the kind whose outward calmness shields the life consuming  tireless fervour of his work  for as long as he could  he simply used the language of description  and when he ran out of words  he coped by creating new words  often unfortunate ones  incompatible with the phenomena he was describing  but in the end  no terms can capture what is happening on solaris  his  montane trees   his  longwoods   his  mushrooms   his  mimoids   his  sime triads  and  asymmetriads   his  trowels  and his  khyz  sound insanely artificial  but they give some idea of solaris even to those who have seen nothing but blurry photographs and supremely imperfect films  of course  this conscientious classifier has also sinned by more than one carelessness  man always makes hypotheses  even when he is on guard  even when he does not know it  giese thought that the  longons  were a fundamental form  and juxtaposed it with the many times enlarged and piled up tidal waves of the earths seas  anyone who has dug around in the first edition of his work  by the way  knows that he originally just called them tides  inspired by a geocentrism that would be laughable if it were not for its helplessness  after all  these are   if we are already looking for comparisons on earth   formations  in size exceeding the grand canyon of colorado  modelled in a material that has a jelly water foam consistency on the surface  with this foam solidifying into giant  easily crumbling festoons  into lace with giant eyes  and even appeared to some researchers as  skeleton watt like growths     while at depth it changes into an increasingly firm substance  like a taut muscle  but a muscle which soon exceeds the hardness of a boulder at a depth of several metres  while still retaining elasticity  between the walls  taut as a membrane on a monsters back  to which the  skeletons  cling  stretches the  longon  itself over the course of kilometres  a seemingly autonomous creature  like some colossal python that has devoured whole mountains and now digests them in silence  from time to time setting its fish like compressed body into slow  twitching movements  but this is what the  longon  looks like only from above  from the deck of a flying machine  when one approaches it  until the two  gorge walls  rise hundreds of metres above the aircraft  the  pythons trunk  turns out to be an area of movement stretching to the horizon  so dizzying that it takes on the appearance of a passively swollen cylinder  the first impression is that of a swirling  slippery  greyish green slurry  which piles up to reject the strong flashes of the sun  but when the machine hovers just above the surface  and the edges of the gorge  concealing the longon  then become as if peaks on either side of a geological sinkhole   it becomes apparent that the movement is far more complicated  it has concentric circulations  darker streams intersect in it  at times the top mantle becomes a mirror like surface reflecting the sky and clouds  pierced with a roar of gunfire by eruptions of gas mixed  semi liquid medium  it slowly becomes clear that just below you is the centre of action of the forces that keep the sloping slopes of the sluggishly crystallising jelly spread out against the sky  but what is obvious to the eye is not so easily acknowledged by science  for how many years there have been fierce debates about what actually happens within the longons that plough the immensity of the living ocean by the millions  it was thought that these were some kind of monster organs  that metabolism  respiratory processes  nutrient transport  and only dusty libraries know what else took place within them  each hypothesis was eventually disproved by a thousand painstaking and sometimes dangerous experiments  and all this applies only to longons  essentially the simplest  most durable form  as their existence is counted for weeks   a thing quite unique here 
a more intricate  capricious and perhaps the most violently objectionable form   objectionable  of course  reflexively   are the  mimoids   it is no exaggeration to say that giese loved them and devoted himself to researching  describing and guessing at their essence  he used the name to express what is most peculiar to human beings in them  a certain tendency to imitate the forms around them  be they close or distant 
one day  deep beneath the surface of the ocean  a flat  wide circle with jagged edges and a tarry surface begins to darken  after a dozen hours or so  it becomes flaky  showing more and more clearly its dismemberment  and at the same time it breaks through upwards  towards the surface  an observer would swear that a fierce battle is taking place beneath it  as from all around it  like shrinking lips  like living  muscular  closing craters  endless rows of concurrent  circular waves  pile up over the blackish  wobbly maya  spilling into the depths  and  standing toe to toe  crash downwards  each such collapse of hundreds of thousands of tons is accompanied for seconds by a stretched  viscous  gurgling  one would like to say  thunder  because here everything is happening on a monstrous scale  the dark formation is pushed down  each successive blow seems to flatten and split it  from the individual lobes  which hang like soggy wings  separate into long clusters  narrow into long necklaces  melt into each other and flow upwards  carrying the mother shield  as if clinging to them  fossilised  and meanwhile  from above  successive rings of waves continually fall into the ever more visibly concave collar  and this game goes on  sometimes for a day  sometimes for a month  sometimes it all ends there  the conscientious giese called this variant the  abortive mimoid   as if  out of the blue  he possessed the precise knowledge that the ultimate goal of any such cataclysm is the  mature mimoid   i e  that colony of polypoid  i skinned growths  usually larger than an earthly city  whose destiny is to ape external shapes     of course  there was no shortage of another solar scientist  named uyvens  who regarded this final phase precisely as degenerative  as degeneration  death  and the forest of shapes being created as an obvious manifestation of the liberation of the de polyped creations from the authority of the matrix 
giese  however  who in all his descriptions of other solar formations behaves like an ant walking over a frozen waterfall  not allowing anything to interrupt the steady pace of his dry phrase  was so sure of himself that he arranged the individual phases of the mimoids emergence into a sequence of increasing perfection 
seen from on high  the mimoid appears to resemble a city  but this is a delusion induced by the search for any analogy in the midst of the familiar  when the sky is clear  all the multi storey outgrowths and their pinnacle palisades are surrounded by a layer of heated air  causing the apparent swaying and bending of shapes already difficult to determine  the first cloud gliding blue  i say that out of habit  as this blue is red for red  and frighteningly white during a blustery day  elicits an immediate response  it begins a violent budding  upward is thrown an almost completely separated from the ground  a malleable  puffy cauliflower like shell that simultaneously fades and  after a few minutes  deceptively imitates a billowing cloud  this giant object casts a reddish shadow  one mimic peaks give as if to the next  this movement is always in the opposite direction to that of the actual cloud  i think giese would probably give his hand to find out at least why this happens  but such solitary creations of the mimic are nothing compared to the spontaneous activity it manifests when irritated by the presence of objects and shapes that appear above it through earthly visitors  the reproduction of forms extends  indeed  to anything within eight to nine miles  most often  the mimoid produces an enlarged reproduction  sometimes distorting it to create caricatures or grotesque simplifications  especially of machines  obviously  the material is always the same  quickly fading mass  which  when thrown into the air  instead of falling down  hovers  connected by easily torn umbilical cords to the ground  over which it glides crawling  while at the same time shrinking  narrowing or inflating  smoothly forming itself into the most intricate patterns  an aeroplane  a truss or a mast are reproduced with the same vividness  mimoid does not react to humans alone or  strictly speaking  to any living creatures  including plants  because these too were brought to solaris for experimental purposes by tireless researchers  on the other hand  a mannequin  a human puppet  a statue of a dog or a tree sculpted from any material is copied immediately 
and here  unfortunately  it should be noted parenthetically that this obedience of the mimoid to the experimenters  so unique on solaris  is sometimes subject to suspension  the most mature mimoid experiences its  lazy days   during which it only pulsates very slowly  this pulsation  moreover  is not discernible to the eye  its rhythm  a single phase of its pulse  spans more than two hours  and it only took special film footage for it to be discovered  under such circumstances  the mimoid  especially the old one  is perfect for exploring  as both the supporting shield  submerged in the ocean  and the formations erected from it give all too sure footing 
of course  it is also possible to visit the mimosid during its  busy  days  but then visibility is close to zero  due to the constant dropping of the fluffy  whitish colloidal suspension  which continually falls from the swollen abdomen  copying the forms  these forms are  moreover  impossible to grasp at close range  due to their vastness on a mountainous scale  in addition  the substrate of the  working  mimic becomes soggy from the fleshy rain  which only turns into a hard shell  many times lighter than pumice stone  after several hours 
finally  without the appropriate equipment  it is easy to get lost in the labyrinth of bulging shells  resembling neither shrinking columns nor semi liquid geysers  even in bright sunlight  as its rays cannot pierce the cover of the  imitation explosions  continually thrown into the atmosphere 
observing the mimic in its happy days  these are  to be more precise  the happy days of the researcher above it  can be a source of indelible impressions  it has its creative highs when it embarks on an incredible hyperproduction  he then creates either his own variants of external forms  or their complications or even  formal continuations   and can entertain himself in this way for hours  to the delight of the abstract painter and the despair of the scientist who tries in vain to understand anything of the processes taking place  at times  the mimoids activity manifests the characteristics of a downright childish simplification  at other times it descends into a  baroque deviation   in which case everything it creates is marked by the stigma of a swollen elephants flesh  the old mimoids  in particular  fabricate shapes capable of provoking hearty laughter  admittedly  i have never been able to laugh at them  too shocked by the mysteriousness of the spectacle 
it goes without saying that in the first years of research  the mimoids were cast as the supposed dream centres of the solarian ocean  as places where the longed for contact between two civilisations would take place  all too soon  however  it became apparent that there was no contact at all  as everything began and ended with the imitation of shapes  which led nowhere  the anthropo  or zoomorphism  which was constantly recurring in the desperate search of researchers  saw in other and other products of the living ocean  sensory organs  or even  limbs   for which scholars  such as maartens and ekkonai  for a time took gieses  trowels  and  chyazas   but these protuberances of living ocene shooting sometimes up to two miles into the atmosphere are as much limbs as an earthquake is the gymnastics of its crust 
the catalogue of relatively constant recurring forms  birthed by the living ocean so frequently that at least a few dozen or a few hundred may be discovered on its surface in a day  includes some three hundred items  the most inhuman  in the sense of having absolutely no resemblance to anything experienced by man on earth  are  according to the giese school  the symmetries  when it was already well known that the ocean does not behave aggressively and that one can only perish in its plasmatic depths if one takes special care to do so due to ones own carelessness or thoughtlessness  i am not  of course  talking about accidents caused  for example  by damage to the oxygen apparatus or air conditioning unit   then it became clear that the ocean is not the only place in the world where the ocean is a threat  i am of course not talking about accidents caused by e g  damage to the oxygen apparatus or the air conditioning unit   that even cylindrical rivers of debt and monstrous columns of tetrapods  wobbling erroneously among the clouds  can be pierced through by aircraft or other flying machines without the slightest danger  the plasma gives a free path  parting before the alien body with a rapidity equal to the speed of sound in the solarian atmosphere  opening  if forced to do so  deep tunnels even under the surface of the ocean  while the energy  which it instantly sets in motion for this purpose  is enormous   scriabin calculated it at 1019 ergs in extreme cases      the study of symmetriads was approached with extreme caution with the constant retreating  multiplying safeguards  often admittedly fictitious  and the names of those who first ventured into their abysses are known to every child on earth 
the horror of these giants does not lie in their appearance  although it can indeed give one nightmarish dreams  rather  it comes from the fact that there is nothing constant or certain about them  even physical laws are suspended within them  it is the researchers of symmetries who have always most loudly repeated the thesis that the living ocean is rational 
symmetrics arise suddenly  their birth is a kind of eruption  about an hour beforehand  the ocean begins to shimmer violently  as if glazed over an area of tens of square kilometres  beyond that  its fluidity or the rhythm of its undulations does not change  occasionally  a symmetry erupts where there was a funnel from the sucked up chiseled  but this is not the rule  after an hour or so  the glazing shell flies upwards in a monstrous bubble in which the entire sky  the sun  the clouds  all the spectrums are reflected  shimmering and refracting  the lightning like play of colours  caused partly by deflection and partly by refraction  is unparalleled 
particularly violent light effects are produced by symmetries arising during a blue day and just before sunset  one then has the impression that a planet is giving birth to another  doubling in volume with every passing moment  the blazing globe  barely launched from the depths  splits into vertical sectors at the top  but this is not a break up  this stage  referred to unhappily as the flower cup phase  lasts for seconds  measuring into the sky  the arcs of membranous spans turn around  fuse in an invisible interior and begin to form  in an instant  something like a curvaceous torso  within which hundreds of phenomena take place
hundreds of phenomena at once  at the very centre  explored for the first time by hamaleis seventy strong team  the formation of an axial lifting arbor  sometimes called a spine  occurs by gi ganto  and polycrystallisation  but i am not a fan of this term  the breakneck architectonics of this central support is supported in statu
nascendi by gushing incessantly from kilometre long sinkholes vertical columns of such diluted  almost watery jelly  during this process  the colossus emits a deafening  prolonged roar  and is surrounded by a shaft of rapidly fluttering  snowy  thick bellied foam  this is followed  from the centre to the periphery  by extremely complex rotations of thickened planes  on which layers of stretchy material  beating from the depths  are built up  at the same time the geysers of the depths just mentioned are transformed  with a thickening  moving tentacle like columns  their bursts heading towards the constructions strictly defined dynamics  resembling some sort of sky scraping fetus growing with a thousand fold acceleration  through which streams of pink blood and water so dark green that its almost black flow  from this moment on  the symmetry already begins to manifest its most extraordinary property   that of modelling or even suspending certain physical laws  let us first say that no two symmetriads are the same and the geometry of each is  as it were  a new invention of the living ocean  further  the symmetry produces in its interior what are often called momentary machines  although these creations do not resemble human constructed machines at all  it is only a matter of a relatively narrow and thus as if mechanical purposefulness of action 
when the geysers bursting from the abyss bind or expand into thick walled galleries and corridors running in all directions  and the  membranes  form a system of intersecting planes  overhangs and ceilings  the symmetry justifies its name by the fact that for every shape of winding passages  passages and inclines in one pole there corresponds in detail to the layout at the opposite pole 
after some twenty to thirty minutes  the giant begins to sink slowly  sometimes having first inclined eight to twelve degrees in its vertical axis  there are larger and smaller symmetries  but even dwarfs rise after a dip to a good eight hundred metres above the horizon and are visible from a distance of several miles  the safest way to get inside is just after equilibrium has occurred  when the whole thing stops plunging into the living ocean  at the same time returning to the exact vertical  the most appropriate place to penetrate is just below the top  there  the relatively smooth polar  cap  is surrounded by an area punctured like a lump by the dull mouths of the inner chambers and ducts  this formation is   as a whole   a three dimensional development of some higher order equation 
as we know  any equation can be expressed in the figurative language of higher geometry and a solid equivalent can be constructed  the symmetry is   in this sense   some kind of relative of lobaczewskis cones and riemanns negative curves  but a very distant relative  due to its unimaginable complexity  it is a development of the whole mathematical system  covering several cubic miles  and this development is four dimensional  because the essential coefficients of the equations are also expressed in time  in changes occurring with its passage 
the simplest idea was  of course  that we have before us nothing more or less than a
a  mathematical machine  of the living ocean  a model created on its scale of calculations  needed by it for a purpose unknown to us  but this hypothesis of fermonts is no longer shared by anyone today  tempting it certainly was   but the notion that with such titanic eruptions  every particle of which is subjected to the endlessly complicating formulas of great analysis  the living ocean pondered questions of matter  of space  of being     could not be sustained  too many phenomena can be encountered in the depths of the giant that are incompatible with this essentially simple  childishly naive  as some want to say  picture 
there was no shortage of attempts to devise an accessible model of symmetry  to visualise it  the example of awe rian  who put it this way  became quite popular  let us imagine an ancient building from the times of babylonian splendour  let it be formed of a living  excitable and evolving substance  its architecture passes smoothly through a series of transitional phases  assuming before our eyes the forms of greek and romanesque construction  then the columns begin to slenderise like stalks  the vaulting loses its weight  becomes more elusive  sharpens  the arches pass into steep parabolas  and finally they collapse in a shooting pattern  the gothic thus created begins to mature and age  it flows into late forms  the hitherto austerity of steep ascent is replaced by eruptions of orgiastic exuberance  the baroque grows in front of our eyes  bearing the fruit of excess  if we continue this sequence  treating our ever changing creation as individual stages of a living existence  we will finally reach the architecture of the cosmodromic age  coming closer at the same time  perhaps  to an understanding of what a symmetry is 
but this comparison  however developed and enriched  indeed  there have been attempts to visualise it by means of special models and film   remains at best impotent  at worst an evasion  if not simply a lie  for the symmetry bears no resemblance to anything earthly    
man can grasp so few things at once  we see only what is happening in front of us  here and now  to visualise the simultaneous multiplicity of processes  however related  however complementary  is beyond his capacity  we experience this
even in the face of relatively simple phenomena  the fate of one man may mean a lot  the fate of several hundred is difficult to grasp  but the history of a thousand or a million means essentially nothing  the symmetry is a million  no  a billion raised to a power  an unimaginability itself  so what if  in the depths of an aisle that is a tenth of the kronecker space  we stand like ants attached to the folds of a breathing vault  and we see the rise of gigantic planes  opalescent grey in the light of our flares  their interpenetration  softness and infallible perfection of a solution  which is  after all  only a moment   because here everything flows   the content of this architecture is movement  concentrated and purposeful  we are observing a crumb of a process  the vibration of a single string in a symphonic orchestra of super giants  and little because we know   but only know  without comprehending   that simultaneously above and below us  in the soaring abysses  beyond the limits of sight and imagination  multitudes and millions of simultaneous transformations are taking place  linked to each other like notes by mathematical counterpoint  so someone called it a geometrical symphony  but in the face of this we are deaf listeners to it 
here  in order to see anything really  one would have to move away  to retreat into some vast distance  but after all  everything in the symmetry da is interior  multiplying  bursting with avalanches of birth  endlessly shaping  while shaping is at the same time shaping  and no mimosa is as sensitive to touch as the part of the symmetry da that is miles away from where we stand  separated by a hundred storeys  to the changes that this our place is experiencing  here each momentary construction  with a beauty that finds fulfilment beyond the limits of sight  is co constructor and conductor of all the others  sharing  and they in turn modelling influence  a symphony   fine  but one that creates itself and chokes itself  terrible is the end of symmetry  no one who saw it could resist the impression that they were witnessing a tragedy  if not a murder  after some two or three hours at the most   this explosive proliferation  duplication and self command never lasts longer   the living ocean proceeds to attack  this is what it looks like  the smooth surface wrinkles  the already calmed  foam dry shore begins to boil  concentric waves rush from the horizon  the same muscular craters as those assisting the birth of the mimic  but this time their size is incomparably greater  the undersea part of the symmetry is compressed  the colossus rises slowly upwards  as if it were about to be thrown beyond the planets perimeter  the surface layers of oceanic soil begin to activate  crawling higher and higher  onto the sidewalls  coating them  constricting them  bricking up the outlets  but all this is nothing compared to what is taking place simultaneously in the depths  first
form forming processes   the emergence of successive architectures from one another   freeze for a brief moment  then they accelerate rapidly  the movements hitherto  smooth penetrations  folds  the flailing of warps and vaults  hitherto steady and as sure as if they were to last for centuries  begin to rage  the feeling that the colossus  in the face of imminent danger  begins to strive rapidly towards some kind of fulfilment  becomes overwhelming  however  the more the speed of transformation increases  the more overt the awful  repulsive metamorphosis of the building itself and its dynamics becomes  all the shoots of wonderfully supple planes soften  flabby  sagging  stumbling  unfinished forms begin to appear  mangled  crippled  from the invisible depths there is a growing hum  a roar  the air  thrown out as if in some agonising breath  rubbing against the narrowing straits  snoring and playing thunderously in its flights  stimulates the collapsing ceilings to growl as if it were some monstrous larynxes  overgrown with stalactites of mucus  dead vocal cords  and the viewer is momentarily overwhelmed  despite the unleashing of the most violent movement   it is  after all  a movement of destruction   a complete deadness  only an orcano howling from the abyss  traversing it in thousands of shafts  supports  blowing  the sky building  which begins to flow downwards  collapsing  like a patch caught in the flames  but the last flutters are still visible here and there  inert  detached from the rest of the movement  blind  weaker and weaker  until  attacked relentlessly  from outside  the washed out immensity collapses with the slowness of a mountain and disappears in a profusion of foam  the same as that which accompanied its titanic rise  
and what does it all mean  yes  what does it mean   
i remember a school trip touring the solarian institute in aden when i was gibarians assistant  and after passing through a side room of the library  the youngsters were led into the main room  the lions share of which is filled with microfilm cassettes  on them are captured tiny fractions of the interior of symmetries  obviously long gone  and there are there  not photographs but whole reels  over ninety thousand of them  and then a fat girl  maybe fifteen years old  wearing glasses  with a resolute and understanding look  suddenly asked a question    whats all this for     and in the awkward silence that then ensued  only the teacher looked sternly at her unruly pupil  of the guided solarists  i was among them   no one came up with an answer  because symmetries are unique and the phenomena occurring in them are generally unique  sometimes the air stops conducting sound in them  sometimes the refractive index increases or decreases  locally there are pulsating  rhythmic changes in gravity  as if the symmetria da had a beating  gravitational heart 
at times the researchers gyrocompasses begin to behave as if deranged  layers of increased ionisation arise and disappear  a calculation that could be continued  anyway  if ever the mystery of symmetries is solved  asymmetries remain    
they arise in a similar way  only they have a different end and nothing can be seen in them but vibration  bludgeoning  flickering  we know only that they harbour dizzying processes  at the limits of physically possible speeds  they are also called  exaggerated quantum phenomena   their mathematical resemblance to certain models of the atom  however  is so unstable and ephemeral that some regard them as an incidental or even accidental feature  they live an incomparably shorter life than those  only a dozen minutes or so  and the end is perhaps even more awful  because in the wake of the hurricane  which fills and bursts them with hard  roaring air  a liquid rises in them with infernal viciousness  boiling under a blanket of filthy foam  and drowns everything  bubbling  hideous  followed by an explosion like the eruption of a mud volcano  throwing up a tarnished column of debris  whose macerated rain falls long afterwards on the restless surface of the ocean  some  wind blown  shrivelled  yellowish  flat and thus resembling membranous bones or cartilage of some kind  can be found drifting on the waves many tens of kilometres beyond the focus of the explosion 
a separate group is made up of formations that separate completely from the living ocean for a shorter or longer period of time  which are far rarer and more difficult to observe than those  their remains  first found  were identified most falsely  as it turned out much later  as the carcasses of creatures living in the depths of the ocean  at times they seem to flee like strange  many winged birds from the trumpets of the chyz  chasing them  but this notion  taken from earth  once again becomes a wall  which cannot be broken through  occasionally  but very rarely  on the rocky shores of the islands  one can see the odd flightless seal like shoals  as they rest in the sun or lazily crawl into the sea to melt into one with it 
and so they kept turning in a circle of earthly  human notions  and first contact     expeditions traversed hundreds of kilometres in the depths of the symmetriads  set up recording cameras  self made film cameras  the televised eyes of artificial satellites recorded the budding of mimoids and longons  their maturation and death  libraries were filling up  archives were growing  the price to pay for this  at times  was becoming high  seven hundred and eighteen people died in cataclysms  having failed to withdraw in time from already doomed colossi  one hundred and six of them in a single catastrophe  famous because it also claimed the life of giese himself  then an old man of seventy  when the end  usually inherent in asymmetries  unexpectedly befell a creature that was clearly an embodied symmetry  seventy nine people  together with their machines and apparatuses  clad in armoured suits  were swallowed up within seconds by an explosion of muddy slush  drawing down with their explosions a further twenty seven who were piloting the planes and helicopters circling above the creature under examination  the site  at the junction of the forty second parallel with the eighty ninth meridian  is marked on maps as the one hundred sixth eruption  but this point exists only on maps  for the surface of the ocean there is no different from all its other areas  at that time  for the first time in the history of solar research  voices were raised calling for the use of thermonuclear strokes  this was in fact to be crueler than revenge  it was to destroy that which we cannot comprehend  tsanken  the deputy of gieses reserve group  who only survived due to a mistake   the relay machine had falsely marked the place where those there were studying symmetry  so that tsanken wandered in his machine over the ocean and arrived literally minutes after the explosion  flying  he could still see its black mushroom   as the decision weighed in  he threatened to blow up the station with himself and the eighteen others in it  and although it was never officially admitted that this suicidal ultimatum influenced the outcome of the vote  it can be assumed that it did  
but the days when such populous expeditions haunted the planet are in the past  the station itself   its construction was overseen from satellites  an engineering endeavour on a scale of which earth might have been proud had it not been for the fact that the ocean emerged a million times larger in seconds   was formed in the form of a disc two hundred metres in diameter  with four storeys in the centre and two on the periphery  suspended five hundred to one thousand five hundred metres above the ocean  thanks to gravitators driven by the energy of ani hilation  it was equipped  in addition to all the devices possessed by ordinary stations and the great satelloids of other planets  with special radar sensors  ready to activate additional power at the first change in the oceanic slope  so that the steel disk floats off into the stratosphere when the first harbingers of the birth of a new life form appear 
now the station was virtually deserted  since the automatons had been locked   for reasons i still dont know   in the bottom storerooms  it was possible to roam the corridors without encountering anyone as if in a blindly drifting wreck whose machines had survived the annihilation of the crew 
as i put the ninth volume of gieses monograph on the shelf  it seemed to me that the steel  hidden under a layer of fluffy foam plastic  trembled under my feet  i became immobile  but the trembling did not recur  the library was perfectly insulated from the rest of the body  the tremor could only have one cause  some kind of rocket had taken off from the station  this thought brought me back to reality  i was still not quite decided whether i would fly  as sartorius had wished 
by acting as if i fully accepted his plans  i could at most postpone the crisis  i was almost certain there would be a clash  as i resolved to do what i could to save harey  the whole point was whether sartorius was likely to succeed  his advantage over me was immense   as a physicist  he knew the problem ten times better than i did and i could only  paradoxically  count on the perfection of the solutions the ocean was glaring at us with  over the next hour  i hunched over the microfilms  trying to pick out anything intelligible from the sea of infernal mathematics whose language was spoken by the physics of neutrino processes  at first it seemed hopeless  especially as there were five incredibly difficult theories of the neutrino field  a clear sign that none was perfect  and yet i finally managed to find something promising  i was just writing down the formulas for myself when a knock no sounded 
i walked quickly to the door and opened it  blocking the gap with my own body  snauts face  shining with sweat  appeared in it  the corridor behind him was empty 
  oh  its you  i said  swinging the door open    come in 
  yes  its me   he replied  his voice was hoarse  bags under his reddened eyes  he was wearing a shiny rubber radiation apron with elastic braces  the soiled legs of the same trousers he always walked in protruded from under the apron  his eyes swept around the circular  evenly lit room and became transfixed when he spotted harey standing in the depths next to the chair  we exchanged glancing glances  i closed my eyelids  then he bowed slightly and  falling into a companionable tone  i said 
  this is dr snaut  harey   snaut  this is      my wife 
  i am    a very low visibility member of the crew and therefore        the pause lengthened dangerously   i havent had the opportunity to meet       harey smiled and shook his hand  which he shook  it seemed to me  with some stupor  blinked his eyelids a few times and stood looking at her until i took him by the arm 
  im sorry  he said to her then    i wanted to speak to you  kelvin   
  of course  i replied with some big world casualness  it all sounded like cheesy comedy to me  but there was no advice    harey  darling  dont bother  we need to talk to the doctor about our boring stuff    
and i was already leading him by the elbow towards the small armchairs on the opposite side of the room  harey sat down in the armchair i had previously sat in  but she pushed it in the process in such a way that  lifting her head from above the book  she could see us 
  whats up    i asked quietly 
  i got divorced  he replied in the same  only more wheezing whisper  it is possible that i would have laughed if i had ever been told this story and such a conversation starter  but at the station my sense of humour was amputated    ive lived a few years since yesterday  kelvin  he added 
  a couple of good years  how about you 
  nothing      i replied after a while because i didnt know what to say  i liked him  but i felt that i had to be on my guard against him now  or rather against what he had come to me with    nothing    he repeated in the same tone as me    please  is that so    
  what do you mean    i pretended not to understand  he squinted his bloodshot eyes and  leaning over so that i could feel the warmth of his breath on my face  whispered 
  were getting bogged down  kelvin  i cant connect with sartorius anymore  i know as much as i wrote to you  what he told me after that little darling conference of ours    
  has he turned off the visophone    i asked 
  no  theres a short circuit in there with him  he seems to have done it deliberately or       he made a movement with his fist as if he was breaking something  i looked at him without saying a word  the left corner of his mouth lifted in an unpleasant smile 
  kelvin  i came because    he didnt finish 
  what are you going to do 
  you mean this letter       i replied slowly    i can do it  i dont see any reason to refuse  thats why im sitting here  i wanted to find out    
  no   he interrupted    not about that   
  no       i said pretending to be surprised    so im listening 
  sartorius   he muttered after a while    he seems to have found his way     you know 
he didnt take his eyes off me  i sat still  trying to put on an indifferent expression    first theres the x ray story  what gibarian did with it  you remember  some modification is possible   
  what kind of modification 
  they just sent a beam of radiation into the ocean and just modulated its intensity according to various patterns 
  yes  i know about that  nilin has done it before  and a whole bunch of others 
  yes  but they used soft radiation  this was hard  they were packing everything they had into the ocean  all the power 
  this could have unpleasant consequences  i noted    violation of the convention of the four and the un 
  kelvin    dont pretend  after all  it doesnt matter now  gibarian is dead 
  oh  sartorius wants to blame everything on him 
  i dont know  i havent spoken to him about it  it doesnt matter  sartorius thinks that since the visitor only ever appears when youre awake  he apparently pulls the production recipe out of us while were asleep  he thinks that our most important state   is sleep  thats why he acts that way  so sartorius  wants to send him our waking   waking thoughts   do you understand 
  in what way  by mail 
  you will frame the jokes separately  this burst of rays will be modulated by the brain currents of either of us 
at once my head brightened 
  aha   i said    that someone is me  what 
  yes  he was thinking of you 
  thanks a lot 
  what do you think of that 
i remained silent  saying nothing he looked slowly at harey sunk in reading and returned his eyes to my face  i could feel myself fading  i had no power over it 
  so how       he said  i shrugged my shoulders 
  i find these x ray sermons about the grandeur of man to be clownish  and so do you  maybe not 
  yes 
  yes 
  thats very good  he said and u smiled  as if i had granted his wish    so you are against this sartorius story 
i still didnt grasp how it had happened  but i could tell from the look in his eyes that he had led me where he wanted me to go  i remained silent  what could i say now 
  perfect   he said    because there is a second project  to rebuild roches apparatus 
  the annihilator    
  yes  sartorius has already done the preliminary calculations  its feasible  and it wont even require a lot of power  the apparatus will be active round the clock or indefinitely  producing an antifield 
  wait    wait  how do you imagine it 
  very simply  it will be a neu trin antifield  ordinary matter remains unchanged 
only the    neutrino systems  do you understand 
he smiled with satisfaction  i sat with my mouth half open  slowly he stopped smiling 
he looked at me investigatively  with a wrinkled forehead  and waited 
  the first draft of think is therefore rejected  what  the second  sartorius is already in on it  well call it freedom 
i closed my eyes for a moment  i suddenly made up my mind  snaut was not a physicist  sartorius had turned off or destroyed the visophone  very well 
  i would rather call it  slaughterhouse        i said slowly 
  you were a butcher yourself  maybe not  and now it will be something completely different  no guests  no f creations   nothing  already at the moment of materialisation   there will be disintegration    its a misunderstanding   i replied by shaking my head with a smile  i hoped it was natural enough    its not moral scruples  its self preservation instinct  i dont want to die  snaut 
  what    
he was surprised  he looked at me suspiciously  i pulled a crumpled piece of pattern paper out of my pocket 
  i thought about it too  are you surprised  after all  i was the one who first put forward the neutrino hypothesis  maybe not  look  antipoles can be induced  for ordinary matter  it is harmless  this is true  but at the moment of destabilisation  when the neutrino system collapses  the energy of its bonds is released as a surplus  assuming ten to eight ergs per kilogram of rest mass  we get for one creation f   five to seven times ten to eight  do you know what this means  the equivalent of a small uranium charge exploding inside a
station 
  what are you saying  but    but sartorius must have taken that into account    
  not necessarily  i denied with a mischievous smile    you see  the thing is that sartorius is of the frazer and cajolla school  according to them  all the energy of the bonds at the moment of decay is released in the form of light radiation  it would simply be a strong flash  not quite safe perhaps  but not destructive  however  there are other hypotheses  other theories of the neutrino field  according to cayatt  according to avalov  according to siona  the emission spectrum is much broader  with a maximum at hard gamma rays  its nice that sartorius believes his masters and their theories  but there are others  snaut  and you know what im going to tell you    i continued  seeing that my words had made an impression on him    the ocean must also be taken into account  if he did what he did  he certainly used the optimal method  in other words  his action seems to me to be an argument for the latter school   against sartorius 
  give me that piece of paper  kelvin     i handed it to him  he tilted his head  trying to read my scribbles 
  whats this    he pointed with his finger  i took the piece of paper from him 
  this  the field transmutation tensor 
  give it to me   
  what do you need it for    i asked  i knew what he would answer 
  i have to show sartorius 
  as you wish   i replied indifferently    i can give it to you  only you see  this is something no one has studied experimentally  we didnt know such systems yet  he believes in frazer  and i calculated according to siona  he will tell you that i am not a physicist and siona is not one either  at least in his understanding  but that is a matter for discussion  i do not wish a discussion in which i may evaporate to the greater glory of sartorius as a result  i can convince you  he cannot  and i will not try 
  so what do you want to do     hes working on it  snaut said in a colourless voice  he scowled  all his animation gone  i didnt know if he trusted me  but it was all the same to me now 
  its what the man theyre trying to kill does   i replied quietly 
  i will try to contact him  maybe hes thinking about some security measures  snaut muttered  he raised his eyes at me    listen  what if  after all     that first draft  what  sartorius would agree  for sure  its    in any case    some chance   
  do you believe it 
  no   he replied immediately    but    whats the harm 
i didnt want to agree too quickly  thats what i wanted  he was becoming my ally in the blame game 
  ill think about it   i said 
  well  ill go   he muttered  standing up  all his bones shook as he rose from his chair    so youre going to give yourself an encephalo game    he asked  rubbing the surface of his apron with his fingers as if he was trying to wipe off an invisible stain 
  fine  i said  paying no attention to harey  she was looking at the scene  silently  with a book in her lap   he walked to the door  when it closed behind him  i stood up  i unfolded the sheet of paper i held in my hand  the patterns were reliable  i had not falsified them  i just dont know if siona would have admitted to my unfolding  not likely  i twitched  harey came up from behind me and touched my shoulder 
  kris 
  what  darling 
  who was that 
  i told you  dr snaut 
  whos that man 
  i dont know him much  why do you ask 
  the way he looked at me   
  he must have liked you 
  no   she shook her head    it wasnt that kind of look  he looked at me like    like    she shuddered  raised her eyes to me and lowered them immediately 
 lets get somewhere
