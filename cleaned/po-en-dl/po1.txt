At nineteen oclock deck time I descended  passing those standing around the well  down the metal rungs to the inside of the bunker  There was just enough room in it to lift my elbows  When I screwed the end into the cable  protruding from the wall  the suit gave out and from then on I could no longer make the slightest movement  I was standing   or rather hanging   in an air bed  fused together with a metal shell 
Raising my eyes  I saw through the convex glass of the well wall and Moddards face bending above it  It disappeared immediately and darkness fell as a heavy protective cone was applied from above 
I heard the swish of electric motors tightening bolts eight times  Then   the hiss of air being let into the dampers  My eyesight was getting used to the darkness  I could already see the celadon outline of the only indicator 
  Ready  Kelvin    sounded in the headphones 
  Ready  Moddard   I replied    Dont worry about anything  The station will pick you up  he said    Have a good journey 
Before I had time to reply  something rasped upwards and the tray vibrated  I tensed my muscles reflexively  but nothing more happened 
  When do we take off    I asked and heard a rustle  as if grains of the finest sand were falling on the membrane 
  Youre flying now  Kelvin  Be well    replied the close voice of Moddard  Before I could believe it  a wide gap opened in front of my face  through which I saw the stars  I tried in vain to find the alpha of Aquarius  towards which Prometheus had flown away  The skies of these sides of the Galaxy told me nothing  I did not know a single constellation  there was a sparkling dust in the narrow window  I waited to see when the first star would ripple  I didnt see it  They only began to fade and disappear  dissolving into the russet background  I realised I was already in the top layers of the atmosphere  Stiff  wrapped in pneumatic cushions  I could only look ahead  There was still no horizon  I flew and flew and flew  not feeling it at all  just slowly  insidiously  my body swamped with heat  Outside  a quiet  penetrating glow woke up as if of metal on wet glass  Had it not been for the digits  popping up in the pointer hole  I would not have realised the suddenness of the fall  The stars were gone 
The viewfinder was filled with an ore like brightness  I could hear the heavy gait of my own pulse  my face was burning  I could feel the cold breeze of the air conditioner on the back of my neck  I regretted not being able to y see Prometheus   he must have been out of sight by now   when the automatic device opened the viewfinder 
The feed hopper quivered once and a second time  vibrated unbearably  the tremor passed through all the insulating shells  through the air cushions and invaded deep into my body   the celadon outline of the indicator blurred  I looked at it without fear  I had not flown from so far away to die at my destination 
  Solaris Station   I said    Solaris station  Solaris station  Do something  I seem to be losing stability  Station Solaris  this is the newcomer  Over 
And again I missed the important moment of the planets appearance  It spread out huge  flat  I could tell from the size of the streaks on its surface that I was still far away  Or rather   high up  because I had already passed that intangible boundary where distance from a celestial body becomes height  I was falling  I was still falling  I felt it now  even closing my eyes  I opened them immediately because I wanted to see as much as possible  I waited a few tens of seconds of silence and renewed the calls  And this time I received no answer  The crackling of atmospheric discharges repeated in salvos in the headphones  Their background noise was as deep and low as if it were the voice of the planet itself  The orange sky in the viewfinder went white  Its glass darkened  I reflexively shrank back as far as the pneumatic bandages would allow before  the next second  I realised it was clouds  As if blown away  a shoal of them flew upwards  I glided on  once in the sun  once in the shade  the tray rotated along its vertical axis and a huge  as if swollen  solar disc steadily sailed in front of my face  appearing on the left and overlapping on the right  Suddenly  through the hum and crackle straight into my ear  a distant voice began to chatter 
  Solaris Station to newcomer  Solaris Station to newcomer  All right  Arrival under Station control  Solaris Station to newcomer  prepare to land at time zero  repeat  prepare to land at time zero  attention  commencing  Two hundred and fifty  two hundred and forty nine  two hundred and forty eight     The individual words were punctuated by fractional meows  indicating that no human was speaking  It was strange  to say the least  Normally  whoever is alive runs to the airport when someone new arrives  and on top of that  straight from Earth  I couldnt ponder this any longer  however  because the huge circle the sun was making around me came to a standstill together with the plain towards which I was flying  this tilt was followed by another  in the opposite direction  I swayed like the weight of a giant pendulum and  fighting the dizziness  I saw on the rising wall like sky of the planet  streaked with dirty lilac and blackish streaks  a tiny chessboard of white and green dots   the Stations orientation sign  At the same time  with a clatter  something detached itself from the top of the tray   the long necklace of the ring parachute  which rippled violently  there was something indescribably earthy about the sound   the first  after so many months  hum of real wind  Everything began to happen very quickly  Until then  all I knew was that I was falling  Now I saw it  The white green chequered pattern was growing rapidly  and I could already see that it was painted on an elongated  whale like  silvery shiny body  with needles of radar sensors protruding from its sides  with rows of darker window openings  that this metallic colossus was not resting on the surface of the planet  but hanging above it  trailing its shadow across the ink black background  an elliptical patch of darkness even deeper  At the same time I caught sight of the oceans purple furrows  which revealed a faint movement  at once the clouds moved away high up  encompassed in a blinding scarlet at the edges  the sky between them stood distant and flat  buro orange  and everything blurred  I fell into a corkscrew  Before I had time to speak  a brief thump returned the tray to its upright position  the mercurial light in the viewfinder lit up the wavy ocean to the smoky horizon  the growling ropes and rings of the parachute unhooked suddenly and flew over the waves  carried by the wind  and the tray swung softly  with that special  slow motion as usual in an artificial force field  and slipped down  The last thing I managed to see were the latticed aerial catapults and the two  rising probably several stories high  mirrors of the openwork radio telescopes  Something immobilised the tray with the shrill sound of steel striking spring against steel  something unbuckled beneath me and  with a protracted  wheezing sigh  the metal hulk in which I was stuck upright completed its hundred and eighty kilometre journey 
  Solaris station  Zero and Zero  Landing complete  End   I heard the dead voice of the control device  With both hands  I felt an indistinct pressure on my chest and my insides became palpable as an unpleasant weight  I gripped the handles opposite my shoulders and disconnected the contacts  The green EARTH sign lit up and the tray wall opened  the pneumatic bed pushed me slightly in the back so that I had to  in order not to fall  take a step forward 
With a quiet hiss  similar to a resigned sigh  the air left the coils of the suit  I was free 
I stood beneath an aisle high  silvery funnel  Bursts of coloured pipes descended the walls  disappearing into circular wells  I turned around  The ventilation shafts rumbled  drawing in the remnants of the poisonous planetary atmosphere that had invaded here during the landing  Empty as a cracked cocoon  the trays cigar stood on a recessed steel canopy  Its outer plates were smoked a dirty brown  I climbed down a small ramp  Further down  a layer of rough plastic had been welded onto the metal  It had rubbed down to bare steel in places along which the usual trolley rocket lifters rolled  Suddenly the fan compressors went silent and there was complete silence  I looked around a little helplessly  expecting some person to appear  but still no one was coming  Only a neon arrow showed  blazing  a conveyor belt gliding silently by  I stepped onto its plane  The ceiling of the hall flowed down in a beautiful parabolic line  passing into the tube of the corridor  In its recesses rose piles of compressed gas cylinders  containers  ring parachutes  crates  all piled up in disarray  just the way they were  This also puzzled me  The conveyor ended at the circular extension of the corridor  Even more disorder reigned here  A puddle of oily liquid oozed under the pile of tin bubbles  An unpleasant  strong odour filled the air  In various directions were the footprints of shoes  clearly imprinted in this viscous liquid  Coils of white telegraph tapes  ragged papers and rubbish were crumbling between the tin  as if swept away from the cabins  And the green indicator glowed again  directing me towards the middle door  Behind them ran a corridor so narrow that two people would barely pass each other in it  Lighting was provided by the upper windows  pointed at the sky  with lenticular glass  Another door  painted in a white green chequered pattern  It was ajar  I stepped inside  The half spherical cabin had one large  panoramic window  the mist laden sky blazed in it  Down below  blackened hills of waves moved noiselessly  The walls were full of open cupboards  They were filled with instruments  books  glasses with dried up sediment  dusty thermoses  On the dirty floor stood five or six mechanical  rolling tables  between them a few armchairs  flabby because the air had been let out of them  Only one was bloated  with the backrest tilted back  In it sat a small  gaunt man with a sunburned face  His skin was flaking off his nose and cheekbones  I knew him  He was Snaut  Gibarians deputy cyberneticist  In his time he had posted some not at all original articles in the solar almanac  I had never seen him before  He was wearing a mesh shirt  through the meshes of which a single grey hair of his flat chest poked out  and once white  knee length  reagent burned canvas trousers with numerous pockets like an assemblers  In his hand he held a plastic pear  the kind you drink from on ships without artificial gravity 
He looked at me as if struck by a blinding light  The pear fell out of his relaxed fingers and popped a few times like a balloon  A little transparent fluid spilled out of it  Slowly all the blood drained from his face  I was too surprised to speak  and the silent scene continued until his fear granted me in some incomprehensible way  I took a step 
He shrank back in his chair 
  Snaut      I whispered  He twitched  as if struck  Staring at me with indescribable disgust  he whispered out 
  I dont know you  I dont know you  what do you want    
The spilled liquid evaporated quickly  I smelled the scent of alcohol  Had he been drinking  Was he drunk  But why was he so afraid  I stood still in the middle of the cabin  My knees were soft and my ears felt like they were plugged with cotton wool  I took the pressure of the floor beneath my feet as something not yet entirely certain  Behind the curved glass of the window the ocean moved steadily  Snaut did not take his bloodshot eyes off me  The fear was receding from his face  but the unspeakable disgust was still there 
  What is wrong with you       I asked in a low voice    Are you ill 
  You are caring      he said deafeningly    Aha  Youre going to care  arent you  But why about me 
I dont know you 
  Where is Gibarian    I asked  For a second he lost his breath  his eyes became glassy again  something ignited in them and went out 
  Gi    giba      he howled   no    no    He shook himself from a soundless  idiotic giggle  which was suddenly silenced 
  Have you come to Gibarian       he said almost calmly    To Gibarian  What do you want to do with him 
He looked at me as if I had ceased at once to be a threat to him  there was something hatefully abusive in his words  and even more so in their tone 
  What are you saying      I burst out stunned    Where is he  He was stunned 
  Dont you know    
Hes drunk  I thought  Drunk to the point of unconsciousness  I was becoming increasingly angry  I should have actually left  but my patience had run out 
  Wake up    I roared    How can I know where he is if I arrived just now 
Whats the matter with you  Snaut   
His jaw dropped  He lost his breath again for a moment  but somehow differently  a sudden gleam appeared in his eyes  With shaking hands he grasped the armchair railing and stood up with difficulty until his joints shook 
  What  he said almost soberly    Have you flown in  Where did you come from 
  From Earth  I replied furiously    Have you heard of it  It looks like you havent 
  From the     big sky    are you   Kelvin  
  Yes  What are you looking at like that for  Whats so strange about it 
  Nothing  he said  blinking his eyelids rapidly    Nothing  He rubbed his forehead 
  Kelvin  sorry  its nothing  you know  just a surprise  I wasnt expecting it 
  What do you mean you didnt expect it  After all  you got the message months ago  and Mod dard telegraphed even today  from aboard the Pro meteus    
  Yes  Yes    probably  only you see  theres a certain       disorder 
  Yes   I replied dryly    Its hard not to see it 
Snaut walked around me  as if inspecting the appearance of my suit   the most ordinary one in the world  with a harness of wires and cables on its chest  He coughed several times  He touched his bony nose    Would you like to take a bath     Itll do you good   the blue door  on the opposite   side 
  Thank you  I know the layout of the Station 
  Maybe youre hungry    
  No  Wheres Gibarian 
He came to the window  as if he hadnt heard my question  Turned by the cookers  he looked much older  His short shorn hair was grey  his neck  sunburned  was marked by wrinkles as deep as cuts  Outside the window shone the great crests of the waves  rising and falling as slowly as if the ocean were solidifying  Looking out there  one had the impression that the Station was moving slightly sideways  as if slipping from an invisible base  Then it would return to equilibrium and go the same lazy tilt in the other direction  But this was probably an illusion  Patches of blood coloured slimy foam gathered in the basins between the waves  For a blink I felt a faint pressure in my pits  The dry order of Prometheus decks seemed to me something precious  irretrievably lost 
  Listen      spoke up unexpectedly from Snaut   for the moment it was just me       He turned away  He rubbed his hands together nervously    Youll have to be content with my company  For the time being  Call me Rat  You only know me from photographs  but thats nothing  thats what everyone says  Im afraid theres no help for that  And when you have parents with cosmic aspirations like me  its only when youre a Rat that you start to sound like one   
  Where is Gibarian    I asked stubbornly again  He blinked 
  Im sorry to take you on like that  Its    its not just my fault  I completely forgot  there was a lot going on here  you know    
  Ah  thats all right   I replied    Lets leave it at that  So what about Gibarian  Hes not on the Station 
Has he gone somewhere 
  No   he replied  He looked at the corner cluttered with spools of cable    He hasnt flown anywhere  And he wont fly  Because of this    among other things   
  What   I asked  My ears were still plugged and I seemed to hear worse    What is the meaning of this  Where is he 
  After all  you already know   he said in a completely different tone  He looked into my eyes coldly  until shivers ran through me  He may have been drunk  but he knew what he was saying 
  Didnt it happen    
  It happened 
  An accident 
He nodded his head  He not only nodded  he approved of my reaction at the same time    When 
  Today at dawn 
Strangely enough  I felt no shock  Rather  the whole brief exchange of monosyllabic questions and answers reassured me with its matter of factness  I seemed to grasp already his previously incomprehensible behaviour 
  In what way 
  Change your clothes  put your things in order and come back here     in    say  in an hour  I hesitated a moment 
  Good 
  Wait   he said as I turned towards the door  He was looking at me in a peculiar way 
I could see that what he wanted to say was not passing his lips 
  There were three of us and now  with you  there are three again  Do you know Sartorius 
  Like you  from a photograph 
  Hes in the lab upstairs  and I dont suppose hell be out of there before nightfall  but     youll recognise him in any case  If you saw someone else  you understand  not me or Sartorius  you understand  then    
  Then what 
I didnt know if I was dreaming  Against the backdrop of the black waves  shining bloodily in the low sun  he sat in an armchair with his head lowered as before and looked sideways at the spools of coiled
cable 
  This    dont do anything 
  Who can I see  A ghost    I exploded 
  I understand  You think Im crazy  No  Im not crazy  I cant tell you otherwise     for now  Anyway  maybe    nothing will happen  In any case  remember  I warned you 
  Warned about what  What are you talking about 
  Control yourself   he said stubbornly    Act as if    be prepared for anything  Its impossible  I know  Nevertheless  try  Its the only advice  I dont know any other 
  But C O I will see      I shouted almost  I barely restrained myself from snatching him by the shoulders and giving him a decent shake as he sat there like that  staring into the corner  with a tormented  sunburnt face  and with a visible effort  he forced out single words 
  I dont know  In a way its up to you 
  Hallucinations 
  No  Its   its real  Dont    attack  Remember 
  What are you saying    I spoke in a not your voice 
  We are not on Earth 
  Polytheria  But they dont resemble humans at all    I exclaimed  I didnt know what to do to shake him out of this stupor  from which he seemed to read a chilling senselessness 
  Thats why its so scary  he said quietly    Remember  be on your guard 
  What happened to Gibarian  He didnt answer 
  What is Sartorius doing 
  Come back in an hour 
I turned around and left  Opening the door  I looked at him again  He was sitting with his face in his hands  small  shrunken  in stained trousers  I noticed only now that there was baked blood on the knuckles of both hands
