The next day  returning from lunch  I found a note from Snaut on the table under the window  It reported that Sartorius had refrained from working on the annihilator for the time being  in order to carry out as a last test the illumination of the ocean with a burst of hard rays 
  Darling  I said  I must go to Snaut 
The red east was bitter in the panes and divided the room in two  We were in a bluish shadow  Beyond its boundary  everything seemed like copper  you would have thought that any book  falling from a shelf  would have made a rippling sound 
  Its all about the experiment  I just dont know how to do it  I would prefer  you understand      I broke off 
  Dont explain yourself  Kris  I would so like to    If it wouldnt take long 
  It has to take a while  I said    Look  what if you came with me and waited in the corridor 
  Fine  But  if I cant stand it 
  Whats it actually like    I asked and added quickly    Im not asking out of curiosity  you understand  but  perhaps  having figured it out  you could control it yourself 
  It is fear  she said  She went a little pale    I cant even say what Im afraid of  because Im not actually afraid  Im just  Im just losing myself  At the last moment I still feel such  such shame  I dont know how to tell you  And then nothing  Thats why I thought it was some kind of illness       she finished more quietly and shuddered 
  It could be that its only like that here on this cursed Station  I said    As far as Im concerned  Ill do my best to leave it as soon as possible 
  Do you think thats possible    she opened her eyes 
  Why not  After all  Im not chained here     Besides  it will also depend on what I agree with Snaut  How long do you think you can be alone 
  It depends      she said slowly  She lowered her head    If I can hear your voice  I think I can manage 
  Id rather you didnt hear what we were saying  Not that I have anything to hide from you  but I dont know  I cant know what Snaut will say 
  Dont finish  I understand  Good  Ill stand so that I can only hear the sound of your voice  Thats enough for me 
  Ill call him from the studio now  Ill leave the door open    She nodded  I went out through a wall of red sunlight into the corridor  due to the contrast almost black despite the artificial lighting  The door of the small workshop stood open  The mirrored remains of a Dewar thermos lying on the floor beneath a row of large reservoirs of liquid oxygen were the last vestige of the nights accidents  The small screen glowed as I took off the handset and dialled the radio station  The bluish film of light  coating the frosted glass as if from within  cracked and Snaut  sideways leaning over the railing of the high chair  looked me straight in the eye 
  Hello  he said 
  I read the card  I would like to speak to you  Can I come 
  You can  Right away 
  Yes 
  Please  Are you    in company 
  No 
His tan brown  lean face  with thick transverse wrinkles on his forehead  in the convex glass tilted obliquely  as if he were a strange fish living in the aquarium from which he was peering out through the glass  took on an ambiguous expression 
  Well  well  he said    So Im waiting 
  We can go  darling  I began with not quite natural liveliness  entering the cabin through red streaks of light  behind which I could see only Hareys faint silhouette  My voice failed me  she sat slumped in her chair  interlacing her elbows under the railing 
Whether she heard my footsteps too late  or whether she couldnt relax that shrill spasm fast enough to assume a normal pose  enough that I saw her for a second  struggling 7  with that incomprehensible force within her  and my heart was choked with blind  frantic anger mixed with pity  We walked silently down a long corridor  passing sections of it  covered in variously coloured enamel  which was intended   by the architects   to add variety to the stay in the armoured shell  Already from a distance I saw the door of the radio station ajar  A long streak of red was falling from them into the corridor  as the sun was also reaching here  I looked at Harey  who did not even try to smile  I could see her all the way  focused  preparing to fight herself  The approaching effort had already changed her face  which had gone pale and seemed to have diminished  A few steps from the door she stopped  I turned to her  with my very fingertips she pushed me lightly to go  and at once my plans  the Snaut  the experiment  the whole Station  everything seemed nothing to me in the face of the ordeal she had come here to face  I felt like a torturer and was already about to turn back when a broad sunny streak  refracted on the corridor wall  was obscured by a human shadow  Accelerating my stride  I entered the cabin  The snaut was just beyond the threshold  as if heading to meet me  The red sun stood in a straight line behind him and a purple dawn seemed to radiate from his grey hair  We stared at each other for a good moment  saying nothing  He was studying my face  as it were  His expression I could not see  blinded by the glare of the window  I walked around him and stood next to the tall lectern from which the flexible stalks of microphones protruded  He turned slowly on the spot  following me calmly with that slight curve of his lips  which actually almost without changing became once a smile and once a grimace of fatigue  Without taking his eyes off me  he walked over to a whole walled metal cupboard in front of which piles of spare radio parts  thermal batteries and tools were piled up on both sides as if in a hurry  he pulled a chair there and sat down  leaning his back against the enamel door 
The silence we had maintained so far was already becoming strange  to say the least  I listened in  concentrating my attention on the silence filling the corridor where Harey had been left  but not the faintest murmur came from there 
  When will you be ready    I asked 
  We could even start today  but the recording will still take some time    Recording  You mean the encephalogram 
  Yes  you agreed  Why    He suspended his voice 
  No  nothing 
  Im listening to you  Snaut spoke up as the silence began to grow between us again    She already knows     about herself   I lowered my voice almost to a whisper  He raised his eyebrows 
  Yes 
I got the impression that he wasnt really surprised  Why was he pretending then  In an instant I felt sick of talking  but I persisted  Let it be loyalty  I thought  if nothing else 
  She had started guessing probably from our conversation in the library  watched me  added one thing to another  then found Gibarians tape recorder and listened to the tape    
He didnt change his position  still leaning against the cabinet  but there was a tiny glint in his eyes  Standing at the desktop  I had a wing of the door in front of me  ajar to the corridor  I lowered my voice even further 
  That night  while I was sleeping  she tried to kill herself  Liquid oxygen   
Something rustled like a draught in the loose papers  I was immobile  listening to what was in the corridor  but the source of the rustling was closer  It rattled like a mouse     A mouse  Nonsense  There were no mice here  I watched from under my eyes the seated man 
  Im listening   he said calmly 
  Of course  she didnt make it    in any case  she knows who she is 
  Why are you telling me this    he asked suddenly  I didnt know at first what to say 
  I want you to know    to know how it is  I muttered 
  I warned you 
  You want to say that you knew   I raised my voice in spite of myself 
  No  Of course you didnt  But I explained to you how it is  Every visitor  when he turns up  is almost a phantom  except for a disjointed jumble of memories and images  drawn from his     Adam    is actually   empty  The longer he is here with you  the more he humanises himself  It also becomes more independent  up to certain limits  one is supposed to understand  Therefore  the longer it goes on  the more difficult it becomes    
He paused  He looked at me blankly and said 
  She knows everything 
  Yes  I already told you 
  Everything  And that shes been here once before and that you    
  No  He smiled 
  Kelvin  listen  if youve got to this point    what are you actually going to do  Leave the Station 
  Yes 
  With her 
  Yes 
He was silent  as if contemplating an answer  but there was something else in his silence     what  Again that indistinct breeze rustled just as if behind a thin wall  He moved in his chair 
  Excellent  he said    What are you looking at  Did you think I was going to stand in your way  You do as you please  my dear  Wed look pretty if  on top of everything else  we started to use coercion here  Im not going to convince you  Ill just tell you this  you are trying   in an inhuman situation   to behave like a human being  That may be beautiful  but it is futile  Besides  I am not sure about this beauty either  because can what is stupid be beautiful  But thats not the point  You give up on further experience  you want to leave  taking it away  Yes 
  Yes 
  But that is also an    experience  Do you think 
  How do you understand it  Will she    be able to     If together with me  I dont see    
I spoke slower and slower until I broke off  Snaut sighed slightly 
  Were all playing ostrich politics here  Kelvin  but at least we know that and were not posing as noble 
  Im not posing as anything 
  OK  I didnt mean to offend you  I take back what I said about nobility  but ostrich politics remains in place  You are practising it in a particularly dangerous form  You lie to yourself and to her  and to yourself again  Do you know the conditions for stabilising a system made of neutri new matter 
  No  And you do not know  Nobody knows that 
  Of course  But one thing we do know is that such a system is impermanent and can only exist thanks to a continuous supply of energy  I know this from Sartorius  This energy produces a dislocated stabilising field  Well  is this field external to the guest  Or is the source of this field within his body  Do you comprehend the difference 
  Yes   I said slowly    If it is external  then    she  its    such a   
  It is when moving away from Solaris that the system will fall apart   he finished for me    We cant predict that  but youve done the experiment after all  That rocket you fired    its still circulating  you know  I even calculated the elements of its movement in my spare time  You can fly  go into orbit  get close to it  and then you can see what happened to the    passenger   
  Youre crazy    I hissed 
  Is that what you think  Well    what if    get her down here  this racket  It can be done  Its remote controlled  We bring it down from orbit and   
  Stop it 
  Also  no  So there is one way  very simple  It doesnt even have to land on the Station  Yes  let her orbit on  Well just connect with her by radio  if shes alive  shell call back and    
  But  but thats where the oxygen ran out a long time ago    I mouthed   
  Maybe shes getting around without oxygen  Well  shall we try 
  Snaut    Snaut   
  Kclvin    Kelvin      he was teasing me angrily    Come to think of it  what kind of person are you  Who do you want to make happy  To save  Yourself  Her  Which one  This one or that one  Dont you have the courage for both  You see for yourself where this leads  Im telling you for the last time  this  here  is an extramoral situation 
Suddenly I heard the same scraping sound as before  as if someone was scratching at the wall with their fingernails  I dont know why I was overwhelmed by a kind of passive  mulish stillness  It was as if I was viewing the whole situation  the two of us  everything from a great distance through upturned binoculars  petty  ridiculous a little  unimportant 
  So fine  I said    And what do you think I should do  Remove it  Shell turn up the same tomorrow  wont she  And again  And so every day  For how long  For what  Whats in it for me  Whats in it for you  Sartorius  The station 
  No  you answer me first  You will take off with her and  shall we say  witness the following transformation  In a few minutes you will see before you   
  Well  what    I said with a sneer    A monster  A demon  eh 
  No  The usual  most ordinary agony  Do you really believe in their immortality anymore 
I assure you  they die    What will you do then  Go back for    reserve 
  Stop it      I roared clenching my fist 
He looked at me with indulgent derision in his squinted eyes 
  Ah  am I the one whos supposed to stop  You know  if I were you  Id give this conversation a rest  Youd be better off doing something else  you could be chopping up the ocean with rods   with a vengeance   for example  What do you mean  So  if   he made a filial gesture of farewell with his hand  raising his eyes to the ceiling at the same time  as if he were following some distant figure   youre going rogue  And so  wont you  To smile when you feel like howling  to feign joy and peace when you want to bite your fingers  then youre not a scoundrel  And what if you cant not be here  What then  Youre going to rage in front of Snaut  whos to blame for everything  right  Well  then on top of that youre still an idiot  my dear    
  Youre talking about yourself   I said with a lowered head    I    I love her 
  Who  Your memory 
  No  Her  I told you what she wanted to do  Thats not what any    a real person 
  You admit it yourself  saying   
  Dont mince my words 
  Good  So she loves you  And you want to love her  Its not the same thing 
  Youre wrong 
  Kelvin  Im sorry  but you have entered into these intimate affairs of yours  You dont love  You love  Shes ready to give up her life  So are you  Very touching  very beautiful  noble  everything you want  But theres no room for all that  There isnt  Do you understand  No  you dont want to understand it  You are caught up  through forces beyond your control  in a circular process of which she is a part  A phase  A repetitive rhythm  If she were    if you were being stalked by a mascot ready to do anything for you  you wouldnt hesitate for a moment to remove her  Right 
  True 
  So  then  maybe thats why shes not such a mascot  That ties your hands  Thats the whole point of having your hands tied 
  Its one more hypothesis to the million out there in the library  Snaut  come on  shes     no 
I dont want to talk about it with you 
  Good  You started it yourself  But just think  she is essentially a mirror in which part of your brain is reflected  If shes great  its because great was your memory 
You gave the recipe  A circular process  dont forget 
  So what do you want from me  For me to    to remove it  I already asked you  why should I do it  You didnt answer 
  So Ill answer you now  I didnt invite you to this conversation  I have not touched your business  I am not ordering you or forbidding you anything and I would not do it even if I could  It was you  you who came here and laid everything out in front of me  and do you know why  No  to get it off my chest  To knock it off  I know the burden  my dear  Yes  yes  dont interrupt me  Im not interrupting you with anything  but you  you want me to interrupt you  If I stood in your way  maybe youd smash my head in too  then youd be dealing with me  someone made of the same blood and clay as you  and youd feel like a man yourself  And so    you cant live up to that and thats why youre debating with me     and in fact with yourself  Just tell me again that you would be bent on suffering if she disappeared all at once  no  dont say anything 
  Well  you know  Ive come to tell you by simple loyalty that I intend to leave the Station with her  I countered his attack  but I sounded unconvinced myself  Snaut shrugged his shoulders 
  Its very possible that you have to stay with yours  If I have spoken at all on the matter  it is only because you are going higher and higher  and the fall from the heights  you understand yourself     Come tomorrow morning around nine oclock upstairs to Sartorius     Will you come 
  To Sartorius  I was surprised    After all  he doesnt let anyone in  you said you couldnt even telephone 
  Now hes managed somehow  We dont talk about it  you know  You are    its quite different  Well  less so  Will you come in the morning 
  Ill come   I muttered  I looked at Snaut  His left hand  as if unwillingly  was hiding behind the wardrobe door  When had it swung open  Probably quite a long time ago  but in the excitement of this dreadful conversation for me I paid no attention to it  How unnatural it looked     As if    He was hiding something there  Or as if someone was holding his hand  I licked my lips 
  Snaut  what are you    
  Come out   he said quietly  very calmly    Come out 
I went out and closed the door behind me in the last of the red glow  Harey was sitting on the floor  about ten paces away  against the wall itself  She broke off at the sight of me    Do you see       She said looking at me with sparkling eyes    We did it  Kris    Im so  happy  Maybe    maybe it will get better and better   
  Oh  for sure   I replied absentmindedly  We were getting back together  and I was cracking my head over this idiotic wardrobe  So  so he was hiding in there     And all this talk     My cheeks started to burn so much that I rubbed them in spite of myself  God  what madness  And where did it actually stop  Nothing  True  tomorrow morning   
And suddenly I was gripped by fear  almost like last night  My encephalogram  The complete record of all brain processes  translated into fluctuations of a bunch of rays  will be sent down  Into the depths of this infinite  boundless monster  As he said   if it disappeared  you would suffer terribly  eh       The encephalogram is a total record  Also the unconscious processes  If I want it to disappear  die  Would I otherwise be so horrified that she survived this terrible assassination  Can one be responsible for ones own subconscious  If I am not responsible for her  who would be  What idiocy  Why on earth did I agree that precisely my  my     I can naturally study it for myself beforehand  this record  but I cant read it  Nobody can do that  Specialists can only determine what the researcher was thinking about  but these are only generalities  that  for example  he was solving a mathematical problem  but they cant say what kind of problem  They claim its impossible  because the encephalogram is a resultant  a mixture of a whole lot of simultaneous processes  and only some of them have a mental  lining     And the subconscious    They dont want to talk about these at all  and where are they already in reading someones memories  repressed or not repressed     But why am I so afraid  After all  I myself said to Harey this morning that this experiment wont do anything  Well  because if our neurophysiologists cant read the recording  where would this most alien  black  liquid giant    
But he entered me nor do I know how  to traverse my entire memory and invent its most painful atom  How can I doubt that  And this without any help  without any
 radial transmission   he forced his way through the double encapsulated armour  through the heavy shells of the Station  searched inside my body and left with his loot    
  Kris       quietly spoke up Harey  I stood at the window  gazing with unseeing eyes into the beginning of the night  Faint at this latitude  a delicate whiteness obscured the stars  A uniform  though thin  coating of clouds so high that the sun  from deep below the horizon  bestowed upon them the faintest pink silver scorch 
If it disappears later  it will mean that I wanted it  That I killed it  Not to go there  They cant make me  But what will I tell them  This   no  I cant  Yes  you have to pretend  you have to lie  over and over again  But that is because there are thoughts  intentions  hopes  cruel  wonderful  murderous  in me  perhaps  and I know nothing about them  Man has set out to meet other worlds  other civilisations  without fully knowing his own nooks and crannies  blind roads  wells  barricaded  dark doors  To hand her over to them     out of shame  To give it away just because I lack the courage 
  Kris      whispered Harey even more quietly than before  I felt rather than heard her silently approach me  and I pretended not to know anything about it  At that moment I wanted to be alone  I needed to be alone  I had not yet conquered anything  no decision  no resolution had been made  Gazing up at the darkening sky  at the stars that were but the spectral shadow of earthly stars  I stood motionless  and in the emptiness that replaced the chase of thoughts from a moment before  grew the wordless  indifferent certainty that where I could not reach  I had already chosen and  pretending that nothing had happened  I did not even have the strength to despise myself
