I lay on my back  with her head on my shoulder  without a single thought  The darkness filling the room was populating  I heard footsteps  The walls were disappearing  Something was piling up above me  higher and higher  boundless  Penetrated to the core  embraced without touching  I froze in the darkness  felt its transparency  sharp  displacing the air  Very far away I could hear my heart  I focused all my attention  the rest of my strength on waiting for the agony  It was not coming  I only continued to diminish  and the invisible sky  the invisible horizons  the space  devoid of shapes  clouds  stars  retreating and immense made me its centre  I tried to crawl into what I was lying on  but there was nothing beneath me and the darkness no longer shielded anything  I clasped my hands together  covered my face with them 
I didnt have it anymore  My fingers went all the way through  I wanted to scream  to howl    
The room was blue grey  The furnishings  the shelves  the corners of the walls hailed as if in broad  dull strokes  just shrouded  without a colour of their own  The brightest  pearly white in the silence outside the window  My body was wet with sweat  I glanced sideways  she was looking at me 
  Did you get an aching shoulder 
  What 
She lifted her head  Her eyes were the same colour as the room  grey  luminous between black lashes  I felt the warmth of her whisper before I understood the words 
  No  Oh  yes 
I put my hand on her shoulder  The touch tingled  I slowly took her in with my other hand 
  You had a bad dream 
  A dream  yes  a dream  And you were awake 
  I dont know  Maybe you didnt  Im not sleepy  But you sleep  Why are you looking like that 
I closed my eyes  I could feel the tiny  steady beat of her heart where mine was slower to strike  A prop  I thought  But nothing surprised me  not even my own indifference  Fear and despair were beyond me  I was further away  oh  so far away no one had ever been before  I touched her neck with my lips  went down into the small hollow between the tendons  smooth as the inside of a seashell  And here the pulse was beating 
I raised myself up on my elbow  No aurora  no softness of dawn  the horizon was encompassed by an electric blue glow  the first ray swept through the room like a shot  everything played with reflections  rainbow reflections broke apart in the mirror  in the doorknobs  in the nickel pipes  it seemed as if the light was striking every plane it encountered  as if it wanted to liberate itself  to burst the cramped room  It was no longer possible to look  I turned away  Hareys pupils had diminished  Grey irises rose towards my face 
  Is it time for daylight yet    She asked in a dull voice  It was like half dream  half java 
  Its always like that here  darling 
  And us 
  What about us 
  Are we going to be here long 
I wanted to laugh  But when the indistinct sound broke from my chest  it wasnt like laughing 
  I think quite a long time  Dont you want to 
Her eyelids didnt twitch  She was looking at me intently  Was she blinking  I wasnt sure  She pulled the blanket up and a small triangular birthmark blushed on her shoulder 
  Why are you looking at me like that 
  Because youre beautiful 
She smiled  But it was just a courtesy  a thank you for the compliment    Really  Because you look as if    like Im   
  What 
  Like youre looking for something 
  Youre telling 
  No  as if you think theres something wrong with me or that I havent told you something 
  But no 
  If youre in denial like that  then sure  But as you wish 
Behind the flared windows a dead blue heat was born  Shielding my eyes with my hand  I looked for my glasses  They were lying on the table  I knelt on the bed  put them on and saw her reflection in the mirror  She was expecting something  When I lay down next to her again  she smiled    And for me  I suddenly understood 
  Glasses 
I got up and started rummaging through the drawers  on the table under the window  I found two pairs  both too big  I handed them to her  She tried both on  They fell halfway down her nose 
With a prolonged rasping sound  the window lids began to slide open  A moment and night fell inside the Station  which  like a tortoise  hid in its shell  In the dark  I took off her glasses and put them under the bed with my own 
  What are we going to do    she asked 
  What one does at night  sleep 
  Kris 
  What 
  Maybe Ill make you a new wrap 
  No  you dont need to  Im fine    love 
When I said this  I didnt understand myself if I was pretending  but at once I blindly embraced her slender back in the darkness and  feeling them tremble  I believed her  Anyway  I dont know  It suddenly seemed to me that it was I who was deceiving her  not she who was deceiving me  because she was only herself 
I fell asleep a few more times after that and still a cramp pulled me out of my slumber  my rumbling heart calmed slowly  I pressed her to me  deathly weary  she was investigatively touching my face  my forehead  very carefully  checking if I had a fever  It was Harey  There could be no other  no truer 
After this thought  something changed in me  I stopped fighting  I fell asleep almost immediately  I was awakened by a gentle touch  A pleasant chill enveloped my forehead  I lay with my face covered with something damp and soft that rose slowly  I looked into Hareys face bent over me  With both hands she was squeezing the excess fluid from the gauze into a porcelain bowl  Next to it stood a flask of scalding liquid  She smiled at me 
  What a dream you have  she said and put the gauze back on    Does it hurt 
  No 
I moved the skin of my forehead  Indeed  the burns were not bothering me now  Harey was sitting on the edge of the bed  wrapped in a mens bathrobe  white with orange stripes  her black hair spilling over the collar  She had rolled her sleeves up high to her elbows so they wouldnt get in the way  I felt incredibly hungry  I dont think I had had anything in my mouth for twenty hours  When Harey had finished the treatments to my face  I stood up  My gaze fell raptly on two pretty identical white dresses with red buttons lying next to each other  the first one I had helped her remove by cutting her neckline  and the second one she had come in yesterday  This time she ripped the seam herself with scissors  She said Im sure the zipper was jammed 
These two identical dresses were the scariest of everything I had experienced so far  Harey was bustling around the medicine cabinet  tidying it up  I surreptitiously turned away from her and bit my fist to the bone  Still looking at the two dresses   or rather  one and the same dress  repeated twice   I started backing towards the door  The water was still dripping from the tap  making a noise  I opened the door  slipped quietly out into the corridor and closed it carefully  I could hear the faint murmur of running water and the clanking of flasks  suddenly this sound stopped  In the corridor the oblong ceiling lamps were blazing  an indistinct patch of reflected light lay on the surface of the door  at which I waited with clenched jaws  I held the handle  though I didnt expect to be able to hold it  A violent jerk almost snatched it out of my hand  but the door did not open  it only breathlessly creaked  I let go of the handle in a daze and stepped back  something unbelievable was happening to the door  its smooth plastic panel bending  as if forced from my side into the room  The enamel began to chip off in tiny crumbs  exposing the steel of the doorframe  which strained ever tighter  Suddenly I understood  instead of pushing the door  which swung away into the corridor  she was trying to open it  pulling it towards herself  A reflection of light twisted on the white sheet as if in a concave mirror  a powerful crunch sounded and the uniform sheet  bent to the extreme  crackled  Simultaneously  the handle  torn from its sludge  flew into the room  Instantly  bloody hands showed themselves in the opening and  leaving red marks on the paintwork  dragged on   the door panel broke in two  hung diagonally from its hinges and an orange and white creature with a bruised dead face threw itself on my chest  shuddering from sobs 
Had it not been for the sight of it paralysing me  I think I would have tried to escape  Harey was convulsively catching her breath  beating her head against my shoulder until her dishevelled hair flew  When I put my arms around her  I felt her fly through my hands  I carried her into the room  squeezing past the shattered door leaf  and laid her on the bed  Her nails were dripping with blood and broken  When she turned her hand over  I saw the inside of her palm stripped to living flesh  I looked into her face  open eyes looked through me  expressionless 
  Harey 
She replied with an inarticulate mutter 
I brought my finger close to her eye  The eyelid fluttered shut  I walked over to the medicine cabinet  The bed creaked  I turned around  She sat upright  looking fearfully at her bleeding hands 
  Kris  she moaned  I    I    what happened to me 
  You hurt yourself breaking down the door   I said dryly  I had something in my lips  especially the lower one  as if ants were walking all over it  I clenched it with my teeth 
Harey stared for a moment at the toothed chunks of plastic hanging loosely from the doorframe and then returned her eyes to me  Her chin trembled  I could see the effort with which she tried to contain her fear  I cut the flaps of gauze  took the wound salve from the cupboard and returned to the bed  Everything I was carrying slipped rapidly out of my lowered hands  the glass jar with the gelatine membrane broke  but I didnt even lean over  It was no longer needed 
I lifted her hand  The dried blood still surrounded the nails with a thin border  but the crushing had disappeared and the inside of her hand was covered with lighter pink skin than its surroundings 
The scar  moreover  was almost fading before my eyes 
I sat up  stroked her face and tried to smile at her  I cant say I succeeded 
  Why did you do that  Harey 
  No  It was    Me 
She pointed to the door with her eyes 
  Yes  Dont you remember 
  No  I mean  I saw you were gone  I got very scared and    
  And what 
  I started looking for you  I thought maybe you were in the bathroom    
Now I only noticed that the wardrobe  pushed aside  showed the entrance to the bathroom 
  And then 
  I ran to the door 
  And then what 
  I dont remember  Something must have happened 
  What 
  I dont know 
  What do you remember  What happened next 
  I was sitting here  on the bed 
  And the way I brought you in  you dont remember 
She hesitated  The corners of her mouth lowered down  her face tensed 
  I think  Maybe  I dont know myself  She lowered her feet to the floor and stood up  She walked over to the shattered door 
  Kris 
I took her shoulders from behind  She was trembling  Suddenly she turned around  looking for my eyes    Kris   she whispered   Kris 
  Calm down 
  Kris  if  Kris  do I have epilepsy  Epilepsy  good God  I wanted to laugh 
  Wheres that  love  Its just the door  you know  theres such a  well  such a door    
We left the room as the outer armoire  with a draughty rasp  uncovered the windows  revealing a sun dappled ocean 
I headed for the small kitchen room at the opposite end of the corridor  Harey and I hosted together  shuffling through cupboards and fridges  I soon noticed that she was not very good at cooking and could do little more than open cans of tinned food  which was as much as I could do  I devoured the contents of two such tins and drank countless cups of coffee  Harey also ate  but in the way that children sometimes eat  not wanting to make an adult uncomfortable  not even with compulsion  but mechanically and indifferently 
We then went to the small operations room next to the radio station  I had a plan  I said I wanted to examine her as a precaution  sat her down on the folding chair and got the syringe and needles out of the steriliser  I knew where to find what  almost by heart  thats how we had been forced into the training copy of the Station  on Earth  I took a drop of blood from her finger  made a smear  dried it in the exhauster and dusted it with silver ions in a high vacuum 
The matter of factness of the job had a calming effect  Harey  resting on the cushions of an unfolded chair  looked around the camera crowded interior of the surgery 
The silence was broken by the intermittent buzz of an internal telephone  I picked up the receiver 
  Kelvin   I said  I didnt take my eyes off Harey  who had been lethargic for some time  as if exhausted by the experiences of the last few hours 
  Are you in surgery  Finally    I heard a sort of sigh of relief 
Snaut was speaking  I waited with the receiver pressed to my ear    You have a visitor  huh 
  Yes 
  And are you busy 
  Yes   
  That kind of research  hm 
  Why  do you want to play a game of chess 
  Come on  Kelvin  Sartorius wants to see you  I mean  with us 
  Thats new   I replied surprised    What about       I broke off and finished 
  Is he alone 
  No  I expressed myself badly  He wants to talk to us  The three of us will connect via wi fi  only the screens will be obscured 
  Oh yeah  Then why didnt he call me directly  Is he ashamed 
  Something like that  burbled Snaut uncomfortably    Then how 
  You mean we should make an appointment  Lets say  in an hour  Okay 
  Okay 
I saw him on the screen  his face alone  no bigger than the palm of my hand  For a moment  marked by a slight hum of electricity  he looked into my eyes investigatively 
Finally  he spoke up with some hesitation 
  How is life for you 
  Weary  How about you 
  A little worse than you  I suppose  Could I   
  Would you like to come to my place    I guessed  I looked over my shoulder at Harey  She had tilted her head over the cushion and was lying with her leg put on  tossing with a gesture of clueless boredom the silver ball that ended in a chain at the armchair railing 
  Leave it  do you hear  Leave it  you    came to me in Snauts raised voice  I saw his profile in the screen  I couldnt hear the rest  he had covered the microphone with his hand  but I could see his lips moving 
  No  I cant come  Maybe later  So in an hour  he said quickly and the screen went blank 
I hung up the phone 
  Who was that    Harey asked indifferently 
  Thats the one  Snaut  A cyberneticist  You dont know him 
  Is this going to last much longer 
  Why  are you bored    I asked  I inserted the first of a series of slides into the cassette of the neutrino microscope and pressed the coloured switch knobs one by one  The force fields boomed deafeningly 
  Theres not much entertainment here  and if my humble company isnt enough for you  its going to be crummy  I said  extending the pauses between words absentmindedly  at the same time I pulled down with both hands the large black head in which the microscope eyepiece shone and pressed my eyes deep into the soft rubber shell  Harey said something that didnt occur to me 
I saw from above  in steep relief  a vast desert  flooded with a silver glow  Lying on it  surrounded by an indistinct haze  as if shattered and weathered  were flat rounds of rock  They were red bodies  I sharpened the image and  without taking my eyes off my glasses  I flowed  as it were  deeper and deeper into the blazing silvery field of vision  At the same time  I turned the adjustment crank of the table with my left hand  and when the blood cell  lying alone like an erratic boulder  found itself at the junction of the black threads  I increased the magnification  The lens invaded the seemingly distorted  sunken erythrocyte in the middle  which already appeared to be a coliseum of rocky crater  with black  sharp shadows in the indentations of the annular rim  This rim  invaded by crystallised deposits of silver ions  escaped me beyond the boundaries of the microscopic field  The outlines of half fused  bent protein chains appeared cloudy  as if seen through iridescent water  With one narrowing of the protein ruins at the black junction  I pushed the magnification lever slowly further  further and further  the end of this journey into the depths was about to appear  the flattened shadow of one molecule filling the entire image  flared now 
Nothing happened  however  I should have seen twitching mists of atoms  like a gelatinous quiver  but there were none  The screen was blazing with immaculate silver  I pushed the lever all the way down  The buzzing intensified angrily  but I could still see nothing  The repeated buzzing signal let me know that the apparatus was overloaded  I looked once more into the silver void and switched off the electricity 
I looked at Harey  She was just opening her mouth in a yawn  which she deftly turned into a smile 
  Hows it going with me    She asked 
  Very well  I said    I think    it couldnt be better 
I continued to look at her  feeling that antsy feeling in my lower lip again  What had actually happened  What did it mean  This body  seemingly so limp and fragile   in fact indestructible   in its ultimate bottom turned out to be composed of nothingness  I slammed my fist into the cylindrical body of the microscope  Perhaps a defect of some kind  Maybe the fields werent focusing     No  I knew the apparatus was operational  I went down all the rungs  the cells  the protein conglomerate  the molecules  all looked exactly like the thousands of slides I had seen  But the last step down led nowhere 
I took her blood from the vein and poured it into a graduated cylinder  I separated it into portions and set about analysing it  It took me longer than I thought it would  I had lost some practice 
The reactions were normal  All of them  I guess to   
I dropped a drop of concentrated acid on a red bead  It smoked  the drop went grey  covered in a coating of dirty foam  Decomposition  Denaturation  Come on  come on  I reached for the test tube  As I turned towards that one  the thin glass almost fell out of my fingers 
Beneath the layer of dirty scum at the very bottom of the test tube  a layer of dark red was once again building up  The blood  burned with acid  was reproducing itself  This was nonsense  It was impossible 
  Kris    I heard as if from a great distance    The phone  Kris 
  What  Oh yes  thank you  The phone had been buzzing for a long time  only now I heard it 
  Kelvin   I picked up the phone 
  Snaut  I switched the line so that the three of us could hear each other at the same time 
  Hello  Dr Kelvin   Sartorius high  nasal voice rang out  It sounded as if its owner was ascending a dangerously yielding podium  suspicious  alert and outwardly poised 
  My respects to the doctor  I replied  I wanted to laugh  but I wasnt sure if the reasons for this merriment were clear enough for me to indulge it  Who  after all  was I supposed to be laughing at  I held something in my hand  a test tube of blood  I shook it  It had coagulated already 
Maybe the moment before was just an illusion  Maybe it just appeared to me 
  I wanted to make some points to my colleagues about    e    phantoms   I heard and didnt hear Sartorius at the same time  It was as if he was knocking at my consciousness  I defended myself against this voice  still staring at the tube of clotted blood 
  Lets call them F creatures  surrendered Snaut quickly 
  And perfectly 
A vertical line darkened in the middle of the screen as a sign that I was receiving two channels at the same time   on either side of it should have been the faces of my interlocutors  The glass was dark  however  and only a narrow border of bludgeoning along the frame testified that the apparatus was working  but the screens were obscured by something 
  We each carried out a variety of examinations       again the same caution in the nasal voice of the speaker  A moment of silence    Perhaps we could combine our messages first  and then I could speak what I have come to personally     Perhaps you can go first  Dr Kelvin       Me   I said  Suddenly I felt Hareys gaze on me  I put the test tube down on the table  so that it rolled under the glass racks  and sat down on the high tripod  drawing it to myself with my foot 
At the first moment I wanted to excuse myself  but unsurprisingly to myself I said 
  Good  A little conversation  Good  I have done as much as nothing  but I can talk  One histological preparation and a few reactions  Micro reactions  I got the impression that   
Up to that point  I had no idea what to say  Suddenly  it was as if something opened up inside me 
  Everything is normal  but its camouflage  A mask  It is  in a sense  a super copy 
a recreation  more accurate than the original  That is to say  where in man we meet the end of granularity  the end of structural divisibility  here there is a further path thanks to the use of sub atomic building blocks 
  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  How do you understand this    Sartorius questioned  Snaut did not speak  Or was it his accelerated breathing that rang out in the earpiece  Harey looked in my direction 
I became aware of my own excitement  the last words almost shouted 
Having cooled down  I hunched over my uncomfortable chariot and closed my eyes  How to express this    The ultimate building blocks of our bodies are atoms  I suppose F creatures are made up of units smaller than ordinary atoms  Far smaller 
  From mesons       prompted Sartorius  He was not at all surprised 
  No  not from mesons     Mesons would be discernible  The resolution of this apparatus here  down here with me  reaches ten to minus twenty Angstroem  Right  But you cant see anything  until the end 
So not mesons  Probably more like neutrinos 
  How do you figure that out  Because  after all  neutrino conglomerates are not permanent    
  I dont know  Im not a physicist  Perhaps  they are stabilised by some kind of force field  I dont know about that  In any case  if it is as I say  the building blocks are particles about ten thousand times smaller than atoms  But that is not all  If protein molecules and cells were made up directly of these micro atoms  they would have to be correspondingly smaller  And blood cells too  and ferments  everything  but this is not the case  From this it follows that all proteins  cells  cell nuclei are just a mask  The real structure  responsible for the functioning of the guest  is hidden deeper 
  But  Kelvin    shouted Snaut almost  I broke off horrified  I said guest  Yes  but Harey didnt hear it  Besides  she wouldnt have understood  She stared at the window  resting her head on her hand  her small  clean profile drawn against the purple aurora  The receiver was silent  All I could hear was distant breathing 
  Theres something in that  muttered Snaut 
  Yes  its possible  Sartorius added  only we have the scowl that the ocean is not made of these hypothetical Kel vin particles  It is made of ordinary ones 
  Maybe it can synthesise those too  I remarked  I felt a sudden apathy  This conversation wasnt even funny  It was unnecessary 
  But it would explain the extraordinary endurance   Snaut muttered    And the rate of regeneration  Maybe even the energy source is there  deep down  they dont have to eat after all    
  Please speak up  Sartorius spoke up  I hated him  If only he hadnt at least fallen out of his self imposed role 
  I want to raise the question of motivation  The motivation for the appearance of F creatures  I would break it down like this  what are F creatures  They are not persons or copies of specific persons  but materialised projections of what our brains contain about a person 
The accuracy of this term struck me  This Sartorius  however antipathetic  was not stupid after all 
  Thats a good thing   I interjected    It even explains why there appeared personae     creations such and not others  The memory traces chosen were the most durable  the most isolated from all others  although  naturally  no such trace can be completely isolated and  in the course of  copying  it  remnants of other traces  found by chance in the vicinity  may have been seized  with the result that the newcomer sometimes shows more knowledge than the authentic person  whose repetition it is supposed to be   
  Kelvin    Snaut spoke up again  It struck me that he was the only one who was offended by my careless words  Sartorius seemed not to fear them  Did this mean that his  guest  was inherently less astute than Snauts  guest   For a second  the image of some dwarfish moron with the learned Dr Sartorius at his side sprang up in my mind 
  Yes  we have noticed that   he just replied    Now  as for the motivation for the appearance of Fs creations    The first  natural as it were  is the thought of an experiment being carried out on us  However  it would be a rather    lousy  If we do an experiment  we learn from the results  above all from our mistakes  so that in its repetition we make corrections     Meanwhile  this is not even mentioned  The same F creations appear again and again     uncorrected    not armed additionally against our    attempts to get rid of them    
  In a word  there is no corrective feedback loop of action  as Dr Snaut would put it   I noticed    And what is the result of this 
  Only that as an experiment it would be a      foul  otherwise improbable  The ocean is    precise  This manifests itself  for example  in the two layer structure of F creatures  Up to a certain limit  they behave as they would behave in     real    real   
He could not break out 
  The originals  Snaut prompted quickly 
  Yes  originals  But when the situation exceeds the normal capabilities of the average     e   
originals  there is  as it were  a switching off of the consciousness of the F creature  and a different action  an inhuman one  manifests itself directly    
  That is true  I said  but in this way we only arrange a catalogue of the behaviour of these     of these creations and nothing more  It is completely sterile 
  Im not so sure about that  protested Sartorius  Suddenly I realised what he was teasing me about  he wasnt speaking  he was speaking  just like at an Institute meeting  Apparently he could not do otherwise 
  This is where the issue of individuality comes into play  The ocean is completely devoid of the concept of individuality  It has to be that way  It seems to me  colleagues  that this one for us     e    most sensitive  shocking side of the experiment completely escapes him as lying beyond the limits of his understanding    Do you think this is not deliberate       I asked  The claim stunned me a little  but on reflection I admitted that it was impossible to rule it out 
  Yes  I do not believe in any perfidy  any malice  any desire for the most severe stabbing     as my colleague Snaut does 
  I dont attribute human feelings to him at all   Snaut spoke up for the first time   but perhaps you can say how you are trying to explain these constant returns 
  Maybe theyve set up some kind of device that works over and over again  like a gramophone record  I said  not without a hidden desire to tease Sartorius 
  Please colleagues  lets not get distracted  the doctor declared in a nasal voice    Thats not all I wanted to say yet  Under normal circumstances  I would consider it premature to report even provisionally on the status of my work  but in view of the specific situation  I will make an exception  I have the impression  I repeat  I have the impression  no more for the moment  that there is validity in my colleague Kelvins conjecture  I am referring to his hypothesis of a neutrino structure     We know such systems only theoretically  we did not know that they could be stabilised  Here a definite opportunity opens up  for the nullification of that force field which gives the system its permanence     I had already noticed for some time that this dark thing  which was obscuring the screen on the Sartorius side  was moving  at the very top  a gap shone and you could see something pink moving slowly there  Now the dark plane slipped suddenly    Down  Down      came Sartoriuss agonising shout through the headset  In the suddenly brightened screen  between the doctors hands struggling with something  clad in the buffy sleeves used in laboratories  a large  golden  disc like object shone  and everything went blank before I even realised that the golden circle was a straw hat    
  Snaut    I said taking a deep breath 
  Yes  Kelvin  replied my tired cybernetic voice  I felt in that moment that I liked him  I really preferred not to know who accompanied him 
  Weve had enough for now  eh 
  I think   I replied    Listen  if you can  come downstairs or to my cabin  okay    I added hastily  so that he wouldnt have time to hang up 
  Agreed  he said    But I dont know when 
And that was the end of the problematic discussion
