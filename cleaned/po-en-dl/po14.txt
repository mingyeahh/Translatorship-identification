i sat at the big window and looked out at the ocean  i had nothing to do  the report  compiled in five days  was now a beam of waves  rushing through a vacuum somewhere beyond the constellation orion  when it reached the dark dust nebula  which spreads over an area of eight trillion cubic miles and absorbs every signal and ray of light  it would encounter the first of a chain of relays  from there  from one radiobeacon to the next  in leaps of billions of kilometres  it will glide along the curvature of a giant arc until the last relay  a metallic lump  full of tightly packed precision instruments  with an elongated snout of a directional antenna  focuses it once more and presses it further into space  towards earth  then  months will pass  and the same burst of energy  dragging behind it a furrow of percussive distortions in the gravitational field of the galaxy  launched from the earth  will reach the front of the cosmic cloud  glide  amplified along a necklace of slowly drifting buoys  and  with undiminished vigour  will hurtle towards the twin suns of solaris  the ocean under the high red sun was blacker than ever  a red mist melted its contacts with the sky  this day was exceptionally steamy  as if it heralded one of those exceedingly rare and beyond imagination violent storms that haunt the planet several times a year  there is reason to believe that its sole inhabitant controls the climate and brings these storms on its own  for a few more months i was to look out of these windows  to watch from a height the freedoms of white gold and weary red  occasionally reflected in some liquid eruption  in a silvery bubble of symmetry  to follow the wandering of wind slanted  slender chisels  to encounter half weathered  sludgy mimoids  one day  all the screens of the visophones will start fluttering with light  all the electron signalling  long dead  will come to life  triggered by a pulse  sent from hundreds of thousands of kilometres away  heralding the approach of a metallic colossus which  with a draughty thunder of gravitors  will lower itself over the ocean  it will be ulysses or
prometheus  or some other of the great long range cruisers  as i ascend the gangway from the flat roof of the station  i will see on the decks ranks of white armoured  massive automatons that share no original sin with man and are so innocent that they will obey any order until they have completely destroyed themselves or any obstacle that stands in their way  if that is how their crystal oscillating memory has been programmed  and then the ship will move  silently  faster than a voice  leaving behind an ocean reaching cone of thunder split into bass octaves  and the faces of all the people will light up for a moment at the thought that they are coming home 
but i had no home  earth  i thought of its great  crowded  sweltering cities  where i would get lost  lose myself almost as if i had done what i wanted to do the second or third night   throw myself into the ocean  rippling hard in the darkness  i will drown in people  i will be a silent and attentive  and thus a valued companion  i will have many acquaintances  even friends  and women  and maybe even one woman  for a time  i will have the compulsion to smile  to bow  to stand up  to do the thousands of small actions of which earthly life consists  until i no longer feel it  i will find new interests  new activities  but i will not give myself over to them all  to nothing or no one  ever again  and perhaps  i will look at night where  in the sky  the darkness of the dust cloud like a black veil holds back the radiance of two suns  remembering everything  even what i think now  and i will remember with an indulgent smile  in which there will be a hint of regret  but also of superiority  my follies and hopes  i do not at all consider this self from the future as something inferior to    who was ready to do anything for the cause  called contact  and no one will have the right to judge me 
  entered the cabin  he looked around  then looked at me  i got up and walked over to the table 
  did you want something 
  you seem to have nothing to do       he asked winking    i could give you  you know  there are some calculations  not the most urgent admittedly    
  thank you  i smiled  but its unnecessary 
  are you sure about that    he asked looking at the window 
  yes  i was thinking about things and    
  id rather you didnt think so much 
  ah  then youre completely missing the point  tell me  do you    do you believe in god  he looked at me sharply 
  what do you  who still believes today    there was anxiety smouldering in his eyes 
  its not that simple  i said in a deliberately light tone  because i dont mean the traditional god of earthly beliefs  im not a religionist and i may not have invented anything  but you dont happen to know if there was once a belief in a god     flawed 
  crippled    he repeated raising his eyebrows    how do you understand that  in a sense  the god of every religion was flawed  because he was burdened with human qualities  magnified only  the god of
of the old testament  for example  was a lusty frontal and sacrificial violent man  jealous of the other gods     the greek gods  through their quarrelsomeness  family feuds  were no less humanly flawed    
  no  i interrupted him  what i mean is a god whose imperfection is not due to the simple mindedness of his human creators  but is his most essential  immanent characteristic  it is to be a god  limited in his omniscience and omnipotence  fallible in foreseeing the future of his creations  whose course of the phenomena shaped by him can cause horror  it is a god     crippled  who always wants more than he can  and does not immediately realise it  one who has constructed clocks  but not the time they measure  systems or mechanisms  serving certain purposes  but they outgrew those purposes and betrayed them  and he created infinity  which  from being the measure of his power it was meant to be  became the measure of his boundless failure 
  once  manichaeism       began hesitantly     the suspicious reserve with which he had addressed me in recent times was gone 
  but this has nothing to do with the element of good and evil  i interrupted him immediately    this god does not exist outside of matter and cannot free himself from it  and that is all he wants       i know of no similar religion   he said after a moments silence    such has never been     needed  if i understand you correctly  and im afraid i do  youre thinking of some kind of evolving god who develops over time and grows up  ascending to ever higher heights of power  to an awareness of its powerlessness  this god of yours is a being who entered divinity as if it were a no win situation  and having grasped this  gave himself over to despair  yes  but a god in despair is a human being after all  my dear  you mean a human being    its not only poor philosophy  its even poor mysticism    no  i replied stubbornly  i dont mean a human being  it may be that with certain features he would fit this provisional definition  but that is only because it is full of gaps  man  contrary to appearances  does not create goals for himself  they are imposed on him by the time in which he is born  he can serve them or rebel against them  but the object of service or rebellion is given from outside  in order to experience the total freedom of seeking goals  he would have to be alone  and this cannot happen  because a man not brought up among men cannot become a man  this     mine must be a being without a plural  you know 
  ah  he said  that i immediately    and he pointed with his hand out of the window 
  no   i objected   and neither did he  at the most  as that which has missed the chance of divinity in its development  having too soon become obscured in itself  he is an anachoretic  a hermit of the cosmos rather than its god     he repeats himself     and the one im thinking of would never do so  perhaps he is being created somewhere  in some corner of the galaxy  and soon he will begin  in a fit of youthful intoxication  to extinguish some stars and ignite others we will notice after a while    
  we have already noticed   said   sourly    novae and supernovae    are these  in your opinion  the candles of his altar 
  if you want to take what i say so literally    
  or perhaps it is solaris that is the cradle of your divine infant    added  an increasingly clear smile surrounded his eyes with thin wrinkles    perhaps he is  in your understanding  the very first born  the seed of the god of despair  perhaps his vital childishness still surpasses his wits by mountains  and all that our solaris libraries contain is but a vast catalogue of his infantile reflexes    
  and we  on the other hand  were his toys for a time   i finished    yes  it is possible  and do you know what you managed to do  you have created a completely new hypothesis about solaris  which is no small thing  and immediately you have an explanation for the inability to make contact  the lack of answers  certain   lets call them that   extravagances in dealing with us  the psyche of a small child    
  he gives up the authorship   he muttered standing by the window  for a long moment we stared into the black undulation  at the eastern horizon a pale  oblong speck was drawn in the mist    where did you get this idea of a flawed god    he asked suddenly  without taking his eyes off the glare drenched desert 
  i dont know  it just seemed very  very real to me  you know  its the only god id be willing to believe in  whose passion is not redemptive  doesnt save anything  doesnt serve anything  just is 
  mimoid      said quite quietly  in a different voice   
  what are you saying  a yes  i noticed him before  very old 
we both stared into the hazy ruddy horizon    
  ill fly   i spoke up unexpectedly    especially as ive never left the station before  and this is a good opportunity  ill be back in half an hour   
  what do you say      opened his eyes    are you going to fly  to where 
  over there   i pointed to a flesh coloured spot peeking through the fog    whats the harm in that  ill take a small helicopter  it would be funny  you know  if   on earth   i had to admit one day that im a solarian whos never even set foot on solarian ground    
i walked over to the wardrobe and started flicking between suits    watched me  silently  until he said 
  i dont like this 
  what   i turned around with the suit in my hands  i was overwhelmed by an excitement i had not experienced for a long time    what do you mean  cards on the table  youre afraid that something    nonsense  i give you my word  no  i didnt even think about it  no  i really havent 
  ill fly with you 
  thank you  but i prefer alone  its something new though  something completely new  i said quickly  pulling on the suit    said something else  but i didnt really listen to him  looking for the things i needed 
he followed me to the airport  he helped me roll the machine out of the box to the centre of the launch pad 
as i was putting on my flight suit  he suddenly asked 
  does the word still have any value for you 
  great god     do you still  it has  and ive already given it to you  where are the reserve cylinders 
he said nothing more  when i closed the transparent dome  i gave him a sign with my hand  he started the jack  i drove slowly out to the top of the station  the motor woke up  made a draughty noise  the tri propeller whirred and the apparatus lifted strangely slightly  leaving the stations ever smaller  silvery disk below 
i was alone over the ocean for the first time  a very different sensation from that experienced at the windows  perhaps the lowness of the flight also caused this  i was gliding only a few dozen metres above the waves  only now i not only knew  but felt  that the alternating  greasily glistening humps and chasms of the abyss were moving not like a sea tide or a cloud  but like an animal  the relentless  though remarkably slow  contractions of the muscular  naked hull   thats what it looked like  the sleepily turning crest of each wave blazed red with foam  when i made a turn to come out exactly on the course of the mimic island drifting with extraordinary slowness  the sun hit me straight in the eyes  trembled with flashes of blood in the convex panes  and the ocean itself became ink red with mottles of dark fire 
the circle id made  not skilled enough  carried me far upwind  and the mimoid was left behind as a vast  bright blotch  cut off from the ocean by an irregular contour  it had lost the pink hue given to it by the mists  it was as yellowish as dried bone  and for a moment it disappeared from my sight  and instead i saw the station in the distance  hovering seemingly just above the ocean itself  like a huge  old fashioned zeppelin  i repeated the manoeuvre  straining all my attention  the mimic massif  with its steep  grotesque sculpture was growing on course  i thought i might catch the tallest of its bulbous protrusions  and i pulled the helicopter up so violently that  losing speed  the whole thing rocked  caution superfluous as the rounded tops of the bizarre towers sailed low below  i aligned the machines flight with the drifting island and slowly  metre by metre  began to lose altitude until the crumbling peaks rose above the cabin  it wasnt huge  from end to end it was perhaps three quarters of a mile long  and barely a few hundred metres wide  in some places it showed a narrowing that heralded the fact that it would soon break through there  it must have been a fragment of an incomparably larger formation  according to the solarian scale it was a tiny splinter  a remnant  god knows how many weeks and months old 
i discovered   between the vein like heights broken off by the ocean itself   a sort of shore  a few dozen square metres of rather sloping but almost flat surface  and directed the machine there  the landing turned out to be more difficult than i thought it would be  i would have nearly knocked the propeller into the wall growing in front of me  but i managed  i immediately extinguished the engine and threw the dome back  i investigated further  standing on the wing  to see if the helicopter was in danger of sliding into the ocean  the waves licked the toothy edge about a dozen paces from my landing site  but it stood firmly on its widely spaced skids  i jumped down to      the ground   what i had taken before to be the wall i had almost stepped over was a huge  gash like  membrane thin  bony slab  set stiffly  overgrown with galley like thickenings  a gap  several metres wide  divided the whole of this several storey plane diagonally  revealing   like its large  irregularly scattered openings   a perspective of depth  i climbed the nearest sloping span of the wall  finding that the suits boots were remarkably grippy and that the suit itself did not impede movement at all  and  finding myself some four storeys above the ocean  facing into the skeletal landscape  it was only now that i was able to encompass it thoroughly with my eyes 
the resemblance to an archaic city half turned into rubble  some exotic moroccan settlement centuries ago  battered by an earthquake or other cataclysm  was startling  i could clearly see the winding  partially buried and debris clogged gullies of the streets  their intricate  steep confluences towards the shore  washed by a smear of foam  the surviving blanks above  the bastions  their outlandish settlements  and in the convex and congealed walls the black openings  similar to crushed windows or fortress outlets  the whole island  leaning heavily to one side  like a half sunken ship  glided ahead in a senseless  unconscious movement  turning very slowly  as evidenced by the apparent movement of the sun in the firmament  raising lazy shadows crawling between the nooks and crannies of the ruins  occasionally a sunbeam would slip out from among them  reaching the spot where i stood  i climbed even higher  risking a lot already  until  from the overhanging and overhanging growths above my head  fine rubble began to fall in streams  falling down  it filled the winding gullies and streets with great clouds of dust  mimoid is not naturally a rock and its resemblance to limestone disappears when you take a splinter in your hand  it is far lighter than pumice stone  fine cellular  it is extremely airy 
i was already so high up that i could feel its movement  not only did it swim ahead  pushed by the thrusts of the oceans black muscles  from no one knows where  to no one knows where  but it also tilted  once to one side and once to the other  extraordinarily slowly  each of these pendulous wobbles accompanied by the draughty  viscous hum of burly and yellow foam dripping from the emergent edge  this swaying motion had been imparted to it a very long time ago  probably at birth  preserved by its enormous mass  having watched from my aerial position as much as i could  i carefully glided down  and it was only then   a strange thing   that i realised that the mimoid did not interest me at all  that i had flown here to meet not it but the ocean 
i sat down on the rough  cracked surface  with the helicopter a dozen paces behind me  a black wave crept hard onto the shore  flattening out and losing its colour at the same time  when it receded  trembling threads of slime ran down the edge of the talus  i slipped even lower and reached out towards the next one  it then faithfully repeated that phenomenon  first experienced by humans almost a century ago  it hesitated  retreated  poured over my hand without touching it  so that a thin layer of air remained between the surface of the glove and the inside of the hollow  which immediately changed consistency  becoming from liquid almost fleshy  i then raised my hand slowly  the wave  or rather a narrow spur of it  followed it upwards  still surrounding my hand with an increasingly luminous  dirty greenish plume  i stood up  because otherwise i could not raise my hand higher  the isthmus of gelatinous substance tightened like a flailing string  but did not break  the base of the completely flattened wave  like a strange creature patiently awaiting the end of this experience  clung to the shore around my feet  without touching them either   it was as if a malleable flower had sprung from the ocean  its calyx encircling my toes  becoming the exact  though not touching  negative of them  i stepped back  the stem trembled and  as if reluctantly  came back down  flexible  shaky  unsteady  a wave surged pulling it into itself and it disappeared over the edge of the shore  i repeated this game until  again as a century ago  one wave indifferently drifted away  as if satiated by a new sensation  and i knew that i would have to wait several hours for her  curiosity  to awaken  i sat up as before  but as if transformed by this  from theory  so familiar a phenomenon i had evoked  theory could not  could not  convey the real experience 
in the budding  growth  spread of this vivarium  in each of its movements separately and in all of them at once  there was manifested a kind of   one would like to say   cautious but not timid naivety  when it tried to memorise and quickly get to know  to embrace a new  unexpectedly met shape  and halfway had to retreat  when it threatened to cross the mysteriously established limits  how indescribably this agile curiosity contrasted with the vastness that reached out in the splendour of all horizons  never before had i felt such an immense presence of it  a strong  absolute silence  breathing steadily in waves  stunned  stupefied  i descended into seemingly inaccessible regions of inertia and  in the increasing intensity of the obliteration  united myself with this liquid  blind colossus  as if  without the slightest effort  without words  without a single thought  i forgave it everything 
i had behaved so sensibly throughout the past week that the distrustful gleam of  s eyes had finally ceased to haunt me  outwardly i was calm  secretly without realising it clearly  i was expecting something  what  her return  how could i  each of us knows that we are material beings  subject to the laws of physiology and physics  and that the force of all our feelings put together cannot fight these laws  can only hate them  the eternal belief of lovers and poets in the power of love  which is more lasting than death  this finis vitae sed non amoris pursuing us through the ages  is a lie  but this lie is only futile  not ridiculous  to be  on the other hand  a clock that measures the passage of time  alternately shattered and reassembled  in whose mechanism  when the constructor pushes the cogs  despair and love begin to follow with their first movement  to know that one is a repetition of an ordeal  all the more profound the more comical it becomes through the multitude of repetitions  to repeat a human existence  fine  but to repeat it as a drunkard repeats a cliched melody  dropping ever new coppers into the depths of a jukebox  not even for a moment did i believe that this liquid colossus  who has condemned many hundreds of people to death within himself  with whom my entire race has tried in vain for decades to establish even a thread of understanding  that he  floating me involuntarily like a grain of gunpowder  would be moved by the tragedy of two people  but his actions were directed towards some goal  true  even that i was not quite sure  to leave  however  meant to cross out this  perhaps faint  perhaps in the imagination only existing chance that the future concealed  and so the years among the equipment  the things we had touched together  in the air that still remembered her breath  in the name of what  the hope of her return  i had no hope  but an expectation lived in me  the last thing i had left of her  what fulfilment  what derision  what torment did i still expect  i knew nothing abiding in the unshakeable faith that the time of cruel miracles had not passed
