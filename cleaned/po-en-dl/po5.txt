I carried out the calculations with a sort of silent fierceness and it only kept me on my feet  I was so dazed with fatigue that I was unable to unfold the bed in the cabin  and instead of releasing the upper handles  I pulled at the railing until all the bedding had collapsed on me  when I finally lowered it  I dropped my clothes and underwear to the floor  then half conscious  I collapsed on the pillow  I did not even stretch it properly  I fell asleep by the light without knowing when  Opening my eyes  I had the impression that I had barely slept a few minutes  The room stood in a cloudy red glow  I was cool and comfortable  I was lying naked  not covered by anything  Opposite the bed  under the window  which was half uncovered  someone was sitting in a chair in the light of the red sun  It was Harey  in a white beachwear  her leg folded over her leg  barefoot  her dark hair combed back  the thin material stretched tautly over her breasts  her elbow length tanned arms lowered and looking at me fixedly from under her black lashes  I stared at her for a long time  quite still  My first thought was   how good it is that this is the kind of dream in which one knows one is dreaming   Nevertheless  I would have preferred her to disappear  I closed my eyes and began to wish very intensely  but when I opened them she was sitting as she had been before  Her lips were folded in her own way  as if to whistle  but there was nothing of the u smile in her eyes  I recalled all that I had thought about dreaming the previous evening  before falling asleep  She looked exactly the same as when I had last seen her alive  and she was  after all  nineteen then  she would have to be twenty nine now  but naturally nothing had changed   the dead stay young  She had the same wondering eyes about everything and she was looking at me  Ill throw something at her  I thought  but even though it was only a dream  I somehow couldnt bring myself   even in a dream   to hurl things at the dead woman 
  Poor little thing  I said  you came to visit me  didnt you 
I shuddered a little  for my voice sounded so real  and the whole room and Harey   everything presented itself as real as one could imagine 
What a malleable dream  little that is colourful  I see a lot of things here on the floor that I didnt even notice yesterday when lying down  When I wake up  I thought  Ill have to see if theyre really lying here  or if theyre just the product of a dream like Harey    
  Are you going to sit like this for long       I asked and noticed that I was speaking quietly  as if I was afraid someone would hear me  as if anyone could overhear what was going on in the dream  Meanwhile  the sun had already risen a little  Well  I thought  good thing too  I lay down during a red day  then it should be blue  and then only a second red day 
Since I couldnt sleep for fifteen hours non stop  this is definitely sleep  Reassured  I took a good look at Harey  She was illuminated from behind  a ray passing through a gap in the curtain gilded the velvet tinsel on her left cheek  and her eyelashes cast a long shadow over her face  She was lovely  Please  I thought  how meticulous I am even out of waking life  and the movement of the sun I watch for  and that she should have that hole of hers where no one else has it  lower down the corner of her puzzled lips  but I would rather it were over after all  I have to get on with some work  after all  And I clenched my eyelids  trying to wake up  when at once I heard a creak  I immediately opened my eyes  She was sitting next to me on the bed and looking at me with seriousness  I smiled at her and she smiled back  and leaned over me  our first kiss was light  as if we were two children  I kissed her for a long time  Is it possible to exploit a dream like this    I thought  But  after all  this is not even a betrayal of her memory  for it is she who dreams to me  herself  This has never happened to me before     We still said nothing  I lay on my back  when she lifted her face  I could look into her small  sunlit snores from the window  which were always the barometer of her feelings  with my fingertips I wrapped my fingers around her ear conchs  whose petals had turned pink from kisses  I dont know if this disturbed me so much  I kept telling myself it was a dream  but my heart was racing 
I gathered myself to jump out of bed  I was prepared to fail  in a dream one is very often not in control of ones own body  which is as if paralysed or absent  I rather hoped to wake up from this intention  However  I didnt wake up  I just sat up with my feet pushed down to the floor  No way  Ive got to see this through to the end  I thought  but the good mood faded away without a trace  I was afraid 
  What do you want    I asked  My voice was hoarse and I had to grunt 
Instinctively  I looked with my bare feet for my slippers and before I remembered that I didnt have any slippers here  I hit my toe so hard that I hissed  Well  now it will be over    I thought with satisfaction 
But still nothing happened  Harey stepped back as I sat down  Her back was leaning against the bed rail  Her dress vibrated gently just below the apex of her left breast  to the beat of her heart  She watched me with quiet interest  I thought the best thing to do would be to take a shower  the reflection came  however  that a dreaming shower cannot wake one up after all 
  Where did you come from    I asked 
She lifted my hand and began tossing it with the old gesture  tapping my fingertips and grasping them 
  I dont know  she said  is that bad 
And the voice was the same  low  and the tone disjointed  She always spoke as if she didnt really care about the words she spoke  as if she was already preoccupied with something else  which sometimes made her seem thoughtless  and sometimes shameless  because she looked at everything with a dim astonishment that only manifested itself in her eyes 
  Has     has anyone seen you 
  I dont know  I just came  Does it matter  Kris 
She was still playing with my hand  but her face was no longer involved  She clouded over    Harey    
  What  nice 
  How did you know where I was 
This got her thinking  She showed the tips of her teeth in a smile   her lips were so dark you couldnt tell when she was eating cherries 
  I have no idea  Its funny  isnt it  You were asleep when I came in  but I didnt wake you up  I didnt want to wake you because youre a mischief maker  A mischief maker and a bore   she threw up my hand more vigorously in the tact of these words 
  Were you downstairs 
  I was  I ran away from there  its cold down there 
She let go of my hand  Laying down sideways  she threw her head back so that all her hair was to one side  and looked at me with that half smile that only then stopped teasing me when I loved her 
  After all    Harey    after all      I mumbled 
I leaned over her and lifted the short sleeve of her dress  Just above the flower like smallpox vaccination mark was reddening a tiny puncture mark  Although I had expected it  because I was still quite reflexively looking for shreds of logic in the impossible    it made me queasy  I touched my finger to this injection wound  which I then dreamt for years that I would wake up groaning on the shredded bedclothes  always in the same pose  shrunken almost in two  just as she was lying down when I found her almost cold   because I tried to do the same as her in the dream  as if I wanted to propitiate her memory in this way or to accompany her in those last minutes when she had already felt the effect of the injection and must have been afraid  After all  she was afraid of even a simple cut  she could never bear the pain or the sight of blood  and all at once she did such a terrible thing  having left five words on a card addressed to me  I had it in my papers  I carried it with me constantly  worn out  crumbling along the folds  I didnt dare part with it   I went back a thousand times to the moment she wrote it  and to what she must have felt then  I told myself that she just wanted to do it for the sake of it and scare me  and only the dose turned out   unintentionally   to be too much  everyone convinced me that it was  or that it must have been a decision of the moment  caused by depression  sudden depression  What they didnt know  however  was what I had told her five days before and so  to placate her most acutely  I took things away and she  as I was packing  said remarkably calmly   Do you know what this means        and I pretended not to understand  although I understood perfectly  but I had her for a coward  and I told her that too   and now she was lying across the bed and looking at me intently  as if she didnt know I had killed her 
  Cant you do anything else    she asked  The room was red from the sun  there was a dawn smouldering in her hair  she looked at her own arm  made important at once by the fact that I had watched it for so long  and when I lowered my hand she laid a cool  smooth cheek on it 
  Harey  I croaked out  this cant be      Stop it 
Her eyes were closed  I could see them twitching under her tense eyelids  her black lashes touching her cheeks 
  Where are we  Harey 
  At our place 
  Where is it 
Her eye opened for a blink and immediately closed  She tickled my hand with her eyelashes    Kris 
  What 
  Good for me 
I sat over her  not moving  I lifted my head and saw part of the bed  Hareys dishevelled hair and my bare knees in the mirror above the washbasin  I trailed my foot over one of the half melted tools that clattered on the floor and picked it up with my free hand  The end was sharp  I applied it to the skin  just above where the half circle symmetrical scar was pinking up  and drove it into the flesh  The pain was severe  I looked at the dripping blood  which rolled in large drops down the inner surface of my thigh and dripped silently onto the floor 
It was futile  The horrible thoughts that were going through my head were becoming clearer and clearer  I was no longer saying to myself  this is a dream   I had long since stopped believing it  I was now thinking  I have to defend myself   I looked at her back  transitioning under the white material to the curve of her hips  her bare feet hung over the floor  I reached towards them  lightly grasped her pink heel and ran my fingers over the sole of her foot  It was as soft as a newborn babys 
I knew virtually for certain by now that it wasnt Harey   and almost entirely   that she herself didnt know it 
The bare foot moved in my hand  Hareys dark lips swelling with laughter without issuing a voice 
  Stop      she whispered 
I gently ejected my hand and stood up  I was still naked  Dressing hastily  I saw her sit down on the bed  She looked at me 
  Where are your things    I asked and immediately regretted it 
  My things 
  What  you only have this dress 
It was a game now  I tried to act deliberately nonchalant  ordinary  as if we had parted yesterday  no  as if we had never parted at all  She stood up and  in a familiar light yet powerful motion  fluttered her skirt to straighten it  My words intrigued her  though she said nothing  She took in her surroundings with a searching  matter of fact gaze for the first time  and came back to me clearly puzzled 
  I dont know      She said helplessly   I think it was in the wardrobe       She added and swung the door open 
  No  there are only overalls in there   I replied  I found an electric apparatus next to the washroom and started to shave  I preferred not to stand with my back to the girl  whoever she was  She walked around the cabin  looked in all the corners  looked out of the window  finally approached me and said 
  Kris  I have this feeling  as if something happened 
She broke off  I waited with the camera off in my hand 
  As if I had forgotten something    Like Ive forgotten a lot  I know    I only remember you    i    and nothing else 
I listened to this  trying to control my own face 
  Was I    sick 
  Well    you could call it that  Yes  you were a bit sick for a while 
  Aha  That must be from that 
Shes already mellowed out  I cant tell you what I was experiencing  When she was silent  walking  sitting  smiling  the conviction that I had Harey in front of me was stronger than my nauseating trepidation  then again  as at that very moment  it seemed to me that this was Harey simplified  narrowed down to a few characteristic proclamations  gestures  movements  She came quite close to me  drove her muffled fists into my breasts below my neck and asked 
  How are things with us  Good or bad 
  As well as can be expected   I replied  She smiled slightly 
  When you say it like that  its rather bad 
  But no  Harey  darling  I must leave now  I said hastily    Youll wait for me  wont you  Or maybe    are you hungry    I added  as I myself felt a growing hunger at once 
  Hungry  No 
She shook her head until her hair waved 
  Should I wait for you  How long 
  An hour   I started  but she interrupted me 
  Ill go with you 
  You cant come with me because I have to work 
  Ill come with you 
It was a completely different Harey  that one didnt impose  Never 
  Child  its impossible   
She looked down at me  at once she took my hand  I ran my hand along her forearm upwards  her arm was full and warm  I didnt want it at all  but it was almost a caress  My body was acknowledging her  wanting her  pulling me to her beyond reason  beyond argument and fear 
Trying to remain calm at all costs  I repeated    Harey  this is impossible  you must stay here 
  No 
How it sounded 
  Why 
  N    I dont know 
She looked around and raised her eyes at me again 
  I cant      she said quite quietly 
  But why 
  I dont know  I cant  It seems to me    I think   
She was clearly searching within herself for the answer  and when she found it  it was a revelation    I seem to have to keep    see  The matter of fact intonation took away the sense of a confession of feelings from these words  it was something else entirely  Under such an impression  the grip with which I was girding her suddenly changed   although externally nothing had changed   she was standing in my embrace  looking into her eyes  I began to bend her arms backwards  this movement  at first not completely determined  was already leading somewhere   it had found its purpose  I was already searching with my eyes for something with which I could bind her 
Her elbows  twisted backwards  clattered lightly against each other and at the same time sprang up with a force that made my grip futile  I struggled for perhaps a second  Even an athlete  bent over backwards like Harey  barely touching the floor with the tips of his feet  would not have managed to extricate himself  but she  with a face that took no part in it all  a weak  uncertain smile  broke my grip  straightened up and lowered her arms 
Her eyes watched me with the same calm interest as at the very beginning when I awoke  as if she was unaware of my desperate effort a moment ago  dictated by an attack of trepidation  She now stood passively and waited as if for something   at once indifferent  focused and a little puzzled by it all 
My hands dropped of their own accord  I left her in the middle of the room and walked to the shelf by the washroom  I felt that I was caught in an unimaginable trap  and I looked for a way out  considering ways that were increasingly ruthless  If someone had asked me what was happening to me and what it all meant  I wouldnt have been able to say a word  but I was already aware that what was happening to all of us at the Station was a whole  as horrible as it was incomprehensible  but that wasnt what I was thinking about at the moment  because I was trying to invent a trick  a stroke to escape  Without looking  I felt Hareys gaze on me  Above the shelf was a small first aid kit in the wall  I cursorily looked through its contents  I found a jar of sleeping powders and dropped four tablets   the maximum dose   into a glass  I didnt even really hide my manipulations from Harey  Its hard to say why  I didnt really think about it  I poured hot water into the glass  waited for the powders to dissolve  and approached Harey still standing in the middle of the room 
  Are you angry    She asked quietly 
  No  Drink this 
I dont know why I assumed she would listen to me  Indeed  without a word she took the glass from my hands and drank the entire contents in a choke  I set the empty glass down on the coffee table and sat down in the corner between the cupboard and the library shelf  Harey approached me slowly and sat down on the floor by the armchair  as she sometimes did  curling her legs underneath her  and tossed her hair back in the same familiar motion  Although I no longer believed it was her at all  every time I recognised her in these little habits  something gripped my throat  It was incomprehensible and awful  and the most awful thing of all was that I too had to behave perversely  pretending to take her for Harey  but after all  she supposed herself to be Harey and was not acting in her understanding deceitfully  I dont know how I came to believe that this was the case  but it was certain to me  if there could still be anything certain at all 
I sat and the girl leaned with her back against my knees  her hair tickling my still hand  we continued like this almost motionless  I glanced slightly at my watch a couple of times  Half an hour had passed and the sleeping agent should have worked by now  Harey muttered something quietly    What are you saying    I asked  but she did not answer  I took this as a sign of increasing drowsiness  although God and truth in the depths of my soul I doubted whether the remedy would work  Why  And I cant find an answer to this question  most likely because my ploy was already too simple 
Slowly her head settled into my lap  her dark hair covered her completely  she breathed steadily like a sleeping person  I bent down to move her onto the bed  at once  without opening her eyes  she grabbed me lightly by the hair with her hand and burst out laughing sharply 
I was numb  and she was bursting with hilarity  With her eyes squinted into slits  she watched me with a face that was both naive and sly  I sat unnaturally stiff  stunned and helpless  and Harey giggled once more  hugged her face to my hand and fell silent 
  Why are you laughing    I asked in a wooden voice  The same expression of slightly anxious wonder appeared on her face  I could see that she wanted to be reliable  She tapped her little nose with her finger and finally said with a sigh 
  I dont know myself 
She sounded genuinely surprised 
  Im acting like an idiot  right    she picked up    Its just that all at once Im    but youre good  too  youre sitting there puffed up like    like Pelvis   
  Like who    I asked  because I thought I had misheard 
  Like Pelvis  after all  you know  that gru by    
Well  Harey beyond all doubt could not have known Pelvis or heard of him from me for the simple reason that he returned from his expedition a good three years after her death  I also did not know him until then  and I did not know that  when presiding over meetings of the Institute  he had an unbearable habit of dragging meetings out indefinitely  His name  by the way  was Pelle Villis  which gave rise to an abbreviated nickname  also unknown before his return 
Harey rested her elbows on my knees and looked me in the face  I put my hands on her shoulders and moved them slowly up to her shoulders until they came together almost on the throbbing  naked settlement of her neck  It could have been a caress in the end and  judging from her gaze  she didnt understand it otherwise  In fact  I was convincing myself that her body was  under touch  ordinary  warm human flesh  and that beneath the muscles were bones and joints  Looking into her calm eyes  I felt a terrible urge to clench my fingers violently 
They were almost closing in on me when at once I remembered Snau tas bloody hands  and I let her go 
  As you watch      she said calmly 
My heart was pounding so much that I was unable to speak  I closed my eyelids for a moment 
Suddenly the whole plan of action appeared to me  from beginning to end  with all the details  Without missing a beat  I got up from my chair    I have to go now  Harey  I said  and if you absolutely want to  come with me 
  Good 
She jumped on her equal feet 
  Why are you barefoot    I asked  walking over to the wardrobe and choosing two out of the colourful overalls  for myself and for her 
  I dont know    I must have dropped my boots somewhere       she said uncertainly  I let it go by the ears 
  You wont wear that in a dress  youll have to throw it off 
  A jumpsuit     what for    she asked  getting straight down to pulling on the dress  but immediately found something strange  that it was impossible to take it off because it had no fastening 
The red buttons in the middle were decorative  Any kind of zip  zipper or otherwise  was missing  Harey smiled confusedly  Pretending it was the most ordinary thing in the world  with a scalpel like instrument raised from the ground  I incised the fabric where the back neckline ended  Now she could pull the dress over her head  The suit was a little too bulky for her 
  Shall we fly     But you too    she asked when  both of us already dressed  we left the room  I only nodded  I was terribly afraid that we would meet Snaut  but the corridor leading to the airport was empty and the door of the radio station we had to pass was closed 
There was still a dead silence on the Station Harey watched as I rolled the rocket out of the middle cubicle on a slow track with a small electric cart  I checked in turn the condition of the microreactor  the remotely operated rudders and the nozzles  then together with the launch trolley I rolled the missile onto the circular roll plane of the launch shield under the central dome funnel  having first removed the empty tray from there 
This was a stateroom used to maintain communications between the Station and the Sateloid  used to carry cargo  not people  probably in exceptional cases  as it could not be opened from the inside  Thats what I had in mind and was part of the plan  I wasnt going to launch the rocket naturally  but I was doing everything as if I was preparing it for a real launch  Harey  who had accompanied me on my travels so many times  knew a bit about it  I checked the condition of the air conditioning and oxygen apparatus still inside  started one and the other  and when the lights came on when the main circuit was switched on  I peered out of the cramped interior and pointed it out to Harey  who was standing at the ladder 
  Go inside 
  And you 
  Ill go in after you  I have to close the trapdoor behind us 
It didnt seem to me that she could see through the ruse prematurely  When she climbed the ladder inside  I immediately stuck my head through the opening and asked if she could make herself comfortable  and when I heard a deafening  yes   stifled by the tightness of the space  I stepped back and slammed the flap shut with a flourish  In two motions I threw the two bolts as far as they would go and  with a prepared spanner  began to tighten the five mounting bolts in the armour grooves 
The sharpened cigar stood upright  as if it were actually going to fly into space in a moment  I knew that nothing bad would happen to the one locked in it   there was plenty of oxygen and even some food in the rocket  and I had no intention of imprisoning it there indefinitely  I wanted at all costs to gain at least a few hours of freedom to make plans for the future and to contact Snaut  now on an equal footing 
As I tightened the penultimate bolt  I felt the metal braces holding the rocket  suspended only by protrusions on three sides  tremble slightly  but I thought that it was I myself  working with the momentum of a large spanner  that had inadvertently shaken the steel lump 
However  when I took a few steps away  I saw something I would not like to see again 
The whole rocket was panting  tossed by a series of blows falling from within  but what blows  If the place of the black haired  slender girl had been taken by a steel automaton in the craft  surely it would not have been able to put the eight ton mass into such a convulsive panting 
The reflections of the airport lights in its polished surface shimmered and trembled  No thumps  moreover  could be heard  there was absolute silence inside the missile  only the widely spaced feet of the scaffolding in which the rocket hung lost the sharpness of their drawing  jittering like strings  The frequency of these vibrations was such that I was frightened for all the armour 
I tightened the last bolt with shaking hands  hurled the spanner and jumped off the ladder  Retreating slowly backwards  I saw the bolts of the shock absorbers  calculated only to apply constant pressure  dance in their casts  It seemed to me that the armoured shell was losing its uniform sheen  Like a madman  I jumped to the remote control panel  pushed up the reactor start up and communications lever with both hands  then  from the loudspeaker  which was connected to the interior of the rocket  boomed a wheezing  neither a hiss nor a swish  completely unlike a human voice  and yet I distinguished in it a repeated  howling  Kris  Kris  Kris     I did not hear it clearly  anyway  Blood was pouring from my shattered ankles  so chaotic and violent was my attempt to launch the missile  A bluish dawn rained down on the walls  clouds of dust erupted from the launch shield beneath the outlets  turned into a column of venomous sparks and all sounds were covered by a high  protracted rumble  The rocket rose on three flames  which instantly merged into a single column of fire  and  leaving billowing patches of embers behind  flew out through the open launcher  The apertures immediately closed it  automatically activated compressors began to flush the hall with fresh air as the biting smoke billowed out  I was unaware of all this  Leaning with my hands against the desktop  with my face still burning with a living fire  my hair twisted and smeared from the thermal impact  I was clutching the air  full of the stench of burning and the ozone like smell of ionisation  Although I closed my eyes reflexively at the moment of take off  the exhaust flame electrocuted me  For a good while all I could see were black  red and golden circles  Slowly they dissipated 
The smoke  dust and mist disappeared  drawn into the draughty groaning ventilation ducts  The first thing I managed to see was the greenishly glowing radar screen  I started looking for the missile  manoeuvring the directional reflector  When I finally caught it  it was already above the atmosphere  I had never launched a missile in my life before in such a crazy and blind way  with no idea what acceleration to give it or where to send it at all  I thought it would be easiest if I put it into a circular orbit around Solaris  at an altitude of a thousand kilometres or so  and then I could shut down the engines  because as long as they were running  I wasnt sure that there wouldnt be some incalculable disaster  The thousand kilometre orbit was   as I had convinced myself from the chart   stationary  And she  in truth  did not guarantee anything  it was simply the only way out I could see 
The loudspeaker  which I turned off immediately after take off  I did not dare turn on  Rather  I would have done I dont know what  as long as I didnt expose myself to hearing that awful voice again  in which there was nothing human anymore  All semblance  I could tell myself  had been stripped away and through the semblance of Hareys face began to peep another  a real one  against which the alternative of madness was indeed becoming liberating 
She was the first to go when I left the airport
