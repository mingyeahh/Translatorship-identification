the skin on my face and hands was burnt  i remembered that while i was looking for a sleeping remedy for harey  i would laugh at my naivety now if i could   i had noticed a jar of anti burn ointment in the medicine cabinet  so i went in myself  i opened the door and  in the red light of the west  saw that someone was sitting in the chair where harey had knelt before  fear paralysed me  i lumbered back panic stricken to throw myself into flight  it lasted a fraction of a second  the sitter raised his head  it was snaut  with his leg over  his back turned to me  he still wore the same reagent burned canvas trousers  he was looking through some papers  a whole bundle of them lay next to him on the coffee table  at the sight of me  he put them all down and stared at me for a moment  grimacing  over his glasses  which were lowered to the end of his nose 
without a word  i went to the washroom  took a semi liquid ointment from the medicine cabinet and began to rub it on the most burned areas of my forehead and cheeks  luckily  i did not swell much  and my eyes survived thanks to the fact that i clamped my eyelids tightly shut  i pricked a few larger blisters on my temple and cheek with a sterile injection needle and squeezed the serous fluid out of them  then i taped two patches of moistened gauze over my face  all the time snaut was watching me intently  i ignored it  when i finally finished these treatments  and my face was burning more and more   i sat down in the second chair  first i had to remove hareys dress from it  it was a perfectly ordinary dress  except for the story with the clasp  which wasnt there 
snaut  with his hands folded over his pointy knee  followed my movements critically 
  well  how about we have a chat    he spoke up when i sat down 
i didnt answer  squeezing the flap of gauze that had begun to slip down my cheek 
  we had visitors  didnt we 
  yes   i replied dryly  i didnt have the slightest desire to tune into his tone 
  and we got rid of  well  well  you took to it impetuously 
he touched the still flaky skin on his forehead  pink patches of fresh skin were showing on it  i stared at them with ba  hurt  why hadnt the so called tan of snaut and sartorius given me a thought so far  all this time i thought it was from the sun   and yet nobody gets a tan on solaris    
  but you started modestly  i suppose    he said  ignoring the flash of sudden understanding that enlightened me    all sorts of things there  narcoti ca  venena  free american   what 
  what do you want  we can talk on equal terms  if you want to clown around  youd better go 
  sometimes you are a clown in spite of yourself  he said  he raised his squinted eyes at me 
  youre not going to tell me that you didnt use a rope or a hammer  and didnt you sometimes hurl an inkwell like luther  no  hey   he croaked   youre a real braggart  you didnt even try to smash your head  you didnt even demolish your room  you just  like that  just like that  you packed it  shot it  and were even 
he looked at his watch 
  we should have had about two or three hours   he concluded  he looked at me  looked at me with an unpleasant smile  until he decided 
  so you say you consider me a pig 
  a complete pig   i affirmed emphatically 
  yes  would you believe it if i told you  would you believe a word of it 
i remained silent 
  it happened to gibarian first   he continued  still with that fake smile    he locked himself in his cabin and only talked through the door  and we  do you think  what did we adjudicate  i knew  but i preferred to remain silent 
  well  of course  we decided he was crazy  he told us something through the door  but not everything  do you even have any idea why he concealed who was with him  well  you already know  suum cuiaue  but he was a real researcher  he demanded that we give him a chance 
  what chance 
  well  he was trying  i suppose  to classify it somehow  to get to grips with it  to settle it  to work through the night  do you know what he was doing  you certainly do 
  these calculations   i said    in a drawer  in the radio station  is that him 
  yes  but i didnt know anything about it at the time 
  how long did it last 
  a visitor  a week  i think  talking through the door  well  what was going on there  we thought he was hallucinating and being motor stimulated  i was giving him scopolamine 
  what do you mean    him  
  well  yes  he was taking it  but not for himself  he was experimenting  thats how it went 
   and you    
  us  on the third day we decided to get to him  to break down the door  if nothing else  out of nobility we wanted to treat him 
  a    thats why    i snapped out of it 
  yes
  and there    in that wardrobe   
  yes  dear boy  yes  he didnt know that in the meantime  we were haunted by visitors too  and we couldnt look after him any more  he didnt know that  now this    its a certain    routine  he said it so quietly that i guessed the last word rather than heard it    wait  i dont understand   i said    so what  you must have heard  you said yourself that you were eavesdropping  you must have heard two voices  so   
  no  just his voice  and even if there were unintelligible murmurs  i think you understand that we attributed them all to him    
  just his     but    why 
  i dont know  i have  admittedly  a theory about it  but i think its not worth rushing into it  especially as explaining this and that doesnt help  yes  but you must have seen something already yesterday  otherwise you would have taken us both for crazy 
  i thought i was crazy myself 
  oh  yeah  and you didnt see anyone 
  i did 
  who 
his grimace was no longer a smile  i looked at him for a long time before i answered 
  that    black   
he did not speak  but his whole shrunken and leaning forward body relaxed slightly 
  you could have warned me  though  i began  already with less conviction 
  i did warn you after all 
  in what way 
  the only way possible  understand  i did not know who it would be  nobody knew that  you cant know that   
  listen  snaut  a few questions  youve known this    for some time  is this    is    whats going to happen to her 
  you mean  is she going to come back 
  yes 
  shell come back and she wont 
  what does that mean 
  shell come back as she was at the beginning    the first visit  she will simply not know anything  or  to be strict  she will act as if all the things youve pulled to get rid of her never happened  if you dont force her with a situation  she wont be aggressive      what situation 
  it depends on the circumstances 
  snaut 
  what do you mean 
  we cannot afford the luxury of concealment 
  its not a luxury   he interrupted me dryly    kelvin  i get the feeling that you still dont understand      or  wait 
his eyes shone 
  can you tell who was here 
i swallowed my saliva  i lowered my head  i didnt want to look at him  i would have preferred it to be someone else  not him  but i had no choice  a patch of gauze peeled away and fell onto my hand  i shuddered from the slippery touch 
  the woman i    i didnt finish 
  she had killed herself  she made herself    injected    waited 
  she committed suicide       he asked  seeing that i was silent 
  yes 
  is that all  i remained silent 
  that cant be all    i raised my head quickly  he wasnt looking at me 
  how do you know  he didnt answer 
  good   i said  i licked my lips    we had an argument  or actually we didnt  i was the one who told her  you know  how one speaks in anger  i took my mannequins and moved out  she let me know  she didnt say it directly  but when you live with someone for years  you dont need it     i was sure she was just saying that   that she would have been afraid to do it and it i told her too  the other day i remembered that i had left those injections  she knew about them   i had brought them from the lab  i needed them   i told her then what the effect was  i got scared and wanted to go and get them  but then i thought it would look like i took her words seriously  and i i left it at that  but on the third day however i went  it didnt give me a break  already    when i came  she was already dead 
  ah  you innocent boy    
it made me tear up  but when i looked at him  i realised he wasnt mocking  i saw him as if for the first time  his face was grey  unspeakable fatigue lay in the deep furrows of his cheeks  he looked like a man who was seriously ill 
  why do you say that    i asked  strangely intimidated 
  because the story is tragic  no  no   he added quickly  seeing that i had moved   you still dont understand  of course  you can take it the hardest  even have yourself killed  but     thats not the worst of it 
  what are you saying    i said derisively 
  im glad you dont believe me  really  what happened may be terrible  but the scariest thing is what didnt happen     didnt happen  it never did 
  i dont understand      i said weakly  i really didnt understand anything  he nodded his head    a normal man  he said    what is a normal man  one who has never committed anything heinous  yes  but did he never think about it  or maybe he didnt even think about it  only something in him thought about it  grew up  ten or thirty years ago  maybe he defended himself against it and forgot it  and didnt fear it because he knew he would never put it into action  yes  and now imagine that at once  in a full day  among other people  he meets to embodied  chained to himself  indestructible  what then  what do you have then  i was silent 
  a station  he said quietly    you then have the solaris station 
  but    what could it be in the end    i said hesitantly   you are not  after all  a criminal or a sartorius    
  but you are a psychologist after all  kelvin    he interrupted me impatiently    who hasnt had a dream like that before  a swarming dream  think of    of a fetishist who has fallen in love with  i dont know  a piece of dirty underwear  who  risking his skin  acquires by threat and request his dearest  loathsome rag  it must be funny  huh  who at the same time abhors the object of his lust and goes mad for it and is prepared to risk his life for it to match  perhaps  romeos feelings for juliet     such things do happen  true  but you probably understand that there must also be things      situations    such that no one has dared to realise them  except in their own mind  in some single moment of bewilderment  collapse  madness  call it what you will  after which the word becomes flesh 
thats it 
  thats    all   i repeated senselessly  in a wooden voice  there was a rumble in my head    but  but the station  what has the station got to do with it 
  you must be pretending   he muttered  he looked at me investigatively    after all  im still talking about solaris  only solaris  nothing else  not my fault if its so drastically different from your expectations 
besides  youve been through enough to at least hear me out to the end 
we set off into space  prepared for everything  that is  for loneliness  for struggle  martyrdom and death  out of modesty  we dont say it out loud  but we sometimes think to ourselves that we are great  meanwhile  in the meantime  this is not all  and our readiness turns out to be a pose  we do not want to conquer the cosmos at all  we only want to extend the earth to its limits  some planets are to be desert like the sahara  others icy like the pole or tropical like the brazilian jungle  we are humane and noble  we do not want to conquer other races  we just want to pass on our values to them and take over their heritage in return  we think of ourselves as knights of the sacred contact  this is the second falsehood  we are not looking for anyone but humans  we do not need other worlds  we need mirrors  we dont know what to do with other worlds  all we need is this one  and we are already choking on it  we want to find our own idealised image  these are supposed to be globs  civilisations more perfect than ours  in others we expect to find again the image of our primitive past  meanwhile  on the other side there is something we do not accept  something we defend ourselves against  and yet we did not bring from earth a mere distillate of virtues  a heroic statue of man  we came here as we really are  and when the other side shows us this truth   the part of it that we are silent about   we cannot accept it 
  so what is it    i asked  having listened to him patiently 
  what we wanted  contact with another civilisation  we have it  this contact  exaggerated as if under a microscope  our own monstrous ugliness  our clownishness and shame    
there was a trembling rage in his voice 
  do you think  then  that it is     ocean  that it is him  but why  never mind the mechanism at the moment  but for gods sake  what for  do you seriously think it wants to play with us  or to punish us  this is just primitive demonology  a planet overrun by a very great devil who  to satisfy his vein of satanic humour  suggests succubi to the members of a scientific expedition  you yourself probably dont believe such finite idiocy 
  this devil is not so stupid at all   he muttered through his teeth  i looked at him surprised 
it occurred to me that he might have finally had a nervous breakdown  even if what was happening at the station was not explained by madness  reactive psychosis       it still flashed through my mind when  with almost no voice  he began to laugh quietly 
  are you giving me a diagnosis  wait a bit longer  in fact  you experienced it in such a mild form that you still dont know anything 
  aha  the devil took pity on me   i chuckled  the conversation was beginning to bore me 
  what do you actually want  to tell you what plans x trillion metamorphic plasma are plotting against us  perhaps none 
  what do you mean  none    i asked stunned  snaut was still smiling 
  you should know that science is only concerned with how things happen  not why things happen  how  well  it started eight or nine days after that x ray experiment  maybe the ocean responded to the radiation with some other radiation  maybe it probed our brains with it and brought out some psychic torpor 
  otorments 
that started to interest me 
  well  yes  processes detached from  locked away  repressed  walled off  some inflammatory foci of memory  he treated them as a prescription  as a construction plan     after all  you know how similar are the asymmetrical crystals of chromosomes and those nucleic connections of cerebrosides that are the substrate of memory processes     hereditary plasma is  after all  remembering plasma  so it took it out of us  annotated it  and then  you know  what happened next  but why was this done  bal in any case  not to destroy us  that would have come much easier to him  in general  with such technological freedom  he could have done almost anything  for example set up doubles for us 
  thats why you were so frightened the first night i came    yes  anyway  he added  maybe he did  how do you know if i am really the kindly old rat who came here two years ago    
he began to laugh quietly  as if my stupor gave him god knows what satisfaction  but stopped immediately 
  no  no  he muttered  and without that its quite     maybe there are more differences  but i only know one  me with you can be killed 
  and them not 
  i dont advise you to try  a terrible spectacle 
  nothing 
  i dont know  in any case  not with poison  knife  stryk    
  an atomic thrower 
  would you try it 
  i dont know  if you know theyre not people 
  when they are in a sense  subjectively they are people  they are not at all aware of their    origin  have you noticed that  i think 
  yes  so    whats it like 
  they regenerate at an unheard of rate  at an impossible rate  right in front of your eyes  i tell you  and they start acting all over again like     like   
  like what 
  like our ideas about them  those memory records according to which    
  yes  thats right   i fixed it  i didnt mind the ointment running down my burnt cheeks and dripping onto my hands 
  did gibarian know       i asked suddenly  he looked at me carefully 
  did he know what we knew 
  yes 
  almost certainly 
  how do you know  did he tell you 
  no  but i found a certain book at his place    
   the little apocrypha     i exclaimed  picking myself up from my seat 
  yes  and how can you know about it    he asked with sudden concern  plunging his pupils into my face  i made a contradictory movement with my head 
  relax  i said    you can see  after all  that i am burned and not regenerating at all  there was a letter for me in the cabin 
  what are you saying  a letter  what was in it 
  not much  actually a note  not a letter  a bibliographical reference to the solarian appendix  to this  apocrypha   what is it 
  an old thing  possibly has something to do with it  here 
he pulled a leather bound  corner worn  thin volume out of his pocket and handed it to me 
  and sartorius       i chuckled while hiding the book 
  what sartorius  everyone behaves in such a situation as      he can  he tries to be normal   with him that means official 
  well  you know 
  but yes  i was in a situation with him once  less about the details  enough that we were left with eight five hundred kilos of oxygen  one by one we dropped our daily activities  by the end we were all walking around bearded  he was the one shaving  cleaning his shoes  hes that kind of man  naturally  whatever he does now will be a pretense  a comedy or a crime 
  crime 
  then not a crime  we need to invent a new word for it  for example  jet divorce  does it sound better 
  you are remarkably witty  i said 
  would you rather i cried  suggest something 
  ah  give me a break 
  no  im serious  you now know more or less as much as i do  do you have a plan 
  youre good  i dont know what im going to do when     he turns up again  he has to turn up 
  rather  yes 
  which way do they actually get in  after all the station is airtight  maybe the armour   
he shook his head negatively 
  the armour is fine  i have no idea how  we usually have visitors when we wake up  and eventually you have to sleep from time to time 
  any closure 
  it helps for a short time  remedies remain  well  you know what they are  he got up  and i got up 
  look here  snaut    youre all about liquidating the station  only you want it to come from me 
he shook his head 
  its not that simple  naturally  we can always escape  if only to the sateloid  and broadcast an sos from there  theyll treat us  its understood  as if were insane   some sort of sanatorium on earth until we call it all off nicely   there are  after all  incidents of collective insanity on such isolated outposts     that wouldnt be the worst thing  perhaps  the garden  the tranquillity  the white rooms  the walks with the nurses    
he spoke quite seriously  with his hands in his pockets  gazing with unseeing eyes into a corner of the room  the red sun had already disappeared behind the horizon and the fringed waves melted into an inked desert  the sky was on fire  lilac edged clouds flowed over this two coloured landscape  indescribably bleak 
  so do you want to run away  or not  not yet  he smiled 
  steadfast conqueror    you havent tasted it yet so you wouldnt insist on it  its not about what i want  its about what is possible 
  what 
  thats what i dont know 
  so we stay here  do you think there will be a middle ground    
he looked at me  scrawny  with the flaky skin of his face riddled with wrinkles 
  who knows  maybe it will pay off  he said at last    were unlikely to find out anything about him  but maybe about us   
he turned  picked up his papers and left  i wanted to stop him  but his open mouth made no sound  there was nothing to be done  i could only wait  i went to the window and looked out at the blood black ocean  almost not seeing it  it occurred to me that i could lock myself in one of the airport rockets  but i didnt think seriously about it  it was too stupid  sooner or later i would have to leave  after all  i sat down by the window and took out the book snaut had given me  the light was still sufficient  it turned the pages pink  the whole room was bitter red  it was   collected by a certain otto ravintzer  master of philosophy   articles and papers of generally unambiguous value  every science is always accompanied by some kind of pseudo science  its bizarre derangement in the minds of a certain type  astronomy has its caricaturist in astrology  chemistry once had one in alchemy  so it is understandable that the birth of solar science was accompanied by a veritable explosion of oddities of thought  ravintzers book was filled with this kind of spiritual nourishment  preceded   it must be loyally added   by an introduction from his pen in which he distanced himself from this panopticon  he simply believed  not without reason  that such a collection could be a valuable document of the times  both for the historian and for the psychologist of science  bertons report occupied a prominent place in the book  it consisted of several parts  the first was a copy of his boarding book  very laconic 
from four oclock to sixteen forty of the expeditions conventional time  the notes were laconic and negative 
altitude 1 000   or 1 200   or 800 metres   nothing observed   ocean empty 
this was repeated several times 
then at 16 40  red fog lifts  visibility 700 metres  ocean empty 
o 17 00  fog thickens  quiet  visibility 400 metres  with clearances  i descend to 200 
at 17 20  i am in the fog  altitude 200  visibility 20 40 metres  quiet  i ascend to 400  17 45  height 500  fog bank to the horizon  in the fog   funnel shaped holes through which the surface of the ocean seeps  something is happening in them  i try to enter one of these funnels 
at 17 52  i see a kind of whirlpool   it throws up yellow foam  surrounded by a wall of fog  height 100 
i descend to 20 
that was the end of bertons log book entry  further down the so called report was an extract from his medical history  or to be more precise  it was the text of a statement dictated by berton and punctuated by questions from committee members 
 berton  when i descended to thirty metres  maintaining altitude became difficult because there were gusty winds in this circular  fog free space  i had to put my weight on the rudders and so i didnt look out of the gondola for a while   maybe 10 or 15 minutes  as a result  i inadvertently entered the fog  carried into it by a strong gust  it wasnt ordinary fog  but a sort of suspension  colloidal  i think  because it sloughed off all my windows  i had a lot of trouble clearing them  it was very sticky  meanwhile  it reduced my revs by thirty odd per cent as a result of the drag that this sort of fog was putting on the propeller  so that i began to lose altitude  as i was very low and feared that i would drift on the wave  i gave full throttle  the machine maintained altitude  but upwards it was not going  i still had four patrons of rocket accelerators  i did not use them with the thought that the situation might get worse and i would need them then  at full speed there was a very strong vibration  i guessed that the propeller was sloshing around with this strange slurry  however  i still had zero on the lift clocks  so there was nothing i could do about it  i hadnt seen the sun since i entered the fog  but it was phosphorescing red in its direction  i kept circling in the hope that eventually i would be able to fall out into one of those fog free areas  and indeed i did  about half an hour later  i flew out into a free space  almost exactly circular  several hundred metres in diameter  its boundary was fog billowing violently  as if lifted by strong convection currents  i therefore tried to stay as much as possible in the centre of the  hole     there the air was calmest  i then noticed a change in the surface of the ocean  the waves disappeared almost completely  and the superficial layer of this liquid   what the ocean is made of   became semi transparent  with smokes that faded away until  after a short time  it was completely clarified and i could look into the depths through a layer that was probably several metres thick  it was as if a yellow slime had accumulated there  which moved upwards in thin  vertical streaks  and when it came to the surface  it became glassy and shiny  began to bubble and foam and thickened  it was then similar to a very thick  burnt sugar syrup  this slime or mucus would gather into thick knots  grow above the surface  form ka lafioroval heights and slowly form various shapes  it began to pull me towards the wall of mist  so i had to parry this movement with turns and rudders for a few minutes  and when i could look out again  down below me  i saw something that resembled a garden  yes  a garden  i saw dwarf trees and hedges  and paths  untrue   all of it made of the same substance that had pretty much solidified like yellowish plaster  thats what it looked like  the surface glistened heavily  i lowered myself as far as i could to inspect it carefully 
question  did those trees and other plants you saw have leaves 
bertons answer  no  it was just this general shape   sort of like a model of a garden  oh  yes  model  thats what it looked like  a model  but probably life size  after a while  everything began to crack and split  a thick mucus squeezed to the surface in waves through the cracks  which were completely black  and solidified  some of it dribbling away and some of it staying  and everything began to agitate more and more vigorously  covered itself in foam and i could no longer see anything but it  at the same time  the fog began to squeeze me from all sides  so i increased the speed and went out to 300 metres 
question  are you absolutely sure that what you saw resembled a garden   and nothing else  bertons answer  yes  thats because i noticed various details there  i remember  for example  that in one place there were square boxes standing in a row  as it were  later it occurred to me that it could have been an apiary 
question  later it occurred to you  but not at the time you saw it 
bertons answer  no  because it was all like a plaster  and i saw other things 
question  what kind of things 
bertons answer  i cant say which ones  because i didnt manage to see them in detail  i got the impression that there were some tools lying under some bushes  they were sub long winded shapes with protruding teeth like plaster casts of small gardening machines  but of this i am not quite sure  that one  yes 
question  didnt you think it was a hallucination 
bertons answer  no  i thought it was a fatamorgan  i didnt think of a hallucination because i felt completely fine  and also because i had never seen anything like it in my life  when i got up to three hundred metres  the fog was riddled with depressions below me  it looked just like cheese  some of these holes were empty and i could see the ocean rippling in them  while in others something was churning  i went down into one such place and at forty metres i saw that beneath the surface of the ocean   but quite shallow   lay a wall  as if the wall of a very large building  it shone brightly through the waves and had rows of regular  rectangular openings  like windows  and it even seemed to me that something was moving in some of the windows  of this i am no longer quite sure  this wall began to slowly rise and emerge from the ocean  it was dripping with mucus in whole waterfalls and some kind of slimy formations  such veined thickening  suddenly it split in two and went into the depths so fast that it disappeared immediately  i pulled the machine up again and flew just above the fog itself  that i was almost touching it with my undercarriage  i saw another empty funnel   it was probably several times bigger than the first one 
already from a distance i saw something floating  it seemed to me  because it was bright  almost white  that it was a fechner suit  especially as the shape resembled a human being  i made a turn with the machine  very abruptly  i was afraid that i might pass the place and not find it again  this figure then rose slightly and it looked as if it were swimming or standing up to its waist in a wave  i was in a hurry and went so low that i felt the impact of the undercarriage against something soft  the crest of a wave  i suppose  as there was a sizeable one at this point  the man  yes  it was a man  was not wearing a wetsuit  nevertheless  he was moving  question  did you see his face  bertons answer  yes  question  who was it  bertons answer  it was a child  question  what kind of child  did you ever see them anywhere in your life 
bertons answer  no  never  at any rate  i dont recall  anyway  as soon as i got closer   i was about forty metres away from it  maybe a bit more   i realised there was something wrong with it  question  what do you mean by that  bertons answer  ill tell you right away  i didnt know what it was at first  only after a while did i realise  it was unusually huge  huge is an understatement  it was perhaps four metres long  i remember exactly that when i hit the undercarriage on the wave  its face was slightly above mine  and even though i was sitting in the cabin  i must have been about three metres above the surface of the ocean 
question  if it was that big  how did you know it was a baby 
bertons answer  because it was a very small child 
question  dont you think  berton  that your answer is illogical 
bertons answer  no  not at all  because i saw his face  and anyway  the proportions of the body were childlike  it looked to me like    almost like a baby  no  thats an exaggeration  maybe it was two or three years old  it had black hair and blue eyes  huge  and it was naked  completely naked  like a newborn  it was  wet  or rather slippery  its skin so shiny 
this sight affected me terribly  i no longer believed in any fatamorgan  i could see it too closely  it was rising and falling according to the movement of the wave  but moving regardless  it was awful 
question  why  what was it doing 
bertons answer  it looked  well  like in some museum  like a doll  but like a living doll 
it opened and closed its mouth and made all sorts of movements  repulsive  yes  because these were not its movements 
question  how do you understand this 
bertons answer  i didnt get more than a dozen metres closer to it  twenty would perhaps be the most appropriate assessment 
but i have already said how huge it was  and as a result i could see it extremely accurately  its eyes were shining and in general it gave the impression of a living child  just these movements  as if someone was trying them out     as if someone was trying them out   
question  try to explain further what this means 
bertons answer  i dont know if i will succeed  i had this impression  it was intuitive 
i didnt think about it  these movements were unnatural 
question  do you mean to say that  lets say  the hands moved in a way that human hands cannot move because of the limitations of mobility in the joints 
bertons answer  no  not at all  just  these movements did not make any sense  every movement generally means something  serves something    
question  do you think so  the movements of an infant dont necessarily mean anything 
bertons answer  i know that  but the movements of an infant are disorderly  uncoordinated  generalised  and these were  a  i know  they were methodical  they took place one at a time  in groups and in series  as if one wanted to explore what this child was able to do with his hands  and what with his torso and mouth  with the face was the worst  i suppose because the face expresses the most  and this one was  like a face     no  i dont know how to call it  it was alive  yes  but still not human  i mean the features as much as possible  and the eyes  and the complexion  and everything  but the expression  the facial expressions  no 
question  were these grimaces  do you know what a human face looks like in an epileptic attack  bertons answer  yes  i have seen such an attack  i understand  no  it was something else  in epilepsy there are spasms and convulsions  and these were movements that were most fluid and continuous  graceful  or as you would say  melodious  i have no other term for it  and again the face  with the face it was the same thing  a face cannot look so that one half is happy and the other half sad  so that one part of it is threatening or afraid and the other part is triumphant or something like that  but with this child it was just like that  also  all these movements and mimicry play took place with unheard of speed  i was there for a very short time  maybe ten seconds  i dont even know if ten  question  and you want to say that you managed to see all this in such a short time  anyway  how do you know how long it took  did you check it on your watch 
bertons answer  no  i didnt check it on my watch  but ive been flying for sixteen years  in my profession you have to judge time to the nearest second  i mean moments  its all about reflexes  this is needed when landing  a pilot who cannot  regardless of the circumstances  figure out whether a phenomenon lasts five seconds or ten will never be worth much  it is the same with observation  a person learns this with years  to grasp everything in the shortest possible time  question  is that all youve seen  bertons answer  no  but i dont remember the rest so precisely  i suppose the dose was too strong for me  i had  as it were  a congested brain  the fog started to descend and i had to go up  i had to  but i dont remember how or when i did it  for the first time in my life i nearly drifted  my hands were shaking so much that i couldnt hold the rudder properly  i seem to have shouted something and called base  even though i knew there was no communication 
question  did you try to get back then  bertons answer  no  because in the end  when i got out on the ceiling  i thought maybe there was a fechner in one of those holes  i know  it sounds nonsensical  nevertheless  thats what i thought  if these things are happening  i thought  maybe i can find fechner too  so i decided to go into as many holes of mist as i could  but the third time i went up  after what i saw  i realised i couldnt do it  i couldnt  i have to say  this much is known  i got nauseous and vomited in the gondola  i did not know what that meant until now  i have never had nausea  question  it was a symptom of poisoning  berton  bertons answer  possibly  i dont know 
but what i saw the third time i didnt make it up  it wasnt caused by poisoning 
question  how can you know that  bertons answer  it was not a hallucination 
a hallucination is  after all  what my own brain produces  no  question  yes 
bertons answer  well  thats what it was  and thats what he couldnt produce  i will never believe it  he wouldnt be capable of it 
question  rather  tell us what it was  okay  bertons answer  first i have to find out how what i have said so far will be treated  question  what is the significance of that  bertons answer  for me   fundamental  i have said that i saw something that i will never forget again  if the committee thinks that what i have said is at least one per cent probable  so that a proper study of this ocean should be started  i think  in that direction  then i will say anything  but if it is to be regarded by the committee as some maya of mine  i will say nothing  question  why 
bertons answer  because the content of my hallucinations  even if they cry out for vengeance to heaven  is my private affair  the content of my experiences on solaris  on the other hand  is not 
question  does this mean that you refuse to give any further answers until the expeditions competent authorities have reached a decision 
because i think you understand that the committee is not empowered to take an immediate decision  bertons answer  yes  sir   that was the end of the first protocol  there was still an extract from the second  written eleven days later 
 chairman     taking all this into account  the committee  composed of three doctors  three biologists  one physicist  one engineer and the deputy leader of the expedition  came to the conviction that the accidents presented by berton represent the content of a hallucinatory syndrome  running under the influence of the poisoning of the planets atmosphere  with twilight symptoms accompanied by a stimulation of the associative zones of the cerebral cortex  and that nothing or almost nothing corresponded to these accidents in reality 
berton  excuse me  what does nothing or   almost nothing mean  what is almost nothing  how big is that 
guido  i am not finished yet  separately  a votum separatum was recorded from dr archibald messenger  a doctor of physics  who declared that what berton had recounted could  in his opinion  have happened in reality and was worthy of conscientious investigation  that is all 
berton  i repeat the question from a moment ago  guido  the matter is simple   almost nothing  means that certain real phenomena may have initiated your hallucinations  berton  the most normal person might  during a windy night  take a moving bush for some sort of figure  let alone on an alien planet  when the observers mind is under the influence of poison  that doesnt faze you  berton  what is your decision in relation to the above  berton  i would first like to know what are the consequences of this vote of separation by dr messenger 
guido  practically none  it means that research in this direction will not be undertaken  berton  is what we say on the record 
the chairman  yes 
berton  in view of this  i would like to say that  in my opinion  the committee has failed not me   i dont count here   but the spirit of this expedition  as i said the first time  i will not answer any further questions  the chairman  is that all  berton  yes  but i would like to see dr messenger  is that possible  the chairman  naturally   this was the end of the second protocol  at the bottom of the sheet was a note in small print stating that dr messenger had a nearly three hour confidential conversation with berton the following day  after which he addressed the board of experts  demanding that the pilots testimony be re investigated  he claimed that this was supported by new  additional data that berton had provided him with  but which he would only be able to disclose once the council had reached a positive decision  the council  in the persons of shannahan  timolis and trahier  ruled in the negative on this request  whereupon the matter was closed    the book still contained a photocopy of one page of a letter found in messengers posthumous papers  it was probably a brief  ravintzer was unable to ascertain whether this letter had been sent or what its implications were 
      its pyramidal dullness    the text began     for the sake of their authority  the council  and more specifically shannahan and timolis  because trahiers vote does not count  have rejected my demands  i am now addressing the institute directly  but you understand for yourself that this is only a powerless protest  bound by words  i cannot unfortunately convey to you what berton told me  the councils decision was obviously influenced by the fact that a man without any scientific degree came with the revelation  although many a researcher could envy this pilots acumen and talent for observation  please give me the following data by reverse post 
1  fechners biography including his childhood 
2  everything you know about his family and family affairs  he is said to have orphaned a young child 
3  the topography of the town where he grew up 
i would still like to tell you what i think about all this  as you know  some time after the departure of fechner and carrucci  a spot appeared in the centre of the red sun which  with its corpuscular radiation  annihilated radio communications  and  according to the sateloid  mainly in the southern hemisphere  i e  where our base was located  fechner and carrucci moved   of all the research groups   furthest away from the base 
we had not observed such a thick persistent fog in complete silence until the day of the catastrophe during our entire stay on the planet 
i believe that what berton saw was part of operation man  perpetrated by this viscous monster  the actual source of all the creations  perceived by berton  was fechner   his brain  in the course of some mental dissection incomprehensible to us   it was about experimental restoration  the reconstruction of some of the  probably most permanent  traces of his memory 
i know this sounds fantastic  i know i could be wrong  so i ask you to help me  i am currently on alaric and will await your reply there 
your a  
i could scarcely read  it had grown so dark  the book in my hand had gone grey  by the end the print was spilling out in my eyes  but the blank part of the page testified that i had reached the end of the story  which in the light of my own experiences i found very plausible  i turned towards the window  a deep purple stood there  with a few more clouds smouldering above the horizon  like a dying coal  the ocean  shrouded in darkness  was invisible  i could hear the faint furling of paper strips above the fans  the heated air with a faint taste of ozone stood dead  absolute silence filled the entire station  i thought there was nothing heroic about our decision   to stay  the period of heroic planetary struggles  of daring expeditions  of horrific deaths  such as the first victim of the fechner ocean  had long since closed  i almost didnt care anymore who snauts or sartorius guest was  after a while  i thought  we will cease to be ashamed and odosab  ious  if we cant get rid of the  guests   we will get used to them and live with them  and if their creator changes the rules of the game  we will adapt to the new ones as well  although for a while we will chafe  hurl  and maybe even this one or that one will commit suicide  but eventually this future state will also reach its equilibrium  the room was filled with a darkness more and more earth like  already only the white shapes of the washroom and the mirror dispelled the darkness  i got up  found a wad of cotton wool on the shelf in the dark  washed my face with a moistened tampon and lay down on my back on the bed  somewhere above me  similar to the fluttering of a moth  the whirring of a fan floated and quieted  i couldnt even see the window  everything was encompassed by blackness  a streak of an out of nowhere flowing glow hung before me  i dont know whether on the wall or far away  deep in the rounded desert  i remembered how i had been frightened the previous evening by the empty gaze of the solarian space and almost smiled  i wasnt afraid of him  i wasnt afraid of anything  i brought the wrist of my hand closer to my eyes  a phosphorescent garland of digits lit up the dial of my watch  the blue sun was about to rise in an hour  i relished the prevailing darkness  breathed deeply  empty  drained of all thought 
at one point  as i moved  i felt the flat shape of a tape recorder clinging to my hip  right  gibarian  his voice fixed in the reels  it didnt even occur to me to resurrect it  to listen to it  it was all i could do for him  i took out the tape recorder to hide it under the bed  i heard rustling and the faint creak of the door opening 
  kris       came a soft voice  close to a whisper    are you here  kris  its so dark 
 its nothing   i said    dont be afraid  come here
