the next day  returning from lunch  i found a note from   on the table by the window  he reported that   had paused work on the annihilator for the time being  in order to irradiate the ocean with a burst of hard rays as a last attempt   honey   i said   i have to go to  s   the red sunrise glowed in the windows and divided the room in two  we were in a blue shade  outside its border  everything seemed copper  youd think any book would jingle when it fell off the shelf    this is the experiment  i just dont know how to do it  id rather  you understand    i stopped    dont explain yourself     i would like that    if it didnt last long   its going to take a while   i said   listen  what if you came with me and waited in the hall     okay  but what if i cant stand it    what is it like  i asked  and added quickly   im not asking out of curiosity  you understand  but perhaps  once you figured it out  youd be able to control it yourself    its fear   she said  she turned a little pale   i cant even tell what im afraid of because im not really afraid  im just losing myself   at the last moment i still feel such  such shame  i cant tell you  and then nothing  thats why i thought it was some kind of disease       she finished more quietly and shuddered   maybe its only here in this cursed station   i said   as for me  ill do everything to get us out of her as soon as possible     do you think its possible  she opened her eyes    why not  after all  im not chained here    anyway  that will also depend on what i agree with    how long do you think you can be alone   it depends     she said slowly  she lowered her head   if i can hear your voice  i think ill be fine     id rather you didnt hear what were saying  not that i have anything to hide from you  but i dont know  i cant know what   will say    do not end  i see  okay  i will stand so that i can only hear the sound of your voice  it is enough for me    ill call him from the studio now  ill leave the door open  she nodded  i stepped out through a wall of red sunlight into a corridor that was almost black by contrast despite the artificial lighting  the door of the small studio stood open  the mirrored remains of a dewar flask lying on the floor beneath a row of great reservoirs of liquid oxygen were the last trace of the nights events  the small screen lit up as i took off the phone and dialed the radio number  the bluish film of light that seemed to coat frosted glass on the inside cracked  and    leaning sideways over the arm of a high chair  looked me straight in the eye   hello   he said    i read the card  id like to talk to you  can i come    you can  in a second    yes    please  or    in company    no  his skinny face  brown from sunburn  with thick transverse wrinkles on his forehead  tilted slanted in convex glass  as if he were a strange fish living in an aquarium  from which he peeped through the glass  took on an ambiguous expression   well  well   he said    so  im waiting   we can go  honey   i began with not quite natural animation  entering the cabin through red streaks of light beyond which i could only see  s looming silhouette  the voice failed me  she sat slumped in an armchair  her elbows folded under the armrests  did she hear my footsteps too late  or couldnt she release that terrible spasm quickly enough to assume a normal pose  but i saw her for a second struggling with that incomprehensible force that was within her  and my heart was choked by a blind  mad anger mixed with pity  we walked silently along a long corridor  passing its sections covered with multi colored enamel  which was   in the intention of the architects   to diversify the stay in the armored shell  from a distance  i saw the open door of the radio station  a long streak of red fell from them down the corridor  because the sun was shining here too  i looked at    who didnt even try to smile  saw her all the way  focused  preparing to fight with herself  the impending exertion had already changed her face  which had gone pale and seemed to shrink  a dozen paces from the door she stopped  i turned to her  she pushed me lightly with her fingertips to go  and suddenly my plans     the experiment  the whole station  everything seemed to me as nothing compared to the ordeal she had come here to face  i felt like a tormentor and was about to turn back  when a wide streak of sunlight  broken on the wall of the corridor  was obscured by a human shadow  quickening my pace  i entered the cabin    was on the doorstep  as if he was heading to meet me  the red sun was in a straight line behind him  and a purple glow seemed to radiate from his gray hair  we stared at each other for a while  saying nothing  he seemed to be examining my face  i couldnt see his expression  blinded by the glare of the window  i walked around him and stood next to a high desk from which the flexible stems of microphones protruded  he turned slowly on the spot  following me calmly with that slight curve of his lips  which  in fact  hardly changed  became now a smile  sometimes a grimace of fatigue  without taking his eyes off me  he walked over to the all wall metal cabinet  which was heaped on either side with hastily discarded piles of spare radio parts  thermal batteries  and tools  pulled a chair over there  and sat down  leaning his back against the enamel door  the silence we had kept until now was becoming strange to say the least  i listened to them  focusing on the silence that filled the corridor where   stayed  but there was not the slightest murmur    when will you be ready  i asked    we could even start today  but the record will take some time    the record  you mean encephalogram    well  you agreed  what  he paused    no  nothing   i hear you     said as silence began to build between us again   she already knows    about herself   i lowered my voice almost to a whisper  he raised his eyebrows    yes  i got the impression he wasnt really surprised  so why was he pretending  at one point i didnt feel like talking  but i prevailed  let it be loyalty  i thought  if nothing else  she must have guessed from our conversation in the library  watched me  added one thing to another  then found  s tape recorder and listened to the tape    he didnt change his position  still leaning against the wardrobe  but there was a small twinkle in his eyes  standing at the lectern  i had the wing of the door open in front of me  opening onto the corridor  i lowered my voice even more   she tried to kill herself last night while i was sleeping  liquid oxygen    something rustled like a draft through loose papers  i froze  listening to what was in the corridor  but the source of the murmur was closer  it rattled like a mouse    mouse  nonsense  there were no mice here  i watched from under the seats eye   im listening   he said calmly   of course she failed    at least she knows who she is     why are you telling me this  he asked suddenly  i didnt know what to say at first   i want you to know    so you know what its like   i muttered    i warned you   you mean you knew   i raised my voice involuntarily    no  of course not  but i explained to you how it is  each  visitor  is almost a phantom when he arrives  apart from a jumble of memories and images drawn from his    adam    he is actually empty  the longer he is here with you  the more human he becomes  to certain limits  of course  so the longer it goes on  the harder it gets    he broke off  looked at me scowling and said casually   she knows everything    yes  i told you already    everything  that shes been here once before and that you     no   he smiled      listen  if thats what youre going to do  exactly  leave the station    yes    with her    yes   he was silent  as if thought over his answer  but there was something else in his silence    what  again that imperceptible breeze rustled just behind a thin wall  he shifted in his chair   excellent   he said   do as you wish  my dear  it would look nice if  on top of everything  we started using mousse  im not going to convince you  ill just tell you this  you are trying   in an inhumane situation   to act like a human  it may be beautiful  but its useless  anyway  im not sure about this beauty either  because can something stupid be beautiful  but thats not the point  you resign from further experience  you want to leave  taking her  yes    yes    but its also    an experience  do you think    how do you understand that  will she    be able to     if youre with me  i cant see    i spoke slower and slower until i stopped    sighed slightly   were all ostrich politics here     but at least we know it and were not pretending to be nobility    im not posing for anything  okay  i didnt mean to offend you  i take back what i said about nobility  but the ostrich policy remains in place  you are cultivating it in a particularly dangerous form  youre lying to yourself and to her and to yourself again  do you know the conditions for stabilizing a system made of neutrino matter    no  and you dont know  nobody knows this    of course  but one thing we do know is that such a system is unstable and can only exist thanks to a constant supply of energy  i know this from    this energy creates a twisted stabilizing field  now  is this field external to the  visitor   or is the source of this field within his body  do you understand the difference    yes   i said slowly   if its external  then    she  then         the system will break up as it moves away from solaris   he finished for me   we cant predict it  but youve already done the experiment  that rocket you launched    its still circling  you know  i even calculated the elements in my spare time  you can fly  go into orbit  get close and find out what happened to the    passenger     youre crazy   i hissed   you think so  well    what if     no  it can be done  its remote controlled  well bring it out of orbit and      stop it    also  no  so theres one way  very simple  it doesnt even have to land on the station  yes  let it go on  only on the radio  if shes alive  shell call back and     but  but the oxygen has long since run out   i choked out     maybe he cares without oxygen  well  shall we try               kclvin          he mimicked me angrily    think about what kind of man are you  who do you want to make happy  save  myself  i  which  this or that  are you not brave enough for both  you see where this leads  im telling you for the last time  this  here  is an immoral situation  suddenly i heard the same scratching sound as before  like nails scratching the wall  i dont know why a kind of passive  muddy calm came over me  it was as if i was watching the whole situation  the two of us  from a great distance through inverted binoculars  minor  a bit funny  not important   okay then   i said    and what do you think i should do  remove it  itll be the same tomorrow  wont it  and once more  and so every day  how long  for what  whats in it for me  and you     station    no  you answer me first  you will start with it and  lets say  witness the following transformation  in a few minutes youll see in front of you      well  what  i said with a sneer    a monster  demon  eh    no  plain  plain agony  have you really believed in their immortality  i assure you they are dying    what will you do then  will you be back for    reserve    stop    i screamed clenching my fist  he stared at me with an indulgent sneer in narrowed eyes    oh  should i stop  you know  if i were you  id drop this conversation  youd better do something else  you can  for example  slash with rods   for revenge   the ocean  what do you mean  so  if   he made a playful farewell gesture with his hand while raising his eyes to the ceiling as if he was following a receding figure   will you be a scoundrel  so  isnt it  smile when you want to howl  pretend to be happy and calm when you want to bite your fingers  then youre not a scoundrel  what if you cant not be here  then what  youre going to be mad at    whos to blame for everything  right  well  on top of that  youre an idiot  my dear     youre talking about yourself   i said with my head bowed    i love her    who  your memory    no  i  i told you what she wanted to do  thats not what a lot of    real people would do    you admit it yourself when you say      dont take my word for it    okay  so she loves you  and you want to love her  it is not the same    youre wrong       im sorry  but you got into your intimate affairs yourself  you do not love  you love  shes ready to give her life  you too  very touching  very beautiful  noble  anything you want  but theres no room for all of that here  there isnt  understand  no  you dont want to understand that  you are entangled by forces beyond our control in a circular process of which she is a part  phase  a repeating rhythm  if it were    if you were haunted by a do it all monstrosity  you wouldnt hesitate a moment to remove it  truth    truth   so  maybe thats why shes not such a monster   does it tie your hands  thats what its all about to keep you tied   just one more hypothesis to the millions in the library      come on  shes    no  i dont want to talk about it with you    okay  you started it yourself  but just think  shes basically a mirror reflecting part of your brain  if its great  its because your memory was great  you gave the recipe  circular process  dont forget    so what do you want from me  that i    that i remove it  i already asked you  why should i do this  you did not answer    i will answer you now  i didnt invite you to this interview  i didnt touch your affairs  i dont command you or forbid you  and i wouldnt even if i could  its you  you came here and laid it all out for me  and you know what for  no  in order to take it off  knock it down  i know the burden  my dear  yes  yes  dont interrupt me  im not interrupting you  but you  you want me to interrupt you  if i stood in your way  maybe youd smash my head in  then youd be dealing with me  someone made of the same blood and clay as you  and youd feel like a man yourself  and yes    you cant handle it  and thats why youre arguing with me    and  in fact  with yourself  just tell me youd be bent over in agony if she suddenly disappeared  no  dont say anything    well  you know  i came to tell you out of simple loyalty that i intend to leave the station with her   i fended off his attack  but found it unconvincing myself  snow shrugged    its very possible that you need to stick to yours  if ive spoken on this at all  its only because youre going higher and higher  and falling from a height  you understand    come up tomorrow morning around nine oclock to  s    will you come   to     i asked in surprise    he doesnt let anyone in  you said you cant even make a phone call   hes done fine now  we dont talk about it  you know  you are    its quite different  well  smaller  will you come in the morning   ill come   i murmured  i was looking at    his left hand casually hid behind the wardrobe door  when did they turn away  it must have been quite a long time ago  but in the excitement of this terrible conversation for me  i didnt pay attention to it  how unnatural it looked    like    he was hiding something there  or if someone was holding his hand  i licked my lips      what are you    go out   he said softly  very calmly    get out  i left and closed the door behind me in the last red glow    was sitting on the floor about ten paces away  against the wall  she jumped up at the sight of me    you see     she said looking at me with shining eyes    it worked       yes  it did  im happy  maybe    maybe it will get better     oh  sure   i replied absently  we walked back to each other and i was racking my brains over this idiotic wardrobe  so  so he was hiding there     and all this conversation     my cheeks started to burn so much that i rubbed them involuntarily  god  what madness  and what actually happened  on nothing  thats right  tomorrow morning    and suddenly i was afraid  almost like last night  my encephalogram  the total record of all brain processes  translated into ray burst fluctuations  will be sent down  into the depths of this boundless  boundless monster  as he said   if she were to disappear  youd be in terrible pain  wouldnt you      an encephalogram is a complete record  including unconscious processes  if i want her to disappear  to die  otherwise  would i be so terrified that she survived this terrible attack  responsible for my own subconscious  if im not responsible for it  who would     what an idiot  why on earth did i agree that mine  my    i can study it beforehand  of course  this record  but it i cant read it  no one can  specialists can only determine what the subject was thinking about  but the same generalities  that  for example  he was solving a mathematical problem  but they cant tell what  they say its impossible  because the encephalogram is a resultant  a mixture of a multitude of simultaneously running processes  and only some of them have a psychic  lining     and the subconscious ones    they dont want to talk about those at all  and where is it for them to read someones memories  repressed or not suppressed    but why so b oh  after all  i told   this morning that this experiment wouldnt work  well  because if our neurophysiologists cant read the record  then why would this most alien  black  liquid giant     but it entered me  i dont know how  to traverse all my memory and find its most painful atom  how to doubt it  and without any help  without any kind of  radiant transmission   it penetrated through the double encapsulated armor  through the heavy shells of the station  found my body inside and left with the loot              said softly  at the window  staring with unseeing eyes at the beginning of the night  a delicate endosperm  faint at this latitude  obscured the stars  a uniform but thin layer of clouds so high that the sun from the depths  below the horizon  gave them the faintest  pink silver glow  that will mean i wanted it that i killed her not to go there they cant make me but what will i tell them  that there may be thoughts  intentions  hopes  cruel  wonderful  murderous thoughts in me  and i know nothing about them man set out to meet other worlds  other civilizations  not fully knowing his own nooks  dead ends  wells  barricaded dark door  give her to them    out of shame  spend it just because i lack the courage           whispered even more quietly than before  i felt rather than heard her silently approach me and pretended i didnt know  i wanted to be alone right now  i had to be alone  i havent made a decision yet  no resolution has been made  staring up at the darkening sky  at the stars that were only the spectral shadow of earths stars  i stood motionless  and in the emptiness that replaced the racing thoughts of a moment ago  there grew a wordless dead  indifferent certainty that where i could not reach  i had already chosen and pretended that nothing had happened  i didnt even have the strength to despise myself
