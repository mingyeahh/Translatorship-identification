i had burns on my face and hands  i remembered that when i was looking for a sleeping pill for    i would laugh at my naivety now if i could   i noticed a jar of burn cream in the medicine cabinet  so i went to my room  i opened the door and in the red sunset light i saw that someone was sitting in the chair where   had been kneeling before  fear paralyzed me  i jerked backwards in panic to run  it lasted a fraction of a second  the seated man lifted his head  it was    crossed  his back to me  he was still wearing the same reagent stained canvas pants  he was flipping through some papers  the whole sheaf of them lay on the table next to it  when he saw me  he put them all down and stared at me for a while  frowning over his lowered spectacles  without a word  i went to the washroom  took a semi liquid ointment from the first aid kit and began to apply it to the most burned places on my forehead and cheeks  fortunately  i was not very swollen  and my eyes  thanks to the fact that i squeezed my eyelids tightly  were saved  i pricked a few of the larger blisters on my temple and cheek with a sterile injection needle and squeezed out the serous fluid  then i stuck two sheets of moistened gauze over my face  all the while    was watching me carefully  i ignored it  when i finally finished these procedures  and my face was burning more and more   i sat down in the other chair  i had to take  s dress off him first  it was a perfectly ordinary dress  apart from the story with a clasp that wasnt there     hands folded on his pointed knee  watched my movements critically    well  shall we have a chat  he said as i sat down  i didnt answer  pressing down on the sheet of gauze that began to slide down my cheek    we had guests  didnt we   yes   i replied dryly  i had no desire to tune in to his tone    and we got rid of  wow  wow  you went about it impetuously  he touched the still flaky skin on his forehead  there were pink patches of fresh skin on it  i stared at them dumbfounded  why hasnt   and   so called tan given me food for thought until now  all this time i thought it was from the sun   and no one sunbathes on solaris      but you started small  didnt you  he said  oblivious to the flash of sudden understanding that dawned on me    miscellaneous  narcotica  venena  free american   what    what do you want  we can talk on equal terms  if you want to clown  you better go   sometimes youre a clown involuntarily   he said  he looked up at me with narrowed eyes   youre not going to tell me you didnt use a rope or a hammer   didnt you throw the inkwell like luther  no  hey   he grimaced   you are a real glory  even the washroom is complete  you didnt try to smash your head at all  nothing  you didnt demolish the room at all  you just did it right away  smack  packed  fired  and its done   he looked at his watch   we should have about two or three hours then   he concluded  he looked at me  looked at me with an unpleasant smile  and went on   so you say you take me for a pig    for a finished pig   i agreed firmly    yes  would you believe me if i told you  would you believe a single word  i was silent     had it happen first   he went on  still with that fake smirk    he locked himself in his cabin and spoke only through the door  and we  guess what we said  i knew  but i preferred to remain silent    sure  we thought he was crazy  he told us a bit through the door  but not everything  can you even guess why he concealed who was with him  well  you already know  suum cuique  but he was a real explorer  he demanded that we give him a chance    what chance   well  i suppose he tried to classify it  sort it out  sort it out  worked nights   do you know what he was doing  you sure know   these calculations   i said    in the drawer  in the radio station  is it him    yes  but i didnt know anything about it then    how long it took    hospitality  i guess a week  conversations through the door  well  what was going on there  we thought he was hallucinating and motorized  i was giving him scopolamine    how is it    him     yeah  he did  but not for himself  he experimented  thats how it went     and you       us  on the third day  we decided to get to him  to break the door  if there is no other way  we wanted to treat him out of goodness    and    thats why  i snapped    yes   and there    in that wardrobe      yes  dear boy  yes  he didnt know that in the meantime we were also visited by guests  and we couldnt take care of him anymore  he didnt know about it  now its    its kind of    routine  he said it so softly that i guessed the last word rather than heard it   wait  i dont understand   i said    well  then  you must have heard  you yourself said you were eavesdropping  you must have heard two voices  so      no  only his voice  and even if there were incomprehensible murmurs  you understand that we attributed all of them to him      only him     but    why    i do not know  i do have a theory about it  though  but i dont think its worth rushing into it  especially since explaining this and that doesnt help  yes  but you must have seen something yesterday  or you would have taken us both for madmen    i thought i was crazy myself    ah yes  and you havent seen anyone    i saw    who   his grimace was no longer a smirk  i stared at him for a long time before i replied   the    black one     he didnt speak  but his whole body  shrunken and bent forward  relaxed slightly   you could have warned me after all   i began  less confidently now    i did warn you    how    in the only possible way  see  i didnt know who it would be  nobody knew that  you cant know that      listen     a few questions  youve known it    for some time  is this    that    what will become of her   you mean will he come back     yes    hell come back and he wont come back    what does it mean    shell be back just like she was at the beginning of her    first visit  she just wont know anything  or to be more precise  shell act as if everything you did to get rid of her never happened  if you dont force her to do so  she wont be aggressive      what situation    it depends on the circumstances         what do you mean    we cant afford the luxury of concealment   its not a luxury   he interrupted dryly       i have a feeling you still dont understand    or  wait  his eyes flashed    can you tell who was here  i swallowed  i lowered my head  i didnt want to look at him  i wish it was someone else  not him  but i had no choice  a sheet of gauze peeled off and fell on my hand  i flinched at the slippery touch    a woman who    i didnt finish    she killed herself  she gave herself    injected    he waited    she committed suicide     he asked  seeing me silent    yes    thats all  i was silent    this cant be all    i looked up quickly  he didnt look at me    how do you know  he did not answer   okay   i said  i licked my lips    we argued  not really  i told her  you know how to speak in anger  i took my belongings and moved out  she made it clear  she didnt say it directly  but when you live with someone for years  its not necessary     i was sure that she only said that   that she would be afraid to do it and that     too i told her  the next day i remembered that i had left these     injections in the drawer  she knew about them   i brought them from the laboratory  i needed them   i told her then what the action was  i got scared and wanted to go get them  but then i thought it would look like i took her words seriously  and    i left it like that  but on the third day i went anyway  it didnt give me peace  already    when i came  she was already dead    ah  you innocent boy    i was hooked  but when i looked at him  i realized that he was not mocking  i saw him for the first time  his face was grey  unspeakable fatigue lay in the deep furrows of his cheeks  he looked like a seriously ill man    why do you say that  i asked  strangely intimidated  because this story is tragic  no  no  he added quickly  seeing me move  you still dont understand  of course  you may have the hardest time  even consider yourself a killer  but    its not the worst    what are you talking about  i said mockingly   im glad you dont believe me  really   what happened may be terrible  but the scariest thing is what    didnt happen  never   i dont understand     i said weakly  i really didnt understand anything  he nodded   a normal man   he said    what is a normal person  one who has never done anything heinous  yes  but has he never thought about it  or maybe he didnt even think  but something inside him thought  swarmed  ten or thirty years ago  maybe he defended himself against it and forgot it  and he wasnt afraid of it  because he knew he would never put it into practice  yes  now imagine that all at once  on a full day  among other people  he meets it embodied  chained to himself  indestructible  what then  what do you have then  i was silent   the station   he said quietly    then you have the solaris station    but    what could it possibly be    i said hesitantly   you are not a criminal or         but you are a psychologist     he interrupted me impatiently  who hasnt had a dream like this before  moonshine  think of    a fetishist who fell in love  i know  with a piece of dirty underwear  who  risking his skin  obtained by threat and begging his dearest  disgusting rag  it must be fun  huh  who at the same time abhors the object of his lust and is crazy about it and is ready to risk his life for it  perhaps matching romeos feelings for juliet    such things happen  true  but you understand that there must also be things    situations    such that no one has dared to bring them into existence  except in their mind  in some single moment of bewilderment  collapse  madness  call it what you will  then the word becomes flesh  thats all   its    everything   i repeated in a meaningless  wooden voice  my head was buzzing    but  but the station  whats up with the station   you must be pretending   he murmured  he looked at me searchingly    im still talking about solaris  only solaris  nothing else  its not my fault if its so drastically different from your expectations  besides  youve been through enough to at least listen to me to the end  we go into space  prepared for everything  that is  for loneliness  for struggle  martyrdom and death  out of modesty  we dont say it out loud  but sometimes we think were great  meanwhile  meanwhile  thats not all  and our readiness turns out to be a pose  we do not want to conquer space at all  we only want to extend the earth to its limits  some planets are supposed to be desert like the sahara  others icy like the pole or tropical like the brazilian jungle  we are humane and noble  we dont want to conquer other races  we just want to pass on our values to them and take their heritage in return  we consider ourselves knights of sacred contact  this is the second fake  were not looking for anyone but humans  we dont need other worlds  we need mirrors  we dont know what to do with other worlds  one is enough and were already choking on it  we want to find our own idealized image  these are supposed to be globes  civilizations more perfect than ours  in others we expect to find again the image of our primitive past  meanwhile  on the other side  there is something we do not accept  against which we defend ourselves  and yet we did not bring only the distillate of virtues from earth  the heroic statue of man  we came here as we really are  and when the other side shows us this truth   the part of it that we keep silent about   we cant agree    so what is it  i asked  listening patiently   what we wanted  contact with another civilization   we got him  that contact  exaggerated as under a microscope  our own monstrous ugliness  our buffoonery and shame    there was rage in his voice   so you think its    an ocean   that its him  but why  never mind the mechanism now  but for gods sake  why   do you seriously think he wants to play with us  or punish us   this is just primitive demonology  a planet controlled by a very big devil who  to satisfy his satanic humor  gives members of a scientific expedition succubus  you dont believe in such complete idiocy  do you   the devil isnt that stupid   he muttered through his teeth  i looked at him surprised  it occurred to me that he might have had a nervous breakdown after all  even if what was going on at the station wasnt explained by madness  reactive psychosis     i shuddered as he chuckled softly    are you giving me a diagnosis  wait some more  in fact  youve experienced it so mildly that you still dont know anything    i see  the devil took pity on me  i said  the conversation was starting to bore me    what do you want  let me tell you what plans x trillion metamorphic plasma have against us  perhaps none    how are none  i asked dumbfounded    was still smiling   you should know that science only deals with how things happen  not why things happen  how  well  it started eight or nine days after the x ray experiment  maybe the ocean responded to the radiation with some other radiation  maybe it probed our brains with it and extracted some psychic encapsulations from them    encapsulations  this started to interest me    well  processes detached from  the rest  closed in on themselves  repressed  walled up  some incendiary foci of memory  he took it as a recipe  as a blueprint     you know how similar the asymmetric crystals of chromosomes and those nucleoside connections of cerebrosides that are the substrate of memory processes     hereditary plasma is  after all  a  memory  plasma  he wrote us down  and then  you know what happened next  but why was it done  prom  not to destroy us  anyway  it would have been much easier for him  in general  with such technological freedom  he could pretty much do anything  ah   i exclaimed   thats why you were so frightened the first evening i came in   two years ago    he started to laugh softly  as if my stupor gave him god knows what satisfaction  but then he stopped  there are more  but i know only one  i can be killed with you    and not them    i dont advise you to try  a terrible spectacle    nothing    i do not know  at least not with poison  knife  noose      a nuclear blaster    would you try    i do not know  if you know theyre not people    when they are in a way  they are subjectively human  they are not even aware of their    origin  have you noticed it    yes  so    how is it    they regenerate at an incredible rate  at an impossible rate  in front of my eyes  i tell you  and they start acting like    like      like what    like our ideas about them  those memory records according to which      yes  its true  i confirmed  i didnt care that the ointment ran down my burned cheeks and onto my hands    did   know     i asked suddenly  he looked at me carefully    did he know what we knew    yes    almost certainly    how do you know he told you    no  but i found a book with him     the little apocrypha   i cried  jumping up   yes  how do you know that    calm down   i said   you can see im burned and not recovering at all  there was a letter for me in the cabin    what are you talking about   letter  what was in it   to the solaria annex  to this apocrypha  what is this    old thing  its possible it has something to do with it  you have  he pulled a thin leather bound volume  worn at the corners  from his pocket and handed it to me    and       i threw the book away    what    everyone behaves in such a situation as     he can  he tries to be normal   with him that means official    well  you know    of course  i was with him once in a situation  never mind the details  enough that we had eight five hundred kilograms of oxygen left  one by one we quit our daily activities  by the end we were all bearded  he was the only one shaving  polishing his shoes  hes such a man  naturally  whatever he does now will be make believe  comedy or crime    a crime  so not a crime  we have to come up with a new word for it  like  jet set divorce   sounds better    youre extremely witty   i said   would you like me to cry  suggest something    oh  leave me alone    no  seriously  you know about as much as i do now  plan    are you good  i dont know what ill do when      he shows up again  he has to show up    more like that    how do they get inside  after all  the station is airtight  maybe the armor     he shook his head   the armors fine  i have no idea how  most of the time we have visitors after waking up  and then you have to sleep from time to time    look here       you mean taking down the station  but you want it to come from me   he shook his head   its not that simple  of course  we can always run away  even to a satellite  and send an sos from there  theyll treat us   of course  like madmen   some sanatorium on earth  until we cancel everything nicely   after all  there are cases of collective madness in such isolated facilities     it would not be the worst  perhaps  the garden  the peace  the white rooms  the walks with the nurses    he spoke quite seriously  hands in his pockets  staring with unseeing eyes into the corner of the room  the red sun had already disappeared over the horizon and the crested waves had melted into an inky desert  the sky was on fire  above this two colored landscape  indescribably gloomy  lilac edged clouds floated    so you want to run away  or not  not yet  he smiled    indomitable conqueror    you havent tasted it yet or you wouldnt insist so  its not about what i want  its about what is possible    what    thats what i dont know    so were staying here  you think theres a middle ground    he looked at me  skinny  his face scaly and furrowed    who knows  maybe it will pay off  he said finally   we wont know anything about him  but maybe about us     he turned around  picked up his papers and left  i wanted to stop him  but my open mouth made no sound  there was nothing to do  i could only wait  i walked over to the window and stared out at the blood black ocean  barely seeing it  it occurred to me that i could lock myself in one of the rockets at the airport  but i didnt mean it seriously  it was too stupid  id have to leave sooner or later  i sat down by the window and took out the book that   had given me  there was still enough light  it turned the pages pink  the whole room glowed red  these were   collected by a certain otto ravintzer  master of philosophy   articles and works of generally unequivocal value  every science is always accompanied by some pseudo science  its bizarre distortion in certain types of minds  astronomy has its caricaturist in astrology  chemistry once had it in alchemy  so it is understandable that the birth of solaristics was accompanied by a veritable explosion of mental freaks  ravintzers book was filled with this kind of spiritual nourishment  preceded  moreover  it must be added loyally  by an introduction by his pen in which he distanced himself from that panopticum  he simply believed  not without reason  that such a collection could be a valuable document of time  both for a historian and a psychologist of science  bertons report featured prominently in the book  it consisted of several parts  the first was a copy of his log book  very laconic  from 2 pm to 4 40 pm  the conventional time of the expedition  the notes were laconic and negative  altitude 1000   or 1200   or 800 meters   nothing observed   empty ocean  this was repeated several times  then at 4 40 p m   a red mist rises  visibility 700 meters  an empty ocean  at 17 00  fog thickens  silence  visibility 400 meters  with clear spells  i go down to 200  at 5 20 pm  im in fog  altitude 200  visibility 20 40 meters  silence  ascending 400  at 5 45 pm  altitude 500  shoal of fog to the horizon  in the fog   funnel shaped openings through which the surface of the ocean rubs  something is happening in them  im trying to enter one of these sinkholes  at 5 52pm  i see a kind of vortex   throwing up yellow foam  surrounded by a wall of fog  altitude 100  going down to 20  that was the end of bertons log book entry  the continuation of the so called report was an excerpt from his medical history  or more precisely  the text of a confession dictated by berton  interspersed with questions from committee members   berton  when i got down to thirty meters  it became difficult to maintain altitude because there were gusty winds in this circular  fog free space  i had to apply myself to the controls  so for a while   maybe 10 or 15 minutes   i didnt look out of the gondola  as a result  i entered the mist unintentionally  a strong gust carried me into it  it was not an ordinary fog  but a kind of suspension  i think  colloidal  because it dragged all my windows  i had a lot of trouble cleaning them  it was very sticky  meanwhile  my revs were reduced by thirty odd percent due to the propellers resistance to some kind of fog  so that i began to lose altitude  since i was very low and i was afraid that i would capsize on the wave  i gave it full throttle  the plane maintained altitude but did not go up  i had four more rocket booster patrons  i didnt use them thinking things might get worse and id need them then  at full speed  a very strong vibration was created  i guessed that the propeller was caked with this strange slurry  but the load gauges were still at zero  so there was nothing i could do about it  i hadnt seen the sun since i stepped into the mist  but it was phosphorescent red towards him  i kept circling  hoping to eventually make it to one of those fog free places  and i did  about half an hour later  i flew into a free space  almost perfectly circular  several hundred meters in diameter  its boundary was a mist swirling violently  as if carried away by strong convection currents  so i tried to stay in the center of the  hole  as much as possible   the air was calmest there  then i noticed a change in the surface of the ocean  the waves had almost completely disappeared  and the surface layer of this liquid   what the ocean is made of   became semi transparent  with smoke that was fading away  until after a short time it was completely clarified  and i could look down through a layer probably several meters thick  and there was a sort of yellow slime accumulating there  rising in thin  vertical streaks  and when it rose to the top  it became a glassy gleam  began to churn and it frothed and hardened  it was like a very thick  burnt sugar syrup then  this ooze or slime gathered in thick knots  rose above the surface  made cauliflower like heights  and slowly formed various shapes  it began to pull me towards the wall of mist  so i had to parry the motion with spin and rudder for a few minutes  and when i could look again  below me  i saw what looked like a garden   yes  garden  i saw stunted trees and hedges and paths  not real   all of the same substance that had already solidified like yellowish plaster  this is what it looked like  the surface shone brightly  and i lowered myself as far as i could to examine it closely  question  did those trees and other plants you saw have leaves  bertons answer  no  it was just a general shape   like a model of a garden  oh yes  model  thats what it looked like  model  but probably life size  after a while everything began to crack and break  through the cracks that were completely black  thick mucus squeezed to the surface in waves and congealed  some dripping and some staying  and everything began to storm more and more vigorously  covered with foam and nothing but it i have not seen  at the same time  the fog began to squeeze me from all sides  so i increased my revs and went out to 300 meters  question  are you absolutely sure that what you saw was like a garden   and nothing else  bertons answer  yes  because i noticed various details there  i remember  for example  that in one place there were sort of square boxes standing in a row  then it occurred to me that it could be an apiary  question  did it occur to you later  but not the moment you saw it  bertons answer  no  because it was all made of plaster  and i saw other things  question  what things  bertons answer  i cant say which ones  because i havent had time to watch them  i got the impression that there were some tools lying under a few bushes  they were oblong shapes with protruding teeth like plaster casts of small gardening machines  but im not quite sure of that  that one   yes  question  didnt you think it was a hallucination  bertons answer  no  i thought it was a mirage  i didnt think about hallucinating because i felt perfectly fine  and also because i had never seen anything like it in my life  when i got three hundred meters  the mist was riddled with pits beneath me  it looked just like cheese  some of these holes were empty and i could see the ocean rippling through them  and others were seething  i went down to one of these places  and at forty meters i saw that under the surface of the ocean   but quite shallow   lies a wall  as if the wall of a very large building  it shone brightly through the waves and had rows of regular rectangular openings like windows  and it even seemed to me that in some windows something was moving  im not quite sure about that anymore  this wall began to slowly rise and emerge from the ocean  mucus was dripping down it in waterfalls and slimy formations  veined densities  suddenly it broke in two and went in so fast that it immediately disappeared  i pulled the plane up again and flew so close to the fog that the undercarriage was almost touching it  i saw another empty funnel shaped space   it was probably several times larger than the first  already from a distance i saw something floating  it seemed to me  because it was clear  almost white  that it was fechners suit  especially since the shape resembled a man  i turned the machine very sharply  i was afraid that i might miss this place and not find it again  the figure lifted slightly then  and looked as if it were swimming or standing waist deep in a wave  i was in a hurry and got so low that i felt the landing gear hit something soft  the crest of the wave  i suppose  because there was a lot of it there  the man  yes  he was a man  he wasnt wearing a suit  still  he was moving  question  have you seen his face  bertons answer  yes  question  who was it  bertons response  it was a baby  question  what child  have you ever seen them anywhere in your life  bertons answer  no  never  anyway  i dont remember  anyway  as soon as i got close   i was about forty meters away from him  maybe a little more   i realized that there was something wrong with him  question  what do you mean by that  bertons answer  ill tell you right now  i didnt know what it was at first  it took me a while to realize  it was extraordinarily large  huge is still an understatement  it must have been four meters  i remember clearly that when the landing gear hit the wave  his face was slightly above mine  and although i was in the cabin  i must have been three meters above the surface of the ocean  question  if it was that big  how did you know it was a baby  bertons answer  because it was a very small child  question  dont you think  berton  that your answer is illogical  bertons answer  no  not at all  because i saw his face  and besides  the proportions of the body were childlike  he looked like    almost a baby  no  thats an exaggeration  maybe it was two or three years old  he had black hair and blue eyes  huge  and it was naked  completely naked  like newborn  it was wet  or rather slippery  his skin so shiny  the sight had a terrible effect on me  i no longer believed in any mirage  i saw them too closely  it rose and fell with the flow of the wave  but moved no matter what  it was disgusting  question  why  what was it doing  bertons answer  it looked  well  like in a museum  like a doll  but like a living doll  it opened and closed its mouth and made all sorts of disgusting movements  yes  because those werent his moves  question  how do you understand that  bertons response  i didnt get closer than a dozen meters to it  twenty might be the best estimate  but ive already told you how huge it was  and that allowed me to see it remarkably well  his eyes were sparkling  and he looked like a living child in general  only those movements  as if someone was trying     as if someone was trying them     question  please try to explain in more detail what it means  bertons answer  i dont know if i can  i got that impression  it was intuitive  i didnt think about it  the movements were unnatural  question  are you saying that  for example  the hands moved in a way that human hands cannot  due to limited mobility in the joints  bertons answer  no  not at all  its just    those moves didnt make any sense  every move usually means something  serves a purpose    question  do you think so  baby movements dont have to mean anything  bertons answer  i know that  but the babys movements are erratic  uncoordinated  generalized  and those were  oh  i know  they were methodical  they took place sequentially  in groups and series  as if someone wanted to examine what this child is able to do with his hands  and what with his torso and mouth  the face was the worst  i suppose because the face expresses the most  and this one was like a face     no  i cant name  she was alive  yes  but she wasnt human  i mean the features  and the eyes  and the complexion  and everything  but the expression  facial expressions  not  question  were they grimaces  do you know what the face of a person in an epileptic attack looks like  bertons answer  yes  i saw such an attack  i see  no  it was something else  in epilepsy there are spasms and tremors  and these movements were perfectly smooth and continuous  graceful  or how to say melodious  i have no other term  and again the face  with the face was the same  a face cant look like half happy and the other half sad  half threatening or scared and the other triumphant or something like that  but that was the case with this child  besides  all these movements and facial expressions were performed with incredible speed  i was there very briefly  maybe ten seconds  i dont even know if ten  question  and you mean to say youve seen it all in such a short time  anyway  how do you know how long it took  did you check it on your watch  bertons answer  no  i didnt check my watch  but ive been flying for sixteen years  in my profession you have to judge time to the second  i mean moments  its all about reflexes  this is needed when landing  a pilot who cant tell whether a phenomenon lasts five seconds or ten  no matter what the circumstances  will never be worth much  its the same with observation  man learns it over the years  to grab everything in the shortest possible time  question  is this all youve seen  bertons answer  no  but i dont remember the rest so well  i suppose the dose was too strong for me  i had a kind of brain cork  the fog started to descend and i had to go up  i had to  but i dont remember how or when i did it  for the first time in my life  i nearly capped  my hands were shaking so much that i couldnt hold the rudder properly  i seem to have shouted something and called base  though i knew there was no communication  question  did you try to go back then  bertons answer  no  because finally  when i climbed onto the ceiling  i thought maybe fechner was in one of those holes  i know it sounds nonsensical  still  thats what i thought  if such things happen  i thought  maybe i will be able to find fechner  so i decided to go into as many fog holes as possible  but the third time i went up  after what i saw  i realized that i couldnt make it  i could not  i have to say it is obvious  i got nauseous and vomited in the gondola  i didnt know what that meant until now  ive never been bored  question  it was a symptom of poisoning  berton  bertons answer  possible  i do not know  but what i saw the third time i did not invent  it was not caused by poisoning  question  how can you know about this  bertons response  it wasnt a hallucination  a hallucination is what my own brain produces  right  question  yes  bertons answer  exactly  and he couldnt make it  i will never believe it  he wouldnt be able to do that  question  rather tell me what it was  okay  bertons response  first  i need to know how what ive said so far will be handled  question  what does it matter  bertons answer  for me   essential  i said i saw something i will never forget  if the committee decides that what i said is at least one percent probable  so that appropriate research of this ocean should be started  i think  in this direction  then i will say everything  but if this is to be considered by the committee as some ravings of mine  i wont say anything  question  why  bertons answer  because the content of my hallucinations  even if they cry out to heaven for vengeance  is my private business  but the content of my experience on solaris   no  question  does this mean that you refuse to answer any further questions until a decision has been made by the proper authorities of the expedition  because i think you understand that the committee is not authorized to make an immediate decision  bertons answer  yes  that was the end of the first protocol  there was also a fragment of the second  written eleven days later   chairman     all things considered  a committee of three physicians  three biologists  one mechanical engineer and deputy leader of the expedition  came to the conclusion that the events presented by berton constitute the content of a hallucinatory syndrome  proceeding under the influence of poisoning with the planets atmosphere  with twilight symptoms accompanied by stimulation of the associative zones of the cerebral cortex  and that these or almost nothing  berton  excuse me  what does nothing or   almost nothing mean  what is almost nothing  how big is it  conductor  im not done yet  the votum separatum of physicist archibald messenger has been recorded separately  who stated that what berton said could  in his opinion  happen in reality and is worthy of diligent examination  everything  berton  im repeating a question from a moment ago  leader  its simple   almost nothing  means that certain real phenomena may have triggered your hallucinations  berton  the most normal person on a windy night might mistake a moving bush for a figure  what about on an alien planet when the observers mind is under the influence of poison  that doesnt offend you  berton  what is your decision in this regard  berton  i would like to know first what are the consequences of dr  messengers votum separatum  guide  virtually none  this means that research in this direction will not be undertaken  berton  is what we say recorded  guide  yes  berton  then i would like to say that  in my opinion  the commission failed not to me   i do not count here   but to the spirit of this expedition  as i said the first time  i will not answer further questions  guide  is that all  bernton  yes  but id like to see dr  messenger  is it possible  leader  naturally   that was the end of the second protocol  at the bottom of the sheet was a note in small print stating that dr  messenger had held a confidential conversation with berton the next day for nearly three hours  and then turned to the expedition council  demanding that research on the the pilots testimony  claiming that this was supported by new  additional data that berton had provided to him  but which he would only be able to disclose after the council had reached a positive decision  case closed   the book also contained a photocopy of one page of a letter found in messengers posthumous papers  which was probably a draft  and ravintzer failed to determine whether the letter had been sent or what its consequences were  dullness   the text began  concerned about their authority  the council  specifically shannahan and timolis  because trahiers vote does not count   rejected my demands  i am addressing the institute directly now  but you understand that this is only a powerless protest  bound by word  unfortunately i cannot tell you what berton told me  of course  the councils decision was influenced by the fact that a man without any scientific degree came with the revelation  although many a researcher could envy this pilots presence of mind and talent for observation  please give me the following  data by return mail  1  fechners biography  including his childhood  2  everything you know about his family and family matters  supposedly orphaned a small child  3  the topography of the town where he grew up  i would like to tell you what i think about all this  as you know  some time after the departure of fechner and carucci  a spot appeared in the center of the red sun  which destroyed radio communication with its corpuscular radiation  and according to the sateloid data  mainly in the southern hemisphere  i e  where our base was located  fechner and carrucci were the furthest away from base of all research groups  we did not observe such a thick  persistently resting fog with complete silence until the day of the catastrophe  for the entire time we were on the planet  i believe what berton saw was part of  operation man  by that sticky monster  the actual source of all the creations noticed by berton was fechner   his brain  during some incomprehensible to us  psychological dissection  it was about experimental reconstruction  about reconstructing some  probably the most lasting  traces of his memory  i know it sounds fantastic  i know i could be wrong  so i am asking you for help  i am presently on alaric  and there i shall await your reply  your a   i could barely read  it was so dark  the book turned gray in my hand  and at the end the print began to fall apart before my eyes  but the blank part of the page showed that i had come to the end of this story  which in the light of my own experience i considered very likely  i turned to the window  there was a deep purple in it  a few clouds still smoldering on the horizon like dying coals  the ocean  shrouded in darkness  was invisible  i could hear the faint flutter of paper strips above the fans  the heated air  faintly flavored with ozone  was dead  absolute silence filled the entire station  i thought there was nothing heroic about our decision to stay  the period of heroic planetary struggles  daring expeditions  horrific deaths  such as fechners first ocean victim  was long over  i hardly cared who is the  guest  of   or    after a while  i thought  well stop being ashamed and isolated  if we cant get rid of the  visitors   well get used to them and live with them  and if their maker changes the rules of the game  well adapt to the new ones  though well prance and scurry for a while  and maybe even this or he will commit suicide  but eventually this future state will also come to its equilibrium  the room was filled with darkness more and more earth like  only the white shapes of the washstand and the mirror illuminated the darkness  i lay down on my back on the bed  and somewhere above me  like the flutter of a moth  the whirr of a fan hovered and died away  or far away  in the desert beyond my window  i remembered how terrified i had been last night by the empty gaze of solarian space  and i almost smiled  i wasnt afraid of him  i wasnt afraid of anything  i put my wrist close to my eyes  the dial of the watch lit up with a phosphorescent ring of numbers  the blue sun would rise in an hour  i savored the darkness  breathed deeply  empty  freed from all thought  at one point  as i moved  i felt the flat shape of a tape recorder pressed against my hip  truth     his voice recorded on reels  it didnt even occur to me to resurrect him  to listen to him  it was all i could do for him  i took out the tape recorder to hide it under the bed  i heard a rustle and the faint creak of a door opening    chris     a quiet voice  close to a whisper  sounded    are you here  chris  so dark   its nothing   i said    do not be afraid  come here
