 i sat by the panoramic window  looking at the ocean  there was nothing to do now that the report  which had taken five days to compile  was only a pattern of waves in space  it would be months before a similar pattern would leave earth to create its own line of disturbance in the gravitational field of the galaxy towards the twin suns of solaris 
     under the red sun  the ocean was darker than ever  and the horizon was obscured by a reddish mist  the weather was unusually close  and seemed to be building up towards one of the terrible hurricanes which broke out two or three times a year on the surface of the planet  whose sole inhabitant  it is reasonable to suppose  controlled the climate and willed its storms 
     there were several months to go before i could leave  from my vantage point in the observatory i would watch the birth of the days   a disc of pale gold or faded purple  now and then i would come upon the light of dawn playing among the fluid forms of some edifice risen from the ocean  watch the sun reflected on the silver sphere of a symmetriad  follow the oscillations of the graceful agiluses that curve in the wind  and linger to examine old powdery mimoids 
     and eventually  the screens of all the videophones would start to blink and all the communications equipment would spring to life again  revived by an impulse originating billions of miles away and announcing the arrival of a metal colossus  the  ulysses   or it might be the  prometheus   would land on the station to the piercing whine of its gravitors  and i would go out onto the flat roof to watch the squads of white  heavy duty robots which proceed in all innocence with their tasks  not hesitating to destroy themselves or to destroy the unforeseen obstacle  in strict obedience to the orders echoed into the crystals of their memory  then the ship would rise noiselessly  faster than sound  leaving a sonic boom far behind over the ocean  and every passengers face would light up at the thought of going home 
     what did that word mean to me  earth  i thought of the great bustling cities where i would wander and lose myself  and i thought of them as i had thought of the ocean on the second or third night  when i had wanted to throw myself upon the dark waves  i shall immerse myself among men  i shall be silent and attentive  an appreciative companion  there will be many acquaintances  friends  women   and perhaps even a wife  for a while  i shall have to make a conscious effort to smile  nod  stand and perform the thousands of little gestures which constitute life on earth  and then those gestures will become reflexes again  i shall find new interests and occupations  and i shall not give myself completely to them  as i shall never again give myself completely to anything or anybody  perhaps at night i shall stare up at the dark nebula that cuts off the light of the twin suns  and remember everything  even what i am thinking now  with a condescending  slightly rueful smile i shall remember my follies and my hopes  and this future   will be no less worthy a man than the   of the past  who was prepared for anything in the name of an ambitious enterprise called contact  nor will any man have the right to judge me 
     snow came into the cabin  glanced around  then looked at me again  i went over to the table 
      you wanted me  
      havent you got anything to do  i could give you some work       calculations  not a particularly urgent job       
      thanks   i smiled   you neednt have bothered  
      are you sure  
      yes  i was thinking a few things over  and       
      i wish youd think a little less  
      but you dont know what i was thinking about  tell me something  do you believe in god  
snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction 
 what  who still believes nowadays       
      it isnt that simple  i dont mean the traditional god of earth religion  im no expert in the history of religions  and perhaps this is nothing new   do you happen to know if there was ever a belief in an       imperfect god  
      what do you mean by imperfect   snow frowned   in a way all the gods of the old religions were imperfect  considering that their attributes were amplified human ones  the god of the old testament  for instance  required humble submission and sacrifices  and was jealous of other gods  the greek gods had fits of sulks and family quarrels  and they were just as imperfect as mortals       
      no   i interrupted   im not thinking of a god whose imperfection arises out of the candor of his human creators  but one whose imperfection represents his essential characteristic  a god limited in his omniscience and power  fallible  incapable of foreseeing the consequences of his acts  and creating things that lead to horror  he is a       sick god  whose ambitions exceed his powers and who does not realize it at first  a god who has created clocks  but not the time they measure  he has created systems or mechanisms that served specific ends but have now overstepped and betrayed them  and he has created eternity  which was to have measured his power  and which measures his unending defeat  
     snow hesitated  but his attitude no longer showed any of the wary reserve of recent weeks 
      there was manicheanism       
      nothing at all to do with the principle of good and evil   i broke in 
immediately   this god has no existence outside of matter  he would like to free himself from matter  but he cannot       
     snow pondered for a while 
      i dont know of any religion that answers your description  that kind of religion has never been       necessary  if i understand you  and im afraid i do  what you have in mind is an evolving god  who develops in the course of time  grows  and keeps increasing in power while remaining aware of his powerlessness  for your god  the divine condition is a situation without a goal  and understanding that  he despairs  but isnt this despairing god of yours mankind     it is man you are talking about  and that is a fallacy  not just philosophically but also mystically speaking  
     i kept on 
      no  its nothing to do with man  man may correspond to my provisional definition from some points of view  but that is because the definition has a lot of gaps  man does not create gods  in spite of appearances  the times  the age  impose them on him  man can serve his age or rebel against it  but the target of his cooperation or rebellion comes to him from outside  if there was only a single human being in existence  he would apparently be able to attempt the experiment of creating his own goals in complete freedom   apparently  because a man not brought up among other human beings cannot become a man  and the being   the being i have in mind    cannot exist in the plural  you see  
      oh  then in that case        he pointed out of the window 
      no  not the ocean either  somewhere in its development it has probably come close to the divine state  but it turned back into itself too soon  it is more like an anchorite  a hermit of the cosmos  not a god  it repeats itself  snow  and the being im thinking of would never do that  perhaps he has already been born somewhere  in some corner of the galaxy  and soon he will have some childish enthusiasm that will set him putting out one star and lighting another  we will notice him after a while       
      we already have   snow said sarcastically   novas and supernovas  according to you they are the candles on his altar  
      if youre going to take what i say literally       
      and perhaps solaris is the cradle of your divine child   snow went on  with a widening grin that increased the number of lines round his eyes   solaris could be the first phase of the despairing god  perhaps its intelligence will grow enormously  all the contents of our solarist libraries could be just a record of his teething troubles       
            and we will have been the babys toys for a while  it is possible  and do you know what you have just done  youve produced a completely new hypothesis about solaris   congratulations  everything suddenly falls into place  the failure to achieve contact  the absence of responses  various       lets say various peculiarities in its behavior towards ourselves  everything is explicable in terms of the behaviour of a small child  
      i renounce paternity of the theory   snow grunted  standing at the window 
     for a long instant  we stood staring out at the dark waves  a long pale patch was coming into view to the east  in the mist obscuring the horizon 
without talcing his eyes off the shimmering waste  snow asked abruptly 
      what gave you this idea of an imperfect god  
      i dont know  it seems quite feasible to me  that is the only god i could imagine believing in  a god whose passion is not a redemption  who saves nothing  fulfils no purpose   a god who simply is  
      a mimoid   snow breathed 
      whats that  oh yes  id noticed it  a very old mimoid  
     we both looked towards the misty horizon 
      im going outside   i said abruptly   ive never yet been off the station  and this is a good opportunity  ill be back in half an hour  
     snow raised his eyebrows 
      what  youre going out  where are you going  
     i pointed towards the flesh colored patch half hidden by the mist 
      over there  what is there to stop me  ill take a small helicopter  when i get back to earth i dont want to have to confess that im a solarist who has never set foot on solaris  
     i opened a locker and started rummaging through the atmosphere suits  while snow looked on silently  finally he said 
      i dont like it  
     i had selected a suit  now i turned towards him 
      what   i had not felt so excited for a long time   what are you worrying about  out with it  youre afraid that i       i promise you i have no intention       it never entered my mind  honestly  
      ill go with you  
      thanks  but id rather go alone   i pulled on the suit   do you realize this will be my first flight over the ocean  
     snow muttered something  but i could not make out what  i was in a hurry to get the rest of the gear together 
     he accompanied me to the hangar deck  and helped me drag the flitter out onto the elevator disc  as i was checking my suit  he asked me abruptly 
      can i rely on your word  
      still fretting  yes  you can  where are the oxygen tanks  
     we exchanged no further words  i slid the transparent canopy shut  gave him the signal  and he set the lift going  i emerged onto the station roof  the motor burst into life  the three blades turned and the machine rose   strangely light   into the air  soon the station had fallen far behind 
     alone over the ocean  i saw it with a different eye  i was flying quite low  at about a hundred feet  and for the first time i felt a sensation often described by the explorers but which i had never noticed from the height of the station  the alternating motion of the gleaming waves was not at all like the undulation of the sea or the billowing of clouds  it was like the crawling skin of an animal   the incessant  slow motion contractions of muscular flesh secreting a crimson foam 
     when i started to bank towards the drifting mimoid  the sun shone into my eyes and blood red flashes struck the curved canopy  the dark ocean  flickering with sombre flames  was tinged with blue 
     the flitter came around too wide  and i was carried a long way down wind from the mimoid  a long irregular silhouette looming out of the ocean  emerging from the mist  the mimoid was no longer pink  but a yellowish grey  i lost sight of it momentarily  and glimpsed the station  which seemed to be sitting on the horizon  and whose outline was reminiscent of an ancient zeppelin  i changed course  and the sheer mass of the mimoid grew in my line of vision   a baroque sculpture  i was afraid of crashing into the bulbous swellings  and pulled the flitter up so brutally that it lost speed and started to lurch  but my caution was unnecessary  for the rounded peaks of those fantastic towers were subsiding 
     i flew past the island  and slowly  yard by yard  i descended to the level of the eroded peaks  the mimoid was not large  it measured about three quarters of a mile from end to end  and was a few hundred yards wide  in some places  it was close to splitting apart  this mimoid was obviously a fragment of a far larger formation  on the scale of solaris it was only a tiny splinter  weeks or perhaps months old 
     among the mottled crags overhanging the ocean  i found a kind of beach  a sloping  fairly even surface a few yards square  and steered towards it  the rotors almost hit a cliff that reared up suddenly in my path  but i landed safely  cut the motor and slid back the canopy  standing on the fuselage i made sure that there was no chance of the flitter sliding into the ocean  waves were licking at the jagged bank about fifteen paces away  but the machine rested solidly on its legs  and i jumped to the ground 
     the cliff i had almost hit was a huge bony membrane pierced with holes  and full of knotty swellings  a crack several yards wide split this wall diagonally and enabled me to examine the interior of the island  already glimpsed through the apertures in the membrane  i edged warily onto the nearest ledge  but my boots showed no tendency to slide and the suit did not impede my movements  and i went on climbing until i had reached a height of about four storeys above the ocean  and could see a broad stretch of petrified landscape stretching back until it was lost from sight in the depths of the mimoid 
     it was like looking at the ruins of an ancient town  a moroccan city tens of centuries old  convulsed by an earthquake or some other disaster  i made out a tangled web of winding sidestreets choked with debris  and alleyways which fell abruptly towards the oily foam that floated close to the shore  in the middle distance  great battlements stood intact  sustained by ossified buttresses  there were dark openings in the swollen  sunken walls   traces of windows or loop holes  the whole of this floating town canted to one side or another like a foundering ship  pitched and turned slowly  and the sun cast continually moving shadows  which crept among the ruined alleys  now and again a polished surface caught and reflected the light  i took the risk of climbing higher  then stopped  rivulets of fine sand were beginning to trickle down the rocks above my head  cascading into ravines and alleyways and rebounding in swirling clouds of dust  the mimoid is not made of stone  and to dispel the illusion one only has to pick up a piece of it  it is lighter than pumice  and composed of small  very porous cells 
     now i was high enough to feel the swaying of the mimoid  it was moving forward  propelled by the dark muscles of the ocean towards an unknown destination  but its inclination varied  it rolled from side to side  and the languid oscillation was accompanied by the gentle rustling sound of the yellow and grey foam which streamed off the emerging shore  the mimoid had acquired its swinging motion long before  probably at its birth  and even while it grew and broke up it had retained its initial pattern 
     only now did i realize that i was not in the least concerned with the mimoid  and that i had flown here not to explore the formation but to acquaint myself with the ocean 
     with the flitter a few paces behind me  i sat on the rough  fissured beach  a heavy black wave broke over the edge of the bank and spread out  not black  but a dirty green  the ebbing wave left viscous streamlets behind  which flowed back quivering towards the ocean  i went closer  and when the next wave came i held out my hand  what followed was a faithful reproduction of a phenomenon which had been analyzed a century before  the wave hesitated  recoiled  then enveloped my hand without touching it  so that a thin covering of air separated my glove inside a cavity which had been fluid a moment previously  and now had a fleshy consistency  i raised my hand slowly  and the wave  or rather an outcrop of the wave  rose at the same time  enfolding my hand in a translucent cyst with greenish reflections  i stood up  so as to raise my hand still higher  and the gelatinous substance stretched like a rope  but did not break  the main body of the wave remained motionless on the shore  surrounding my feet without touching them  like some strange beast patiently waiting for the experiment to finish  a flower had grown out of the ocean  and its calyx was moulded to my fingers  i stepped back  the stem trembled  stirred uncertainly and fell back into the wave  which gathered it and receded 
     i repeated the game several times  until   as the first experimenter had observed   a wave arrived which avoided me indifferently  as if bored with a too familiar sensation  i knew that to revive the curiosity of the ocean i would have to wait several hours  disturbed by the phenomenon i had stimulated  i sat down again  although i had read numerous accounts of it  none of them had prepared me for the experience as i had lived it  and i felt somehow changed 
     in all their movements  taken together or singly  each of these branches reaching out of the ocean seemed to display a kind of cautious but not feral alertness  a curiosity avid for quick apprehension of a new  unexpected form  and regretful at having to retreat  unable to exceed the limits set by a mysterious law  the contrast was inexpressible between that lively curiosity and the shimmering immensity of the ocean that stretched away out of sight       i had never felt its gigantic presence so strongly  or its powerful changeless silence  or the secret forces that gave the waves their regular rise and fall  i sat unseeing  and sank into a universe of inertia  glided down an irresistible slope and identified myself with the dumb  fluid colossus  it was as if i had forgiven it everything  without the slightest effort of word or thought 
     during that last week  i had been behaving so normally that snow had stopped keeping a watchful eye on me  on the surface  i was calm  in secret  without really admitting it  i was waiting for something  her return  how could i have been waiting for that  we all know that we are material creatures  subject to the laws of physiology and physics  and not even the power of all our feelings combined can defeat those laws  all we can do is detest them  the age old faith of lovers and poets in the power of love  stronger than death  that  finis vitae sed non amoris   is a lie  useless and not even funny  so must one be resigned to being a clock that measures the passage of time  now out of order  now repaired  and whose mechanism generates despair and love as soon as its maker sets it going  are we to grow used to the idea that every man relives ancient torments  which are all the more profound because they grow comic with repetition  that human existence should repeat itself  well and good  but that it should repeat itself like a hackneyed tune  or a record a drunkard keeps playing as he feeds coins into the jukebox      
     that liquid giant had been the death of hundreds of men  the entire human race had tried in vain to establish even the most tenuous link with it  and it bore my weight without noticing me any more than it would notice a speck of dust  i did not believe that it could respond to the tragedy of two human beings  yet its activities did have a purpose       true  i was not absolutely certain  but leaving would mean giving up a chance  perhaps an infinitesimal one  perhaps only imaginary       must i go on living here then  among the objects we both had touched  in the air she had breathed  in the name of what  in the hope of her return  i hoped for nothing  and yet i lived in expectation  since she had gone  that was all that remained  i did not know what achievements  what mockery  even what tortures still awaited me  i knew nothing  and i persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past
