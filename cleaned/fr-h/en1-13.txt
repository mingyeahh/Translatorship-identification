another three weeks  the shutters rose and fell on time  i was still a prisoner in my nightmares  and every morning the play began again  but was it a play  i put on a feigned composure  and rheya played the same game  the deception was mutual and deliberate  and our agreement only contributed to our ultimate evasion  we talked about the future  and our life on earth on the outskirts of some great city  we would spend the rest of our lives among green trees and under a blue sky  and never leave earth again  together we planned the lay out of our house and garden and argued over details like the location of a hedge or a bench 
     i do not believe that i was sincere for a single instant  our plans were impossible  and i knew it  for even if rheya could leave the station and survive the voyage  how could i have got through the immigration checks with my clandestine passenger  earth admits only human beings  and even then only when they carry the necessary papers  rheya would be detained for an identity check at the first barrier  we would be separated  and she would give herself away at once  the station was the one place where we could live together  rheya must have known that  or found it out 
     one night i heard rheya get out of bed silently  i wanted to stop her  in the darkness and silence we occasionally managed to throw off our despair for a while by making each other forget  rheya did not notice that i had woken up  when i stretched my hand out  she was already out of bed  and walking bare foot towards the door  without daring to raise my voice  i whispered her name  but she was outside  and a narrow shaft of light shone through the doorway from the corridor 
     there was a sound of whispering  rheya was talking to somebody       but whom  panic overtook me when i tried to stand up  and my legs would not move  i listened  but heard nothing  the blood hammered through my temples  i started counting  and was approaching a thousand when there was a movement in the doorway and rheya returned  she stood there for a second without moving  and i made myself breathe evenly 
          she whispered 
     i did not answer 
     she slid quickly into bed and lay down  taking care not to disturb me  questions buzzed in my mind  but i would not let myself be the first to speak  and made no move  the silent questioning went on for an hour  maybe more  then i fell asleep 
     the morning was like any other  i watched rheya furtively  but could not see any change in her behavior  after breakfast  we sat at the big panoramic window  the station was hovering among purple clouds  rheya was reading  and as i stared out i suddenly noticed that by holding my head at a certain angle i could see us both reflected in the window  i took my hand off the rail  rheya had no idea that i was watching her  she glanced at me  obviously decided from my posture that i was looking at the ocean  then bent to kiss the place where my hand had rested  in a moment she was reading her book again 
      rheya   i asked gently   where did you go last night  
      last night  
      yes  
      you       you must have been dreaming     i didnt go anywhere  
      you didnt leave the cabin  
      no  it must have been a dream  
      perhaps       yes  perhaps i dreamt it  
     the same evening  i started talking about our return to earth again  but rheya stopped me 
      dont talk to me about the journey again     i dont want to hear any more about it  you know very well       
      what  
      no  nothing  
     after we went to bed  she said that she was thirsty 
      theres a glass of fruit juice on the table over there  could you give it to me   she drank half of it then handed it to me 
      im not thirsty  
      drink to my health then   she smiled 
     it tasted slightly bitter  but my mind was on other things  she switched the light off 
      rheya       if you wont talk about the voyage  lets talk about something else  
      if i did not exist  would you marry  
      no  
      never  
      never  
      why not  
      i dont know  i was by myself for ten years and i didnt marry again  lets not talk about that        my head was spinning as if i had been drinking too much 
      no  lets talk about it  what if i begged you to  
      to marry again  dont be silly  rheya  i dont need anybody except you  
     i felt her breath on my face and her arms holding me 
      say it another way  
      i love you  
     her head fell to my shoulder  and i felt tears 
      rheya  whats the matter  
      nothing       nothing       nothing        her voice echoed into silence  and my eyes closed 
     the red dawn woke me with a splitting head and a neck so stiff that i felt as if the bones were welded together  my tongue was swollen  and my mouth felt foul  then i reached out for rheya  and my hand touched a cold sheet 
     i sat up with a start 
     i was alone   alone in bed and in the cabin  the concave window reflected a row of red suns  i dragged myself out of bed and staggered over to the bathroom  reeling like a drunkard and propping myself up on the furniture  it was empty  so was the workshop 
      rheya  
     calling  running up and down the corridor 
      rheya   i screamed  one last time  then my voice gave out  i already knew the truth   
   
     i do not remember the exact sequence of events after that  as i stumbled half naked through all the length and breadth of the station  it seems to me that i even went into the refrigeration section  searched through the storage rooms  hammered with my fists on bolted doors  then came back again to throw myself against doors which had already resisted me  i half fell down flights of steps  picked myself up and hurried onwards  when i reached the double armoured doors which opened onto the ocean i was still calling  still hoping that it was a dream  somebody was standing by me  hands took hold of me and pulled me away 
     i came to my senses again lying on a metal table in the little workshop and gasping for breath  my throat and nostrils were burning with some alcoholic vapor  my shirt was soaked in water  and my hair plastered over my skull 
     snow was busy at a medicine cupboard  shifting instruments and glass vessels which clattered with an unbearable din  then his face appeared  looking gravely down into my eyes 
      where is she  
      she is not here  
      but       rheya       
     he bent over me  brought his face closer  and spoke very slowly and clearly 
      rheya is dead  
      she will come back   i whispered 
     instead of dreading her return  i wanted it  i did not attempt to remind myself why i myself had once tried to drive her away  and why i had been so afraid of her return 
      drink this  
     snow held out a glass  and i threw it in his face  he staggered back  rubbing his eyes  and by the time he opened them again i was on my feet and standing over him  how small he was      
      it was you  
      what do you mean  
      come on snow  you know what i mean  it was you who met her the other night  you told her to give me a sleeping pill       what has happened to her  tell me  
     he felt in his shirt pocket and took out an envelope  i snatched it out of his hand  it was sealed  and there was no inscription  inside was a sheet of paper folded twice  and i recognized the sprawling  rather childish handwriting 
  
       my darling  i was the one who asked him  he is a good man  i am sorry i had to lie to you  i beg you to give me this one wish   hear him out  and do nothing to harm yourself  you have been marvellous   
  
     there was one more word  which she had crossed out  but i could see that she had signed  rheya  
     my mind was now absolutely clear  even if i had wanted to scream hysterically  my voice had gone  and i did not even have the strength to groan 
      how         
      later     youve got to calm down  
      im calm now  tell me how  
      disintegration  
      but       what did you use  
      the roche apparatus was unsuitable    built something else  a new destabilizer  a miniature instrument  with a range of a few yards  
      and she       
      she disappeared  a pop  and a puff of air  thats all  
      a short range instrument       
      yes  we didnt have the resources for anything bigger  
     the walls loomed over me  and i shut my eyes 
      she will come back  
      no  
      what do you know about it  
      you remember the wings of foam  since that day  they do not come back  
      you killed her   i whispered 
      yes       in my place  what else would you have done  
     i turned away from him and began pacing up and down the room  nine steps to the corner  about turn   nine more rapid steps  and i was facing snow again 
      listen  well write a report  well ask for an immediate link with the council  its feasible  and theyll accept   they must  the planet will no longer be subject to the four power convention  well be authorized to use any means at our disposal  we can send for anti matter generators  nothing can stand up against them  nothing        i was shouting now  and blinded with tears 
      you want to destroy it  why  
      get out  leave me alone  
      no  i wont get out  
      snow   i glared at him  and he shook his head   what do you want  what am i supposed to do   he walked back to the table 
      fine  well draw up a report  
     i started pacing again 
      sit down  
      ill do what i like  
      there are two distinct questions  one  the facts  two  our recommendations  
      do we have to talk about it now  
      yes  now  
      i wont listen  you hear  im not interested in your distinctions  
      we sent our last message about two months ago  before  s death  well have to establish exactly how the visitor phenomena function       
     i grabbed his arm 
      will you shut up  
      hit me if you like  but i will not shut up  
      oh  talk away  if it gives you pleasure        i let him go 
 good  listen    will want to conceal certain facts  im almost certain of it  
 and what about you  wont you conceal anything  
      no  not now  this business goes further than individual responsibilities  you know that as well as i do 
     it has given a demonstration of considered activity  it is capable of carrying out organic synthesis on the most complex level  a synthesis we ourselves have never managed to achieve  it knows the structure  micro structure and metabolism of our bodies       
      all right       but why stop there  it has performed a series of       experiments on us  psychic vivisection  it has used knowledge which it stole from our minds without our consent  
      those are not facts     they are not even propositions  they are theories  you could say that it has taken account of desires locked into secret recesses of our brains  perhaps it was sending us       presents  
      presents  my god   i shook with a fit of uncontrollable laughter 
      take it easy   snow took hold of my hand  and i tightened my grip until i heard bones cracking  he went on looking at me without any change of expression  i let go  and walked over to a corner of the workshop 
      ill try to get hold of myself  
      yes  of course  i understand  what do we ask them  
      i leave it to you       i cant think straight right now  did she say anything   before  
      no  nothing  if you want my opinion  from now on we stand a chance  
      a chance  what chance   i stared at him  and light suddenly 
dawned   contact  still contact  havent you had enough of this madhouse  what more do you need  no  its out of the question  count me out  
      why not   he asked quietly   you yourself instinctively treat it like a human being  now more than ever  you hate it  
      and you dont  
      no     it is blind     i thought that i might not have heard him correctly        
  or rather it sees in a different way from ourselves  we do not exist for it in the same sense that we exist for each other  we recognize one another by the appearance of the face and the body  that appearance is a transparent window to the ocean  it introduces itself directly into the brain  
      right  what if it does  what are you driving at  it succeeded in recreating a human being who exists only in my memory  and so accurately that her eyes  her gestures  her voice       
      dont stop  talk  
      im talking       her voice       because it is able to read us like a book  you see what i 
mean  
      yes  that it could make itself understood  
      doesnt that follow  
      no  not necessarily  perhaps it used a formula which is not expressed in verbal terms  it may be taken from a recording imprinted on our minds  but a mans memory is stored in terms of nucleic acids etching asynchronous large moleculed crystals  it removed the deepest  most isolated imprint  the most assimilated structure  without necessarily knowing what it meant to us  suppose  im capable of reproducing the architecture of a symmetriad  and i know its composition and have the requisite technology       i create a symmetriad and i drop it into the ocean  but i dont know why im doing so  i dont know its function  and i dont know what the symmetriad means to the ocean       
      yes  you may be right  in that case it wished us no harm  and it was not trying to destroy us  yes  its possible       and with no intention       
     my mouth began to tremble 
         
      all right  dont get worried  you are kind  the ocean is kind  everybody is kind  but why  explain that  why has it done this  what did you say       to her  
      the truth  
 i asked you what you said  
 you know very well  come back to my cabin and well write out the report  come 
on  
      wait  what exactly do you want  you cant be intending to remain on the station         yes  i want to stay
