i lay on my back with  s head in the crook of my shoulder  thinking of nothing  the darkness was filling in  i could hear footsteps  something was building up above me  higher and higher  endlessly  the night  the night pierced me through and through  the night took possession of me  it enveloped me and penetrated me  impalpable  inconsistent  i was petrified and could not breathe  there was no air to breathe  far away i could hear my heart beating  i gathered my remaining strength  my full attention  and waited for the agony  i waited    i shrank  and the invisible  horizonless sky  the formless  cloudless  starless space receded  expanded and grew around me  i tried to crawl onto my bed  but there was no bed  the darkness no longer covered anything  i pressed my hands against my face  i had no fingers  no hands  i wanted to scream  to shout    the room floated in a blue half light  which surrounded the furniture  the shelves full of books  which erased the colour of the walls and of everything  a pearly whiteness shone through the window  i was drenched in sweat  i glanced sideways    was looking at me  she raised her head   is your arm numb  the colour of her eyes had faded too  they were grey   bright  though  under the black lashes    what is it    i felt her whisper like a caress  before i understood the meaning of the words    no   i said at last  ah  yes   i said at last  i put my hand on her shoulder  my fingers were tingling  she asked 

   did you have a bad dream  i drew her in with my other hand   a dream  yes  i was dreaming  and you  did you not sleep    i dont know  i dont think so  i didnt sleep  you mustnt let that stop you from sleeping    why are you looking at me like that  i closed my eyes  his heart was beating against my heart  his heart  just an accessory  i thought  but nothing surprised me anymore  not even my own indifference  i had crossed the boundaries of fear and despair  i had come so far   no one had ever come so far  my lips brushed her neck  i went down to the cavity between the tendons  blood was hitting the wall of the silky flesh shell  i leaned on my elbow  dawn  sweetness of the dawn  a silent storm was burning the cloudless horizon  a flash of lightning  the first ray of blue sunshine  flashed across the room and broke into sharp reflections  there was a crossfire of sparks  from the mirror  from the door handles  from the nickel plated pipes  the light scattered  threw itself on every smooth surface and seemed to want to conquer a larger space  to burst the room  i looked at    the pupils of her grey eyes had contracted  she asked in a dull voice   is the night over yet    the night never lasts long here    what about us    what about us    how long will we stay here  coming from her  the question was not lacking in comical flavour  but when i spoke  my voice revealed no trace of mirth    quite a long time  probably  you dont want to stay  she did not blink  she was looking at me intently  did she blink now  i wasnt sure  she pulled back the blanket and i saw the little pink triangle on her arm    why are you looking at me like that    because youre beautiful 

 she smiled  without malice  she was discreetly thanking me for my compliment    really  its as if    its as if      what    as if you were doubting something    what an idea    as if you were suspicious of me  as if i had hidden something from you      nonsense    the way you deny it  i can see im not wrong  the light was becoming blinding  with my hand in my visor  i looked for my glasses  they were on the table  i knelt down  stretched out my arm and put on the black glasses  when i lay down beside her    smiled   what about me  i suddenly realised    glasses  i got up and started to rummage around  i opened drawers  i moved books  instruments    i found two pairs of glasses  which i gave to    i found two pairs of glasses  which i gave to    she tried them on  one pair after the other  the glasses were too big  they fell to the middle of her nose  the shutters creaked as they slid past the window  and it was night again  i groped to help   remove his glasses and put them under the bed  she asked   what are we doing    we sleep at night           what    do you want a compress on your forehead    no  thank you  thank you    my darling  i dont know why i added those two words  in the darkness i grasped her graceful shoulders  felt them quiver  and felt sure that i was holding   in my arms  or rather  i suddenly realised that she was not trying to fool me  it was i who was fooling her   for she sincerely believed that she was   

 then i dozed off several times  and each time i was startled out of my sleep  panting  exhausted  i held on to her  my heart was slowly calming  with her fingertips  carefully  she touched my cheeks  my forehead  to check that i had no fever  it was    the only one  the real    something changed in me  i stopped struggling and almost immediately fell asleep  a pleasant cool sensation woke me up  my face was covered with a damp cloth  which i easily removed  and i saw   bending over me  she smiled at me  with both hands she was pressing a piece of gauze  which was dripping into a porcelain basin  beside the basin was a bottle of healing lotion    what a sleep   she said  applying the compress she had just prepared to my temple    does it hurt    no  i wrinkled my forehead  i wrinkled my forehead  the skin was supple again    was sitting on the edge of the bed  her black hair thrown back over the collar of a bathrobe  a mans dressing gown  with orange and white stripes  whose sleeves she had rolled up to the elbow  i was terribly hungry  it had been at least twenty hours since my last meal  when   had finished her nursing  i stood up and looked at two dresses draped over the back of an armchair   two identical white dresses  each with a row of red buttons  i had torn one of the dresses myself  to help   leave it  and   had come back last night wearing the second dress  i had to undo the seam with scissors   she said  i think the zip got stuck  the sight of the two identical dresses was beyond anything i had ever seen before    was busy tidying up the little pharmacy  i turned away and bit my fist  continuing to stare at the two dresses   or rather  the one duplicate dress   i walked away towards

 the door  the water was running noisily from the tap  i opened the door  slipped out of the room  and carefully closed the panel  i could hear the murmur of water  the clink of bottles  suddenly all noise ceased  i waited with clenched jaws  the door panel reflected one of the luminous tubes which surrounded the ceiling of the rotunda  i held the handle  without much conviction that i could keep it up  a sudden jolt almost tore it from my hand  but the door did not open  it vibrated and shook from top to bottom  stunned  i let go of the handle and stepped back  the plastic panel was hollowing out  as if an unseen figure beside me had tried to break down the door and enter the room  the steel frame of the panel became more and more arched and the enamel was crumbling  suddenly i realised that instead of pushing the door open    was trying to open it by pulling it towards himself  the reflection of the light tube bent in the distorting mirror of the white panel  a loud crack sounded and the panel  stretched to the limit  split open  simultaneously  the handle disappeared  torn from its mount  bloody hands passed through the crack  came forward leaving red marks on the milky varnish  and the door broke into two pieces hanging at an angle from their hinges  a pale face appeared  a haggard creature in an orange and white bathrobe rushed to my chest  sobbing  i wanted to flee  too late and against all hope  but i was unable to move    was breathing convulsively  her dishevelled head was pounding on my shoulder  when i could reach out to restrain her    collapsed  avoiding the broken panel  i carried her into the room and laid her on the bed  her skinned fingertips had broken nails  when she turned her hand over  i saw the bones of her palm protruding  i looked at her face  the expressionless eyes did not see me       she answered with an inarticulate grunt  i put a finger to her eye  the lid closed 


 i moved towards the pharmacy  the bed creaked  i turned around    was sitting up and looking down at her bloody hands in horror        she moaned   i    i    what happened to me  i answered curtly   you hurt yourself when you broke down the door  my lips itched oddly  especially my lower lip  which i clamped between my teeth    looked for a moment at the pieces of the plastic panel hanging from the steel frame  then looked at me again  she tried to hide the terror that had overtaken her  but i could see that her chin was trembling  i cut up some gauze squares  took a jar of antiseptic powder and returned to the bed  the glass jar slipped out of my hand and broke  but i didnt need it anymore  i lifted  s hand  the fingernails  still surrounded by a trickle of curdled blood  had grown back  a pink scar ran down the palm  and the scar was fading  fading fast  i sat down  caressed his face  and tried to smile   without much success    why did you do this       was it me  with her eyes she pointed to the door    yes    dont you remember    no    i mean  i realised you were gone  i got very scared  and      and what    i looked for you  i thought you might be in the bathroom    only then did i notice that the sliding wardrobe  hiding the entrance to the bathroom  had been pushed back    then    i ran to the door    then    i forgot    something must have happened      what 

   i dont know    what do you remember later    i was sitting here on the bed    dont you remember me carrying you here  the corner of her lips drooped  her face worried  she hesitated   it seems to me    its possible    i dont know  she swung her legs over the edge of the bed  stood up and went to the broken door       coming up behind her  i grabbed her shoulders  she was shaking  she suddenly turned and whispered             calm down       if its me       am i epileptic  epilepsy   goodness gracious  she definitely had some funny questions    what an idea  my dear  we left the room just as the window shutter creaked up and the blue sun was sinking into the ocean  i led   to the small kitchen on the other side of the rotunda  together we raided the cupboards and fridges  i soon found that   was not much better at cooking or opening cans than i was  i devoured the contents of two cans and drank countless cups of coffee    also ate  as children sometimes do when they are not hungry and do not want to displease their parents  or rather  she did not force herself to eat  she took in the food automatically  with indifference  after the meal we went to the operating room  adjacent to the radio booth  i had my plan  i told   that i wanted to do a medical examination   just to check his general condition   and i put him in a mechanical chair  i removed a syringe and needles from the steriliser  i knew where everything was  the instructors had left no stone unturned during the training course in

 inside the model of the station    held out his fingers  i took a drop of blood  i spread the blood on a glass plate and placed it on the bottom of the exhauster  then i put the plate in a vacuum tank and rained down a shower of silver ions  i felt better  the gestures of familiar work had a calming effect  lying on the cushions of the mechanical chair    gazed at the equipment in the operating theatre  the hum of the telephone filled the silence  i lifted the receiver       i watched    she remained unmoved  she seemed exhausted by her recent adventure  i heard a sigh of relief    finally  it was    i waited with the earpiece pressed to my ear    you have a visit  dont you    yes    are you busy    yes    a little check up  eh    do you mind  did you want to play a game of chess    dont get upset       wants to meet you  he wants the three of us to meet  surprised  i replied    very kind of him  but      i paused  then continued   is he alone    i interrupted  then resumed   is he alone    no    i misspoke  i misspoke  he would like to talk with us  well connect the three video telephones to the same line  the image transmission lenses will be blocked    ah  why didnt he call me himself  am i intimidating him    possibly     grumbled  whats up    a conference    in an hour  will that do    thats fine  i could see him on the screen   only the face  no bigger than my fist  for a moment he looked at me intently 

 i could hear the crackle of the electric current  then sna ut spoke  with some hesitation    how are you getting on    not too bad  how about you    a bit worse than you  i suppose    could i      would you like to come to my place  i looked over my shoulder at    she was lying cross legged  her head tilted forward  her face sullen as she played mechanically with the little chrome ball that ended a chain attached to the arm of the chair   s voice rang out   leave it alone  you hear  im telling you to leave it alone  i could see his profile on the screen  i couldnt hear anything   he had covered the microphone with his hand   but his lips were moving    no  i cant come   he said quickly  maybe later  ill call you in an hour anyway  the screen went blank  i hung up the receiver    who was that   asked    without showing any curiosity       a cyberneticist    you dont know him    how much longer is this going to take    are you bored  i put the first plate of the series in the neutrinic microscope case and  one after the other  i pressed the different coloured switches  the magnetic fields rumbled dully    there are not many distractions here  and if my modest company is not enough for you    i spoke absentmindedly  prolonging the intervals between words  i drew the big black helmet that flared around the microscope to me and pressed my forehead against the elastic foam of the visor  i heard  s voice  but i did not understand what it said  my gaze looked out over a huge desert flooded with silver light  dotted with rounded rocky patches   red globules   that quivered and shook behind a veil of mist  i put the

 i brought the telescope into focus and looked deeper into the fiery landscape  without taking my eyes off the visor  i turned the orientation crank  when a sliver of rock  an isolated globule  was at the crossroads of the black threads  i enlarged the image  the lens had apparently encountered a deformed erythrocyte  collapsed in the middle  and its jagged edges cast sharp black shadows into the depths of a circular crater  the crater  bristling with silver ion deposits  escaped the microscopes field of vision  the nebulous contours of atrophied and distorted albumin chains appeared within an opalescent liquid  a coil of albumin folded back at the crossroads of the black threads of the lens  slowly  progressively  i operated the magnification lever  any moment now i should have reached the end of this exploration of the abyss  the shadow of a molecule occupied the whole space  then the image became blurred    nothing  however  showed itself  i should have seen the vibrating cloud of atoms   i saw nothing  the screen glowed immaculately  i pushed the lever all the way in  the irritated humming grew louder  i still could see nothing  an alarm signal sounded and repeated itself  the circuit was overloaded  one last time i looked out over the silvery desert and cut the power  i looked at    she gave a yawn  which she deftly changed into a smile  she asked   am i in good health    excellent  youre doing very well  as well as can be expected  i continued to look at her and again felt a bug running through my lower lip  what exactly had happened  what did it mean  was this body  weak and fragile in appearance   indestructible in reality   finally made of nothing  i banged my fist against the cylinder of the microscope  a defect in the apparatus  a bad concentration of magnetic fields  no  i knew that the device was working perfectly  i had gone through all the levels   the cells  the albumin conglomerates  the molecules   and everything was similar to what i had already observed


 on thousands of preparations  but the last step into the material had led me nowhere  i made a ligature in harvey  i took the blood from a median vein and transferred it to a graduated glass vessel  i then divided it between several test tubes and began the analysis  this work required more time than i had expected  i was a little out of practice  the reactions were normal  all the reactions    i dropped a drop of frozen acid on a coral bead  smoke  the blood turned grey and was covered with a layer of dirty foam  decay  decomposition  further  further  i turned away to take a second test tube  when my eye returned to the experiment in progress  i almost dropped the thin glass tube  beneath the layer of dirty scum  a dark coral was growing  the blood  destroyed by the acid  was being recreated  it was absurd  impossible         i could hear my name  from a great distance       the phone    what  oh  yes  thank you  ah  yes  thank you  the phone had been ringing for a long time  i only realised it at that moment  i lifted the receiver            all three of us are connected to the same line   s high pitched voice rang through the receiver    greetings  dr      the cautious  deceptively confident voice of the speaker who has ventured onto a crumbling platform  i replied    greetings  dr     i felt like laughing  but i didnt know if i could afford to give in to a mirth whose causes remained unclear  after all  who was there to laugh at  i had a test tube of blood in my hand  i shook it  the blood had clotted  perhaps  a few moments earlier  i had been the victim of an illusion  perhaps i had been mistaken 

   i wanted to tell you  dear colleagues  about some questions concerning    ghosts  i heard   and yet my mind refused to take in his words  i looked at the clotted blood at the bottom of the test tube and fought against the voice that tried to force my attention    lets call them f creations     said quickly    ah  yes  very good  a vertical line  barely perceptible in the middle of the screen  indicated that i was connected to two channels  separated by this line  i should have seen two images     and    but the screen  framed by a bright border  remained dark  both of my interlocutors had covered the lens of their cameras    each of us had carried out various experiments    always the same caution in the nasal voice  a silence    i suggest that we first exchange the knowledge we have acquired   continued    then i will venture to communicate the conclusions i have reached personally  i suddenly felt   looking at me  i put my hand on the table and rolled the test tube under the racks of utensils  then i perched myself on top of a high stool  which i had pulled up with my foot  i was about to recuse myself  when  to my own astonishment  i heard myself reply   fine  a little chat  i didnt do much  but i can talk about it  a histological preparation and some reactions  microreactions  i have the impression that      i didnt know what to say  suddenly  a valve opened and i resumed  everything is normal  but its a camouflage  a mask  in a certain sense  its a super copy  a reproduction superior to the original  let me explain  whereas in humans there is a fundamental limit   a term to structural divisibility   here the boundaries are pushed back  we are dealing with an infra atomic framework    just a moment  just a moment  could you elaborate on this   asked   

   said nothing  was that the echo of his hurried breathing that i heard    was looking at me again  i realised that in my excitement i had almost shouted the last words  calmed  i settled back on my uncomfortable perch and closed my eyes  how can i be more precise    the atom is the ultimate building block of our body  i suppose that f creations are made up of units smaller than ordinary atoms  much smaller    mesons   insinuated    he was not at all surprised    no  not mesons    i would have seen them  i would have seen them  the power of my device down here is a tenth to a twentieth of an angstrom  isnt it  but you cant see anything  nothing at all  so they are not mesons  they are neutrinos    how do you make this assumption  neutrino conglomerates are not stable      i dont know  im not a physicist  perhaps a magnetic field can stabilise them  i dont know the question  in any case  if my observations are correct  the edifice is made up of particles ten thousand times smaller than atoms  wait  i havent finished  if albumin molecules and cells were made up directly from these micro atoms  they would have to be proportionately smaller  so would the globules  and the ferments  everything  but the dimensions are those of the structures of atoms  therefore  albumin  cell  cell nucleus  everything is a mask  the real structure  which controls the functioning of the  visitor   remains hidden deeper         had just stifled a scream  i paused in horror  i had said visitor    had not heard me  besides  she wouldnt have understood  she was looking out of the window with her head in her hand  and the purple dawn was around her delicate profile  my distant interlocutors were silent  i could hear them breathing 

   theres something to remember in this   muttered      yes   remarked     but one thing stops us  the hypothetical   particles do not constitute the structure of the ocean  the ocean is a structure of atoms  i replied    it may be able to produce neutrinos    i suddenly lost interest in what they were saying  the conversation was pointless   and not even funny     s hypothesis would explain this extraordinary resistance and the speed of regeneration    grumbled  moreover  they probably carry an energy source inside them  they dont need to eat      i demand the floor   cut in      the horrifying chairman of the debate was holding fast to the role he had assigned himself    i would like to raise the question of the motivation for the appearance of f creations  i would introduce the question in the following way  what are f creations  they are not autonomous individuals  nor copies of determined individuals  they are merely materialized projections of the contents of our brain  on the theme of a given individual  the accuracy of this definition struck me    was not sympathetic  but he was not stupid either  i took part in the conversation again    i think you are right  i think you are right  your definition would explain why this per    creation appeared  rather than that other one  materialization originates in the most durable imprints of memory  particularly differentiated imprints  no single imprint  however  can be completely isolated  in the course of reproduction  fragments of contiguous imprints have been absorbed  consequently  the newcomer sometimes reveals more extensive knowledge than that of the authentic individual whose copy he is          shouted   again  only   reacted to my vocabulary deviations    didnt seem to mind  did this mean that   visitor was less perceptive by nature than the

   s visitor  for a second i imagined the learned dr   flanked by a stunted moron    indeed  that fits with our observations   said    now lets consider the motivation for the appearance  it is quite natural to assume  in the first place  that we are the object of an experiment  if i examine this thesis  the experiment seems to me to be poorly conducted  when we conduct an experiment  we take advantage of the results obtained and  above all  we carefully record the failures of our experimental system  as a result  we subsequently introduce changes to our way of doing things  in this case  however  no changes are made  the f creations reappear as they were  without any correction    as helpless as before  every time we try to    get rid of them    i decided    well  return fire without a correction device  as dr   would say  conclusions    simply that the thesis of the experiment does not sit well with this    this implausible mess  the ocean is    precise  the double level structure of the f creations testifies to this precision  within certain limits  the f creations behave in the same way as the real    the    he couldnt get out of it    the originals     gasped    yes  the originals  but when the situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the    er    original  the f creation undergoes a sort of disconnection of consciousness  immediately followed by different  inhuman manifestations      thats right  i said  and we can have fun cataloguing the behaviour of    these creations   a perfectly fruitless occupation    im not sure   protested      i suddenly understood why he irritated me so much  he didnt talk  he

 he wasnt talking  he was talking  as if he had been sitting in a session of the institute  apparently he could not express himself otherwise    there is a question of individuality here   he continued   which i am sure the ocean has no idea about  i believe that the    er    delicate aspect  the shocking aspect of our present condition  escapes his comprehension completely    you think his actions are not premeditated  i had been somewhat taken aback by  s point of view  on reflection  i recognised that it was difficult to exclude it    no  unlike our colleague    i do not believe in any perfidy  any malice  any cruel intention      raised his voice    i do not lend him human feelings  but i try to explain to myself these continual returns  with a secret desire to annoy    i said   perhaps they are connected to a device that goes round and round like a record    please  dear colleagues  lets not spread ourselves too thin  i have not finished  under normal circumstances  i would have considered it premature to present a report  even a provisional one  on the state of my work  in view of the particular situation  i believe i can speak  i have the impression   an impression  i would add   that dr  s hypothesis is not without merit  i am referring to the hypothesis of a neutrino structure    our knowledge in this area is purely theoretical  we did not know that there was a possibility of stabilising such structures  we now have a clearly defined way out  the means of neutralising the magnetic field that stabilises the structure    for some time i had been noticing light rays on the screen  a large slit lit up the left half of the receiver from top to bottom and i saw a pink object moving slowly  the shutter slipped again and flew off    gave a heart rending cry   go away  go away  i saw  s hands and forearms  protected by large laboratory sleeves  struggle  a golden disc suddenly shone  and then everything faded away  only then 

 i realised that the yellow disc was a straw hat    i took a deep breath      a tired voice answered    yes         as i heard it  i realised that i liked him  and that i would rather not know who was keeping him company    thats enough for now  isnt it    i think so    before he had hung up  i added hastily   listen  if you can  come and see me  in the operating room or in my cabin  will you    okay  but i dont know when  this was the end of the conference
