the light woke me up in the middle of the night  with one hand in my visor  i raised myself on my elbow  wrapped in a sheet  her hair in her face    huddled at the foot of the bed  her shoulders were shaking  she was crying silently         she shrank further into herself       whats wrong with you  i sat up  badly awake  still overwhelmed by the nightmare that had plagued me a moment earlier  she was still shaking  i put my arms out  she pushed me away and hid her face       my love      shut up          whats the matter  she showed her wet  quivering face  big tears  childish tears  ran down her cheeks  sparkled in the dimple above her chin  dripped onto the sheet    you dont want me    what are you making up    i heard  i felt my jaw muscles twitch    what did you hear  you didnt understand      i understood  i understood very well  you said it wasnt me  you want me to leave  i would leave  my god  i would leave  but i cant  i dont know why  ive tried to leave  i just cant  im such a  such a coward    come on  little one  i grabbed her  held her to me with all my strength  she was all i cared about  the rest fell away  i kissed her hands  her fingers wet with tears  i spoke to her  i begged her to listen to me  i asked for her indulgence  i repeated

 i told her that she had had a stupid dream  a horrible dream  she gradually calmed down  she stopped crying  her eyes were huge  the eyes of a sleepwalker  she turned her head away    no  she said  shut up  dont talk like that  you mustnt  youre not the same for me    i let out a groan    what    no  you dont want me  i understood that a long time ago  i pretended not to notice  i thought that maybe i was imagining things  but no    youre not the same  you dont take me seriously  a dream  yes  its true  but it was you who was dreaming  and you were dreaming of me  you said my name with revulsion  why did you say it  why    i knelt down and hugged her legs    my little one      i dont want you to talk to me like that  i dont want you to talk to me like that  you hear  im not your child  im not a child  im    she burst into tears and fell face down into the pillow  i got up  the fans hummed softly  i was cold  i threw the bathrobe over my shoulders and sat down next to    i touched his arm   listen     im going to tell you something  im going to tell you the truth  she sat up  using both hands  i could see the veins pulsing under the thin skin of her neck  again i felt the muscles in my jaw twitch  i was getting colder and colder  my head was completely empty    the truth   asked    word of honour  my throat tightened and i didnt answer immediately  word of honour   our sacred formula  our old oath formula  the oath thus sealed  neither of us dared to lie or say anything  i remembered the time when we used to torment each other  out of an excessive concern for sincerity  convinced that this naive quest for the truth preserved our union  i replied gravely 

   word of honour         she was waiting    you too     have changed  we all change  but thats not what i wanted to tell you  for some reason that neither of us know exactly  it seems that    you cant leave me  thats good for me  because i cant leave you either         i lifted her  still wrapped in her sheet  a tear soaked corner of the sheet brushed the back of my neck  i walked up and down and rocked    she stroked my cheeks    no  you havent changed  its me   she whispered in my ear  somethings not right  maybe its since the accident  she looked at the black  empty rectangle of the door  the night before  i had taken the debris to the warehouse  a new door would have to be hung  i settled   on the bed  leaning over her  i asked   do you ever sleep    i dont know    what do you mean you dont know    i have dreams    i dont know if theyre really dreams  maybe im ill  i lie there and think and    she shivered  i asked quietly   what    i have strange thoughts  i dont know where they come from  i asked again   for example  and i said to myself   whatever she says  keep calm  i prepared myself for her answer as one prepares for a blow  she shook her head in confusion   these are thoughts    around me      i dont understand    i dont understand  i have the impression that they are not only inside me  but further away  i cant explain  i cant find words   

 i cut off  almost in spite of myself    they must be dreams      then i caught my breath and continued  then i drew a breath and continued   now well turn out the light and  until the morning  no more sorrows  tomorrow morning  if you like  well make up new ones   well  she flicked the switch  and darkness separated us  i lay down on the bed  a warm breath was coming towards me  i hugged her  she whispered    harder    and after a long moment       what    i love you  i almost screamed 

the morning was red  the blistering disc of the sun was rising on the horizon  a letter was waiting for me on the threshold  i tore open the envelope  i could hear   humming in the bathroom  from time to time she would poke her head inside the room and show me her face covered with wet hair  i went to the window and read      its starting    has decided on an aggressive treatment  he believes he will succeed in destabilising the neutrino structures  he would like to examine a certain amount of f plasma subjected to peripheral transport  he suggests that you go on a reconnaissance trip and take a certain amount of plasma with you in the capsule  its up to you  but let me know what you decide  i dont have an opinion  i dont seem to have anything left  if i prefer you to accept  then at least we will have the impression of taking a step forward  otherwise  all thats left is to envy g 
your old rat 

 p s  dont go into the radio booth   thats all i ask  you can phone   my heart sank as i read this letter  i read it carefully once more  then tore it up and threw the pieces of paper into the sink  i chose a combination for    i repeated the gestures of the abominable comedy i had imagined the other day  but   knew nothing  when i told her that i was going to scout  and offered her to accompany me  she was very much looking forward to the trip  we stopped in the kitchen and together we prepared breakfast    ate very little  when the meal was over  i went to the library and   followed me  before carrying out  s desired mission  i wanted to take a look at the literature on magnetic fields and neutrino structures  without yet knowing how i was going to proceed  i had decided to exercise control over the work of the eminent physicist  of course  i thought  when the annihilator was perfected  i would not prevent   and   from  delivering themselves   i could take   with me  and we would wait for the operation to be completed somewhere outside the station   in the cabin of a flying vehicle  i struggled on the big computer  sometimes it responded to my operations by ejecting a card with the terse inscription  missing from the catalogue   sometimes it suggested drowning me in such a cataract of highly specialised physics books that i hesitated to take advantage of its advice  i didnt want to leave the vast circular room  though  i felt at home in my egg  between the rows of drawers crammed with microfilms and electrical recordings  located in the very centre of the station  the library had no windows  it was the best insulated place inside the steel shell  this  no doubt  was why i felt so good  despite the obvious failure of my research  wandering through the huge room  i found myself standing in front of a ceiling high shelf with about six hundred volumes on its shelves  all classics concerning the history of

 solaris  starting with the nine volumes of gieses monumental and already relatively outdated monograph  this was certainly not an ostentatious display  highly unlikely here  but a respectful tribute to the memory of the pioneers  i took out gieses heavy volumes and  sitting on the arm of a chair  began to leaf through them     too  had found some reading material  over her shoulder i read a few lines  she had chosen one of the many books taken by the first expedition  the interplanetary cook  a volume that may have belonged to giese personally    was carefully studying the culinary recipes adapted to the harsh conditions of cosmonautics  i said nothing and returned to the esteemed book i was holding in my lap  solaris   ten years of exploration had been published in the solariana series  volumes 4 to 13  while the numbering of the latest books published in the same series was four digits  giese lacked lyricism  but in the study of solaris  a lyrical viewpoint can only hinder the explorer  imagination and premature assumptions are particularly harmful when dealing with a planet where  in the end  anything is possible  it is very likely that the implausible descriptions of the plasma metamorphoses of the ocean accurately reflect the observed phenomena  although these descriptions are uncontrollable  as the ocean rarely repeats itself  the strange character  the gigantism of these phenomena fills the first time observer with dread  and he would consider similar phenomena as a mere  caprice of nature    an accidental manifestation of blind forces   if he were to observe them on a smaller scale  in some mire  in short  the genius and the mediocre mind remain equally perplexed by the inexhaustible diversity of solar formations   no man has really familiarised himself with the phenomena of the living ocean  giese was not a mediocre mind  not a genius either  he was a pedantic classifier  one of those whose untiring dedication to his work completely absorbs him and preserves him from the tumult of life  he

 he used relatively banal descriptive language  which he supplemented with terms of his own invention  which were inadequate and even misguided  but  lets face it  no terminology can express what happens on solaris  tree mountains  longus  fungus  mimoids  symmetriads and asymmetriads  vertebrates and agilus have a terribly artificial linguistic physiognomy  these bastard terms do  however  give an idea of solaris to anyone who has only ever seen blurry photographs and very imperfect films of the planet  in fact  despite his circumspection  our scrupulous classifier has more than once erred on the side of caution  man never ceases to make assumptions  even when he shies away from them and believes himself immune to temptation  giese considered the longus to be a category of fundamental forms  he compared them to gigantic wave accumulations and compared the formation of the longus to the flowing movements of our land oceans  it is enough to refer to the first edition of his work to see that he had first called them  flows   inspired by a geocentrism that could be considered amusing  if one did not notice that this geocentrism explicitly betrays the embarrassment of the scientist  as long as one seeks to establish comparisons with the earth  it must be specified that the  longus  are formations whose dimensions exceed those of the great canyon of colorado  that they occur in a material which on the surface has an appearance of foamy colloid  in the course of this fantastic  work  the foam freezes in festoons of lace with enormous meshes  some scholars speak of  ossified cankers    while at depth the substance becomes firmer and firmer  like a bandaged muscle  a muscle which  fifteen metres from the surface  is as hard as rock and yet retains its suppleness  the  longus  itself  an apparently independent creation  stretches for kilometres   between distended membranous walls to which the  ossified excrescences  cling   a colossal python  which would have devoured mountains and which silently digests  printing

 its crawling body with a slow  vibrating movement from time to time  the  longus  only looks like a passive reptile when you fly over it from a great height  when you get closer  and the two  ravine walls  dominate the flying apparatus by a few hundred metres  you will notice that this inflated cylinder  stretched to the horizon  is animated by a vertiginous movement  at first  one notices the continuous rotation of a sort of grey green sludge  which violently reflects the suns rays  but  if the apparatus descends further until it almost touches the  back of the python   the edges of the  ravine  sheltering the  longus  are then similar to the ridges bordering a geological subsidence   one notices that it is a much more complicated movement  made up of concentric swirls where darker currents intersect  at times  this mantle becomes a shiny crust  reflecting the sky and clouds  and immediately riddled by the detonating eruptions of internal gases and fluids  gradually  it became clear that this was the centre of the forces that were pushing apart and lifting the two slowly crystallising gelatinous sides towards the sky  but science did not accept such evidence without further proof  over the years  heated discussions have continued on a priority theme  what exactly is going on inside the longus  which criss cross the vastness of the living ocean in their millions  these longus were thought to have organic functions  they were said to be involved in the transformation of matter  some suggested that they were involved in respiratory processes  others suggested that they were involved in the transport of foodstuffs  the dust of the libraries has buried the infinite repertoire of suppositions  tedious and sometimes dangerous experiments eliminated all these hypotheses  today  we only talk about longus  relatively simple and stable formations  whose existence is measured in weeks   an exceptional feature among the phenomena observed on the planet  mimoids are significantly more complex  more fanciful formations that provoke a more vehement reaction from the observer   a reaction that is not always the case 

 instinctive reaction  it goes without saying  it is no exaggeration to say that giese fell in love with the  mimoids  and soon devoted all his time to their study  description and definition until the end of his life  by the name he gave to these phenomena  he wanted to express their most disturbing characteristic   the imitation of objects  close or distant  outside the ocean  one fine day  a large  flattened  crumbling  tar coated disc was seen buried beneath the surface of the ocean  after a few hours  the disc begins to decompose into leaves  which gradually rise  the observer then thinks he is witnessing a furious struggle  from all directions  powerful waves  like convulsed lips  fleshy jaws  rush in  opening greedily over the shredded and wavering sheet  then sinking into the depths  each time a wave crater collapses and engulfs  the fall of this mass of a hundred thousand tons is accompanied for a second by a viscous roar  a monstrous thunderclap  the bituminous sheet is pushed down  jostled  dismembered  with each new assault  circular films scatter and hover  undulating and languid wings  under the surface of the ocean  they transform into pear shaped clusters  long necklaces  merge with each other and rise again  carrying in their folds lumpy fragments of the base of the primitive disc  while around them the waves continue to crumble at the sides of a widening crater  the phenomenon may last a day  it may last a month  and sometimes it remains without consequences  the conscientious giese had called this first variant the  aborted mimoid   because he was convinced that each of these cataclysms was aimed at an ultimate end  the  major mimoid   a colony of polypiers  the whole of which exceeded the surface area of a city   pale outgrowths assigned to imitate the forms outside the ocean  uyvens  on the other hand  considered this last phase to be a degeneration  a necrosis  according to him  the appearance of  copies  corresponded to a loss of


 the appearance of the  copies  corresponded to a localized loss of the oceans own forces  which no longer controlled the original forms it had created  giese  however  persisted in seeing the various phases of the process as a continuous process towards perfection  he displayed a confidence that was all the more surprising  given that he was usually overly measured and cautious when he proposed   with the boldness of an ant advancing over a frozen waterfall   the slightest hypothesis concerning the other creations of the ocean  seen from above  the mimoid looks like a city  it is only an illusion  caused by our need to draw analogies with what we know  when the sky is clear  a mass of superheated air covers the flexible structures of the polypiers piled on top of each other and topped with membranous palisades with a vibrating envelope  the first cloud that crosses the azure  i said  azure   but here the sky is purple  or eerily white during the  blue  day   the first cloud that passes wakes the mimoid  all the outgrowths suddenly develop new buds  then the whole of the polypiers projects a large integument upwards  which expands  swells  swells  fades and  after a few minutes  imitates the scroll of a cloud  the enormous object casts a reddish shadow on the mimoid  the tops of which tilt towards each other  this movement always taking place in the opposite direction to that of the real cloud  if he had learned from his sacrifice why this was so  i suppose giese would have gladly had his hand cut off  but these  isolated  productions of the mimoid are nothing compared to the impetuous activity it displays when  stimulated  by objects of human origin  the reproduction process embraces all objects within a radius of eight to nine miles  most often the reproduction is an enlargement of the original  whose forms are sometimes copied very roughly  the reproduction of machines  in particular  gives rise to simplifications that could be considered grotesque  even caricatural  the copy of the object is always modelled in this colourless integument  which hovers over the protuberances  linked to the original 

 the copy of the object is always modelled in this colourless integument  which hovers above the protuberances  connected to its base only by tenuous umbilical cords  and which slides and crawls  which folds  stretches or inflates  and finally takes on the most complicated forms  a flying machine  a grid or a mast are reproduced at the same speed  however  humans do not stimulate the mimoid  more precisely  the mimoid does not react to any living matter and has never copied  for example  the plants that the researchers brought with them for experiments  on the other hand  the mimoid immediately reproduces a mannequin  a doll in human form  a statuette representing a dog or a tree sculpted from any material  here we must point out  parenthetically  that the  obedience  of the mimoid to the solarist experimenters is not a token of  goodwill    it is not constant  the most evolved mimoid has its lazy days  when it lives in slow motion  when its pulse weakens  this pulse is not discernible to the naked eye and has only been discovered with the help of film footage  with each ebb and flow of the pulse extending over two hours  during these lazy days  the mimoid can easily be explored  especially if it is old  as both the base anchored in the ocean and the protrusions of this base have a relative firmness  which allows humans to land safely on the mimoid  in fact  one can also stay inside the mimoid during its  active days   but then visibility is almost nil  due to a whitish colloidal dust  which spreads continuously through the tears of the integument suspended above the protuberances  from close up  it is impossible to distinguish the shapes reproduced by this integument  because of their gigantic size   the dimensions of the smallest copy are those of a mountain  moreover  a thick layer of colloidal snow quickly covers the base of the mimoid  this muddy carpet only hardens after a few hours  the  frozen  crust can support the weight of a man  although it is made of a much lighter material than pumice   ultimately  without appropriate equipment  there is a risk of

 in the end  without the proper equipment  one risks getting lost in the labyrinth of gnarled and cracked structures  which sometimes look like curled up colonnades  sometimes like frozen geysers  there is a risk of getting lost even in daylight  as the suns rays do not penetrate the white ceiling projected into the atmosphere by the  imitative explosions   on good days  good days for the scientist as well as for the mimic   the observer contemplates an unforgettable spectacle  on these days of hyperproduction  the mimoid indulges in extraordinary creative outbursts  he indulges in variations on the theme of external objects  which he likes to complicate and from which he develops  formal extensions   he thus amuses himself for hours  to the joy of the non figurative painter and the despair of the scholar  who tries in vain to understand anything about the processes underway  if  at times  the mimoid has childish simplifications  it also has its baroque deviations  its magnificent fits of extravagance  the old mimoids  in particular  make very comical shapes  when i looked at the photographs  however  i was never inclined to laugh  so overwhelmed was i  each time  by their mystery  during the first years of exploration  people literally threw themselves on the mimoids   windows opened in the ocean  it was said  which would facilitate the ardently hoped for contact between two civilisations  soon enough  it had to be admitted that the famous contact had not been announced in any way  that everything was limited to a reproduction of forms  and that we were treading on a path leading nowhere  many scholars  yielding to the temptation of a latent anthropomorphism or zoomorphism  saw in various other formations of the living ocean  sensory organs  or even  limbs    this is how scholars  including maartens and ekkonai  defined gieses  vertebrates  and  agilus  for a time  if one ventures to declare that these oceanic protuberances  which soar up to two miles into the atmosphere  are limbs  one might as well


 earthquakes are the gymnastics of the earths crust  three hundred chapters make up the repertoire of formations that regularly occur on the surface of the living ocean  and which can be observed by the dozens  even hundreds  in twenty four hours  symmetriads   according to the terminology and definition of the giese school   are the least human formations  i e  they bear no resemblance to anything that man can see on earth  at the time when the study of symmetriads was undertaken  it was already known that the ocean was not aggressive and that its plasma eddies would not engulf anyone except a remarkably careless and thoughtless individual  i am not  of course  talking about accidents resulting from a failure of the oxygenation system  for example  or of the air conditioners   it is indeed possible to fly through the cylindrical body of the longus or the fantastic column of vertebrates oscillating among the clouds without the slightest danger  for the plasma moves away at the speed of sound in the solar atmosphere  and clears a passage for the foreign body  deep tunnels even open up under the surface of the ocean  the instantaneous energy deployed for this purpose is prodigious   skriabin estimated it at approximately 1019 ergs   however  the exploration of the symmetries was begun with increased caution  avoiding any reckless incursion and multiplying precautions   precautions that were often illusory  every child on earth knows the names of the first men who ventured into the abyss of a symmetriad  the danger of these giant formations does not lie in their appearance  although this can inspire nightmares  rather  the danger lies in the fact that inside a symmetriad there is nothing that is stable or secure in any way   even the laws of physics are abolished  it is worth noting that the explorers of the symmetriads were more ardent than other scientists in supporting the thesis that the living ocean was endowed with intelligence 


 symmetriads suddenly appear  the birth of a symmetriad is similar to an eruption  an hour before the eruption  the ocean begins to glow  glazed over an area of a few dozen square kilometres  however  it remains fluid and the rhythm of the waves does not change  sometimes  but not necessarily  this vitrification phenomenon occurs around the funnel left by an agilus  after an hour  the shiny envelope of the ocean flies away and forms a monstrous bubble  which reflects the firmament  the sun  the clouds and the whole horizon  a spray of changing and diaphanous images  the light rays  broken and deflected  create a dazzling play of colours  the light effects on a symmetrical picture are particularly striking during the blue day and at sunset  it is as if the planet is giving birth to a double  which increases in size from moment to moment  and suddenly the huge flaming globe  having just spread out over the ocean  bursts at the top and splits vertically  but this is not a disintegration  this second phase  rather inappropriately called the floral calyx phase  lasts a few seconds  the membranous arches pointing towards the sky fold inwards and merge into a squat torso  within which a multitude of phenomena continue  at the centre of this torso   explored for the first time by the seventy members of the hamalei expedition   a gigantic process of polycrystallisation erects an axis  commonly called the spine  a term of which i am not a fan  the vertiginous architectonics of this central pillar is supported in statu nascendi by vertical shafts  of an almost liquid gelatinous consistency  which continually spring from disproportionate crevices  during this process  the colossus   surrounded by a belt of snowy foam  the large bubbles of which are violently agitated   emits a continuous and dull roar  from the centre to the periphery  the complicated revolutions of heavy fins take place  on top of which are thickening trails of ductile material rising from the depths  simultaneously  the gelatinous geysers turn into columns

 these bundles of antennae  directed towards points of the structure rigorously determined by the overall dynamics  are reminiscent of the gills of an embryo and swirl at a fabulous speed  flooded with streams of pink blood and a dark green  almost black secretion  from this moment on  the symmetriad begins to reveal its most extraordinary feature   the ability to shape or even negate certain physical laws  first of all  let us say that no two symmetriads are identical and that the geometry of each one is always a new  invention  of the living ocean  the interior of the symmetriad becomes a factory producing  monumental machines   as these creations are often called  although they are not at all reminiscent of man made machines  this is an activity with limited ends and is therefore in a way  mechanical   when the geysers gushing out of the abyss have congealed into columns or galleries and corridors running off in all directions  when the  membranes  have fixed themselves into an inextricable arrangement of landings  panels and vaults  the symmetriad justifies its name  for the whole structure is divided into two equal parts  each composed in an absolutely similar manner  after twenty to thirty minutes   sometimes with the axis tilted at an angle of eight to twelve degrees   the giant begins to descend slowly   there are larger and smaller symmetries  but even the smallest  when the base is already submerged  still reach a height of some eight hundred metres and are visible from several miles away   then the massive body gradually stabilises   the inclined axis returns to the vertical   and the partially submerged symmetriad finally comes to rest  it is then possible to explore it without danger  by entering  near the top  through one of the many siphons that pierce the cap  orifices of various conduits and channels  the symmetriad presents   in its entirety   the three dimensional development of some transcendental equation 


 it is well known that any equation can be expressed in the figurative language of higher geometry and its spatial representation constructed  the symmetriad  thus envisaged  is a relative of lobachevskys cones and riemanns negative curves  but an extremely distant relative  because of its unimaginable complexity  it offers  in the form of a volume of some thousand cubes  an expansion of the whole mathematical system and  in fact  a four dimensional expansion  because the fundamental terms of the equations are also expressed in time  in the changes that time brings about  it would be very natural  of course  to suppose that the symmetriad is a  mathematical machine  of the living ocean  a spatial representation   on the scale of the ocean   of the calculations it performs for purposes unknown to us  but no one today admits this idea of fermont  the hypothesis  of course  was tempting  however  it proved impossible to maintain the concept of the ocean examining the problems of matter  the cosmos and existence  with titanic eruptions  whose substance would participate by each fragment in the infinitely complex expression of a higher analysis  indeed  multiple phenomena contradict this too simple conception  of a childish naivety  according to some   there has been no shortage of attempts to transpose the symmetriad  to illustrate it  awerians demonstration was a great success  let us imagine  he said  an edifice dating from the splendour of babylon  but built in a living substance  sensitive and capable of evolving  the architectonics of this edifice goes through a series of phases and takes before our eyes the forms of a greek construction  then a roman one  the columns  like vegetal stems  then become thinner  the vault lightens  rises  curves  the arch describes an abrupt parabola and breaks into a boom  gothic is born  it reaches its maturity  time flies and new forms take shape  the austerity of the line disappears under the explosions of an orgiastic exuberance  the baroque blooms without restraint  if the progression continues  always being understood that we

 if the progression continues  always on the understanding that we regard the successive mutations as stages in an evolutionary life  we finally arrive at the architecture of the cosmic epoch  and we may come to understand what a symmetriad is  however  whatever the developments and improvements made to the demonstration  attempts have been made to visualise it with models and films   the comparison remains weak  in fact  it is only a loophole  if not a deception  since the symmetriad resembles nothing we have ever seen on earth    man can only grasp a few things at a time  we can only see what is happening in front of us  here and now  we cannot simultaneously represent a succession of processes  however interrelated and complementary they may be to each other  our faculties of perception are thus limited even with regard to relatively simple phenomena  the destiny of a single man may be rich in meaning  we have only a vague idea of the destiny of a few hundred men  but the history of thousands  of millions of men  means  strictly speaking  nothing at all  the symmetry is a million  no  a billion  raised to the power of x   that is the incomprehensible  what would we understand about these innumerable naves   each with a capacity of ten kronecker units   that we explore  like ants  clinging to the folds of the vaults  breathing and contemplating the flight of gigantic spans  grey opalescences in the light of our projectors  flexible domes that interpenetrate and balance each other unerringly  perfection of a moment   for everything here passes and flows  movement is the essence of this architecture  concentrated and goal oriented movement  we observe only a fragment of the process  the vibration of a single string in a symphony orchestra of supergiants  while we know   we know without conceiving   that above us and below us  in dizzying abysses  beyond the limits of perception of the eyes and imagination  thousands and millions of transformations are taking place simultaneously  linked together like a score by a

 mathematical counterpoint  someone spoke of a geometric symphony   we remain deaf to this concert  to really see something  one would have to step back  take a considerable distance  but everything happens inside the symmetriad   a colossal and proliferating matrix  where creation is incessant  where the created immediately becomes the creator  where perfectly identical  twins  are born on opposite sides  separated by babelian scaffolding and miles of distance  here  each monumental construction  with a beauty whose accomplishment escapes our sight  is the performer and the leader  the forms collaborate with each other and influence each other in turn  a symphony   yes  a symphony that creates itself and stops itself  the end of the symphony is horrible  all the witnesses have the feeling that they are witnessing a tragedy   a crime  after two or three hours   the process of spontaneous reproduction  of explosive proliferation  never lasts longer   the living ocean goes on the attack  the smooth surface of the ocean becomes animated and wrinkled  the parched foam becomes fluid again and begins to bubble  from all horizons come waves in concentric rows  fleshy jaws  incomparably larger than the fat lips that surround the mimoid at its birth  the submerged part of the symmetriad is compressed  the colossus rises  as if it were going to be thrown out of the planets zone of attraction  the upper layers of the ocean redouble their activity  the waves rush higher and higher  lick the sides of the symmetriad  envelop it  stiffen up  clog the orifices  and all of this is nothing  compared to what happens inside the symmetriad first  the creative process   the evolutionary architectonics   freezes for a brief moment  and then there is a  panic   the supple movement of interpenetration of forms  the harmonious interplay of planes and lines  is rushed  one gets the overwhelming impression that the colossus  faced with the threatening danger  is trying to hasten some achievement  the more the movement of the transformations accelerates  the greater the horror inspired by the metamorphosis of the symmetriad and its dynamics  the flight

 the admirable flight of the domes softens  the vaults sag and hang   false notes  appear  unfinished  grotesque   crippled  forms  from the invisible depths  a powerful roar escapes  a roar   a breath of air  a sigh of agony  rushes through the narrowed channels  snores and thunders  and the collapsed domes grumble like so many monstrous throats  bristling with stalactites of mucus  inert vocal cords  so the spectator  despite the movement that is unleashed with increased violence   a movement of obvious destruction   is seized by an invincible numbness  only the hurricane rising from the abyss and inflating the thousands of galleries still lifts the high structure  soon it falls back and begins to melt  there are final palpitations  convulsions  blind and disordered jolts  attacked  eaten away  scoured  the giant slowly sinks and disappears  covered by swirls of foam  and what does all this mean  yes  what does it mean  i remembered an incident from my days as  s assistant  a group of schoolchildren were visiting the solarist institute in aden  the teenagers had walked through a side cabinet into the main library room and were staring at the microfilm boxes on the left side of the entrance  which took up one half of the large room  there  it was explained to them  among other phenomena immortalized by the image  were minute fragments of long lost symmetriads   not single shots  but whole reels  and there were more than ninety thousand of them  a plump little girl  about fifteen years old  with a nose like a pair of glasses  a lively and determined look in her eyes  suddenly asked    and whats the point of this  in the awkward silence that followed  the teacher merely gave her unruly pupil a stern look  among the solarists responsible for guiding the pupils  i was one of these guides   no one could answer  for no two symmetries are alike  and the phenomena that take place within a symmetriad are  in general  unpredictable  sometimes 

 no sound is produced  sometimes the refractive index increases or decreases  sometimes  rhythmic pulses cause a local change in gravitation  as if the symmetriad had a heart that beat as it gravitated  sometimes the observers compasses start to spin in circles  ionised layers appear and disappear    we could go on and on  besides  if we ever manage to unlock the secret of symmetriads  we will still have asymmetriads  asymmetriads are born in the same way as symmetriads  but their end is different  and in an asymmetriad one can hardly distinguish anything but quivering  vibrating and glittering  we know  however  that within an asymmetry  dizzying processes take place at a speed that defies the laws of physics  and these are called giant quantum phenomena  the mathematical analogy of such phenomena with certain three dimensional models of the atom is so unstable and elusive that some observers consider the similarity to be of secondary interest  if not purely accidental  asymmetries have a very brief existence   fifteen to twenty minutes   and the end of an asymmetriad is even more horrible than the end of a symmetriad  with the tempestuous  howling blast that invades the asymmetriad  a fluid protrudes  gurgles hideously and submerges everything in a boil of dirty foam  then an explosion  accompanied by a muddy eruption  throws up a column of debris  which falls back at length in a cloudy rain on the agitated ocean  within a radius of several tens of kilometres around the explosion site  such debris can be found  carried by the wind  dried out  yellow  flattened and similar to cartilaginous fragments  much rarer  difficult to observe and of very variable duration  some creations are completely detached from the ocean  the first remains of these freelancers were identified   wrongly  it was later shown   as the remains of creatures living in the depths of the ocean  the self contained forms are generally reminiscent of multi winged birds  fleeing from the shifting trunks of the agilus  but the

 notions imported from earth do not help to penetrate the mysteries of this planet  sometimes  as an exceptional apparition on the rocky shore of an island  one distinguishes strange seal like bodies  which wallow in the sun or lazily drag themselves towards the ocean  into which they are integrated  we were not leaving the man made notions of earth  as for a first contact    explorers travelled hundreds of kilometres into the depths of the symmetries  set up recording devices and automatic cameras  artificial satellites televised the budding of mimoids and longus  faithfully reporting images of maturation and annihilation  libraries were overflowing  archives were growing  and the price to pay for all this documentation was often very expensive  cataclysms engulfed a total of seven hundred and eighteen men who had not left the doomed colossi in time  in one infamous disaster  one hundred and six people died  including giese himself  who was seventy years old at the time  the expedition was investigating a clearly defined symmetriad  which was suddenly destroyed in a process of extermination peculiar to asymmetriads  in two seconds  an eruption of sticky muck engulfed seventy nine men  their machines and their aircraft  twenty seven other observers  flying over the area in planes and helicopters  were also swept into the abyss  the site of the disaster  at the intersection of the 42nd parallel and the 89th meridian  is now known as the hundred and sixth eruption  however  the memory of this cataclysm  of which no trace remains in the ocean  can only be found on maps  in the aftermath of the hundred and sixth eruption  for the first time in the history of solar studies  there were petitions demanding a thermonuclear attack on the ocean  this retaliation would have been more cruel than revenge  since it was to destroy what we did not understand  although it was never officially acknowledged  it is likely that tsankens ultimatum influenced the negative outcome of the vote  tsanken

 commanded gieses reserve team   a transmission error had spared his life  he had wandered over the ocean and arrived near the scene of the disaster a few minutes after the explosion  from which he could still see the black mushroom  when he learned of the planned nuclear attack  he threatened to blow up the station with the nineteen survivors who had taken refuge there  today  there are only three of us left in the station    controlled by satellites  the construction of the station was a technical operation of which men could be proud  but the ocean  in a few seconds  raises infinitely more considerable structures  the station is a disc with a radius of one hundred metres  it has four floors in the centre and two floors around the perimeter  it is held between five hundred and one thousand five hundred metres above the ocean by gravitational pulls to compensate for the forces of attraction  in addition to all the devices available to the ordinary stations and the large satelloids of other planets  the solaris station is equipped with special radars  sensitive to the first change in the ocean surface  which trigger a back up energy allowing the steel disc to rise into the stratosphere as soon as there are the first signs of a new plasma construction  yes  today  despite the presence of our faithful visitors  the station was singularly depopulated  since the robots had been locked up on the lower floor  in the warehouses   for some reason i didnt know yet   we walked around without meeting anyone  along the corridors of a ghost ship  abandoned by its crew and whose machines were still running  when i placed the ninth volume of gieses monograph on its shelf  it seemed to me that the steel floor  covered with plastic foam  had vibrated under my feet  i stood still  but the vibration did not repeat itself  since the library was perfectly isolated from the other rooms  this vibration could only have one origin  a rocket had just left the station  this thought brought me back to reality  i had not yet decided to go out  as   wanted  at

 pretending to fully approve of his plan  i was at most postponing the start of hostilities  since i was determined to save    but did   have any chance of success  in any case  he had enormous advantages over me   he was a physicist  he knew the problem much better than i did  i could only rely  paradoxically  on the superiority of the ocean  for an hour i toiled over the microfilm study  trying to penetrate the physics of neutrinos through a mathematical language in which i recognised no familiar landmarks  at first  the undertaking seemed hopeless  there were no less than five theories of neutrino fields  a clear sign that none of them was decisive  yet  finally  i managed to clear a rather promising piece of ground  i was copying formulas when i heard a knock  i got up quickly and went to open the door    looked up at me with his face glistening with sweat  behind him the corridor was deserted    ah  its you      i pushed the panel aside    i pushed aside the panel  come in    yes  its me  he spoke in a hoarse voice  pockets hung under his bloodshot eyes  he wore a shiny rubber radiation apron  and elastic braces supported the eternally filthy trousers  his gaze swept across the evenly lit circular room and settled on    she was standing at the back next to an armchair    looked back at me  i lowered my eyelids imperceptibly  he bowed  and i said in a casual tone     this is dr          this is my wife    his hesitation was dangerously prolonged  but he managed to finish   that is why i did not have the pleasure of meeting you earlier    smiled and held out his hand  which he shook with some amazement  he blinked several times and stood looking at it without saying anything 

 i took him by the shoulder    excuse me   he said to    i wanted to talk to you       with superb ease i replied   of course  i am at your disposal    i was playing a sinister game  but what else could i do       my dear  dont bother  i took   by the elbow and led him to the seats on the other side of the room    sat in the chair i had occupied earlier  she had turned it so that she could see us over her book  i asked quietly   whats up  he whispered through his teeth    i got a divorce    if  a few days before  i had been told of such a conversation  i would have laughed  but in the station my sense of humour was dulled    since last night i have lived hours that count for years   he added  years you dont forget  what about you  after a moment  i answered    nothing    i didnt know what to say  i liked him  but i was suspicious of him  or rather of the reason for his visit  he repeated   nothing  i pretended not to understand    what  with half closed eyes he leaned so close to me that i felt the warmth of his breath on my face  i cant reach   anymore  i only know what i wrote to you  what he told me after our little conference      did he disconnect his phone    no  there was a short circuit in his house  he clenched his fist and made the gesture of smashing an object  an unpleasant smile


 he clenched his fist and made a gesture of smashing an object  an unpleasant smile tugged at the corner of his lips  i looked at him wordlessly       i came to    what do you intend to do  i answered slowly    are you here to get my answer to your letter  ill go for a walk  i have no reason to refuse  i was just preparing my trip    he interrupted me    no  its not that  i feigned surprise   no  then what is it  im listening  he mumbled        thinks hes on the way       didnt take his eyes off me  i didnt move  i tried to keep an air of indifference    first there was that x ray operation  which he organised with    you remember  it may have caused some modification      what modification    they sent a beam of radiation directly into the ocean  only modulating the intensity according to a program    i know  niline had already done it  and many others    yes  but the others had administered a weak radiation  this time it was a strong radiation  they sent all the energy they could muster into the ocean    that could have unpleasant consequences    violation of the four party agreement and the un         you know that doesnt matter now    is dead    ah  is   going to pin it on him    i dont know  i dont know  we havent talked about it  it doesnt matter    is struck by the fact that the  visitors  always arrive when you wake up  he deduces that the ocean is mainly interested in our sleep and gets its production revenue from us while we are sleeping  now   would like to send him our waking state   our waking thoughts   you understand    by post 

   keep your jokes to yourself  a beam of rays will be modulated by the brain currents of one of us  i was beginning to see clearly    ah  and one of us is me    yes    thought of you    you can thank him for me    what did you say  i was silent    glanced at    who was reading absorbedly  then back at me  i felt myself turning pale    so   he repeated  i shrugged my shoulders   the idea of transmitting these sermons on the greatness of man by x ray seems to me absolutely ridiculous  and to you too  doesnt it    yes   he said    very well   he said  smiling as if i had agreed to his wish   so youre against this   project  i didnt know how it happened  but i could tell from his expression that he had led me by the nose    very well   he continued  theres a second project  building a roche device    an annihilator    yes    has already begun the preliminary calculations  it is serious  and it doesnt even require a great expenditure of energy  the device will produce magnetic anti fields twenty four hours a day  for an indefinite time    how do you picture this    it is very simple  these are neutrino anti fields  ordinary matter will remain unchanged  only the    neutrino structures will be annihilated  do you understand  satisfied  he smiled  i stood still  my mouth half open  he stopped smiling  his forehead wrinkled  he considered me carefully and waited a moment before speaking 


   well  were abandoning the first project  the  thought  project  as for the second project    is actively working on it  lets call it liberation  i closed my eyes for a moment  suddenly i made up my mind    was not a physicist    had disconnected or destroyed his phone  perfect  then i replied   id call this second project operation slaughterhouse    youve already practised as a killer  dont tell me you havent  this time its something completely different  no more visitors  no more f creations   nothing  disintegration follows instantly after materialisation  i nodded  with a smile that i hoped to make as natural as possible    there is a misunderstanding  i am not talking to you about moral scruples  but about self preservation  my dear    i dont want to die    what  he looked at me suspiciously  i pulled a sheet of paper from my pocket  covered with formulas    i too have considered this experiment  it was me who put forward the neutrino hypothesis  wasnt it  look at this  we can create anti fields  indeed  it is harmless to ordinary matter  but at the moment of destabilisation  when the neutrino structure decays  we release the energy that holds the structure together   a considerable surplus of energy is released  if we assume 108 ergs for one kilogram of substance at rest  we will get 57 multiplied by 108 for a creation f  do you know what that means     the equivalent of a small charge of uranium exploding inside the station    what are you talking about  but      must have considered all this    i smiled wickedly    not necessarily  you see    belongs to the school of frazer and cajolla  according to their theories  at the moment of disintegration  all the latent energy is released in the form of a

 radiation   a powerful light  perhaps not harmless  but not destructive  however  there are other hypotheses  other theories about neutrino fields  according to cayatte  according to awalow  according to sion  the range of the emission is considerably wider  at its maximum  the release of energy becomes a powerful gamma ray emission    trusts his masters and their theories  thats very nice  but there are other masters and other theories  and do you know      i continued  seeing that my words had impressed him   we must also take into account this ocean  to make his creations  he must have followed an optimal method  in other words  the processes of the ocean seem to me to be an argument in favour of the other school  and against      give me that paper       i gave him the sheet  i gave him the paper and he bowed his head and tried to decipher my scribbles  with the tip of his finger he underlined something    whats that  i took the paper back    this  the magnetic field transmutation tensor    give me      why  i knew what he was going to say    i have to show these calculations to      as you wish      i had taken an indifferent tone    i can give you this sheet  of course  only  you see  no one has yet verified these theories by experiment  we didnt know about such structures yet  he trusts frazer  and i followed zions theory    will tell you that i am not a physicist  that sion is not either  or at least not from his point of view  he will argue  i dont want a discussion  which would lead me to recant  for the greater glory of    i can convince you  i am not strong enough to convince   and i wont try    so what do you want to do  he set to work   

   spoke in a timeless voice  he had stooped  all his animation had subsided  i didnt know if he trusted me  but i didnt really care  i answered quietly   what do i want to do  what a man who is being tried to kill does    i will try to communicate with him  he may have planned precautions       grunted  then straightened his head   listen  what if    what about the first project  would you accept    would agree  im sure he would  its    at least  its a chance to take    do you believe it    no   he answered immediately  but what are we risking  i didnt want to accept too quickly  i wanted to gain time and   could help me extend the deadline    ill think about it    well  im off     grunted    when he stood up  every bone in his body cracked    well have to start with an encephalogram   he said  rubbing his apron as if he were trying to erase an invisible stain    good  without taking leave of    he walked to the door  with the book in his lap    watched him leave  when the door closed  i stood up  i smoothed out the sheet of paper in my hand  the formulas were correct  i had not falsified them  but would zion have approved of my developments  probably not  i shuddered    had come up and touched my shoulder         what  dear    who was that    doctor    i told you    what kind of man    i dont know him well    why    he looked at me in such a strange way    he liked you 

 she shook her head    no  he looked at me in a different way    as if    she shivered  looked up at me and then looked down    lets get out of here
