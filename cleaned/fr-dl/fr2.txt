the corridor was empty  i stood still for a moment behind the closed door  the moan of the wind enveloped the watertight casing of the hose  on the door panel i saw  stuck askew  carelessly  a square of plaster  covered with a pencil inscription   man  i looked at the word  indistinctly scribbled  and wanted to go back to    i changed my mind  his demented warnings were still ringing in my ears  i moved forward into the passage  my shoulders bent under the weight of the suit  with muffled steps  more or less consciously fleeing from some invisible observer  i returned to the rotunda  coming out of the corridor  i found two doors on my left and two doors on my right  i read the names of the occupants  dr    dr    dr    there was no nameplate attached to the fourth door  i hesitated  gently pressed the handle and slowly opened the door  as i pushed the panel open  i had a hunch  almost a certainty  that someone was in the room  i entered  there was no one there  a concave picture window  only slightly smaller than the one in the cabin where i had discovered    overlooked the ocean  which glowed here   in the sun   with a greasy sheen  the waves seeming to secrete a reddish oil  scarlet reflections filled the whole room  whose layout was reminiscent of a ships cabin  on one side  surrounded by book laden shelves  a mechanical bed had been straightened against the wall  on the other side  between the many cupboards  hung nickel frames   series of aerial views  glued end to end with adhesive strips   and racks of test tubes and retorts  plugged with cotton pads  in front of the window  two rows of white enamel boxes blocked the way  i lifted a few boxes 

 i lifted a few lids  the boxes were crammed with instruments of all kinds  interspersed with plastic pipes  in each corner there was a tap  a refrigeration unit  an anti fogging device  a microscope had been placed on the floor because there was no room on the large table beside the window  turning round  i saw a tall cupboard by the front door  ajar  containing overalls  gowns  insulating aprons  linen  planetary exploration boots  polished aluminium cylinders   oxygen tanks for portable apparatus  two of these devices  with their masks  hung from the handle of the vertical bed  everywhere was the same chaos  a mess that had been hastily and crudely attempted to be hidden  i sniffed the air  i smelled a faint odour of chemical reagents and traces of a more pungent smell   chlorine  instinctively  i looked for the air vents under the floor  attached to the bars  paper ribbons floated gently  the blowers were working  providing normal air circulation  i took two chairs loaded with books  equipment and tools and placed them at the other end of the room  stacking them as best i could to leave a relatively clear space around the bed between the wardrobe and the bookcases  i pulled out a bracket to hang my suit on  i grabbed the end of the zip and loosened my fingers  held back by the confused idea that i was stripping myself of a shield  i could not bring myself to abandon my suit  once again i looked around the room  checked that the door was securely closed  that it had no lock  and after a brief hesitation i dragged some of the heavier boxes towards the threshold  having thus temporarily barricaded myself  in three shakes i freed myself from my rattling carapace  a narrow mirror  set in a cupboard door  reflected part of the room  from the corner of my eye i caught a moving form  i gasped  but it was only my own reflection  the knitted fabric under the suit was soaked with sweat  i pulled it out and pushed a sliding cabinet  it slid down the wall  revealing the shiny walls of a small bathroom  a flat box and a

 a flat  elongated box lay in the shower basin  i carried the tray into the room without difficulty  when i put it back on the floor  a spring blew the lid off and i saw compartments filled with strange objects  dark metal blanks  grotesque replicas of the instruments in the cupboards  none of the instruments in the box were usable  they were dull  atrophied  melted  as if from an inferno  strangely enough  even the ceramic handles  which were practically non fusible  had been deformed  no laboratory oven  heated to maximum temperature  could have melted them   perhaps an atomic pile  from the pocket of my suit i pulled out a radiation counter  but the little black beak remained silent as i approached the debris  all i had left on my body were a pair of pants and a net shirt  i quickly removed them  threw them away  and ran into the shower  the shock of the water felt good  twirling under the hard  hot spray  i rubbed myself with excessive vigour  splashing the walls  expelling  squeezing out of my skin all the filth of cloudy apprehension that had permeated me since my arrival  i searched the cupboard and found a training suit  which could also be worn under the suit  as i shoved all my meagre possessions into a pocket  i felt a hard object stuck among the pages of the notebook  it was a key  the key to my flat back on earth  i turned the key between my fingers in uncertainty  finally  i put it on the table  suddenly it occurred to me that i would need a weapon  a pocketknife was certainly not what i needed  but i didnt have anything else and i wasnt going to start looking for a radioactive gun or anything like that  i sat down on a tubular stool in the middle of the empty space  i wanted to be alone  i was pleased to see that i had more than half an hour  by nature i was scrupulous about keeping my commitments  whether important or insignificant  the hands of the clock   with twenty four signs dividing the dial   indicated seven hours  the sun   18  

 was falling  seven hours here was twenty hours on board the prometheus  solaris  on moddards screens  was nothing but an indistinct dust  confused with the stars  well  what did the prometheus matter to me  i closed my eyes  all i could hear was the whine of the pipes and the faint splash of water in the bathroom    was dead  not long ago  i understood  what had they done with his body  had they buried him  no  on this planet that was impossible  i pondered the question for a long time  preoccupied exclusively with the fate of the corpse  then i realised the absurdity of my thoughts  i got up and started walking up and down  with the tip of my foot i struck a bag which was emerging from a heap of books  i bent down and picked it up  i bent down and picked it up  it contained a dark glass vial  a vial so light that it seemed to have been blown into paper  i examined it in front of the window  in the crimson glow of a gloomy twilight  full of sooty mists  what was happening to me  why should i allow myself to be distracted by ramblings  or by the first trinket that came to hand  i shuddered  the lights had come on  controlled by a photocell  the sun had just set  what was going to happen  i was so tense that the feeling of an empty space in my back became unbearable  i decided to fight against myself  i pulled up a chair from the bookcase and chose a volume that had long been familiar to me  the second volume of hughes and eugels old monograph  historia solaris  i rested the large  tightly bound book in my lap and began to leaf through it  solaris was discovered about a hundred years before i was born  the planet orbits two suns   a red sun and a blue sun  no ship had come close to the planet in the forty years since its discovery  at that time  the gamow shapley theory that life was impossible on planets that are satellites of two solar bodies was taken as a certainty  the orbit is constantly

  19  

 the orbit is constantly modified by the varying play of gravitation  during the revolution around the two suns  the orbit  because of the variations of gravitation  flattens or distends and the elements of life  if they appear  are infallibly destroyed  either by intense heat radiation or by an extreme drop in temperature  these changes take place in a time estimated in millions of years  which is a very short time   according to the laws of astronomy or biology  evolution requires hundreds of millions  if not a billion years   according to the first calculations  solaris was to approach its red sun by half an astronomical unit in five hundred thousand years  and a million years later to crash into the glowing star  but after a few decades  it was discovered that the orbit did not show any of the expected changes  it was stable  as stable as the orbit of the planets in our solar system  observations and calculations were repeated with extreme precision  and they simply confirmed the initial conclusions  the orbit of solaris was unstable  a modest unit among the hundreds of planets discovered each year  to which the major statistics were limited to a few lines defining the particularities of its movement  solaris gradually rose to the rank of a celestial body worthy of more considerable attention  four years after this promotion  ottenskjolds expedition  flying over the planet with the laakon and two auxiliary ships  set out to study solaris  this expedition was only a preparatory  even improvised reconnaissance  as the scientists were not equipped to land  ottenskjold placed a large number of automatic observatory satellites in equatorial and polar orbits  whose main function was to measure gravitational potentials  in addition  the surface of the planet was studied  which is covered by an ocean dotted with countless islands with a high plateau configuration    the total area of these islands is smaller than the area of europe  although the diameter of the islands is   20   10 mm 

 solaris is one fifth the size of the earth  these irregularly distributed stretches of rocky  desolate territory are mainly clustered in the southern hemisphere    the composition of the oxygen free atmosphere was also analysed  and very precise measurements of the planets density  albedo and other astronomical characteristics were made  predictably  no life was found  either on the islands or in the ocean  over the next ten years  solaris became the centre of attraction for all the observatories studying this region of space  the planet  however  showed an astonishing tendency to maintain a gravitational orbit that should have been unstable beyond any doubt  the matter almost became a scandal  the results of the observations could only be inaccurate  and attempts were made to blame  for the sake of science  certain scientists  or the computers they used  the lack of funds delayed the departure of a real solarist expedition for three years  finally  shannahan  having completed his team  obtained from the institute three c tonnage units  the largest cosmic vessels of the time  a year and a half before the arrival of the expedition  which set out from aquarian alpha  a second exploration fleet  acting on behalf of the institute  had placed an automatic satelloid  luna 247  into solarist orbit    this satelloid  after three successive reconstructions  carried out a few decades apart  is still functioning today    the data provided by the satelloid definitively confirmed the observations of the ottenskjold expedition concerning the active nature of the oceans movements  one of shannahans ships remained in high orbit  the other two  after preliminary tests  landed on a rocky territory of about six hundred square miles in the southern hemisphere of solaris  the work of the expedition lasted eighteen months and was carried out under favourable conditions  except for an unfortunate accident caused by the malfunctioning of the apparatus  however  the team of scientists was divided into two camps   21

 the team of scientists  however  was divided into two opposing camps  with the ocean being the object of the quarrel  on the basis of the analyses  it was accepted that the ocean was an organic formation  at that time  no one had yet dared to declare it alive   but while biologists considered it to be a primitive formation   a sort of gigantic whole  a single  monstrous fluid cell  which they called a  prebiological formation    which surrounded the globe with a colloidal envelope a few miles thick in places   astronomers and physicists claimed that it must be an extraordinarily evolved organised structure  in their view  the ocean may even have exceeded the complexity of terrestrial organic structures  as it was able to effectively influence the course of the planets orbit  indeed  no other cause had been discovered that could explain solaris behaviour  and planetophysicists had established a relationship between certain processes in the plasma ocean and the locally measured gravitational potential  which changed in accordance with the oceans matter transformations  so it was physicists  not biologists  who came up with the paradoxical formulation plasma machine  meaning a formation that may be lifeless  according to our understanding  but capable of undertaking useful activities   on an astronomical scale  we should hasten to add  on the occasion of this quarrel   the upheavals of which  within a few weeks  reached the most eminent authorities   the gamow shapley doctrine  unquestioned for eighty years  was shaken for the first time  some still maintained gamow shapleys assertions that the ocean had nothing in common with life  that it was not a  para  or  prebiological  formation  but a geological formation  certainly not very common  and capable only of stabilising the orbit of solaris  despite the variation in the forces of attraction  to support the argument  they referred to le chateliers law 

  22  

 in contrast to this conservative attitude  new hypotheses were put forward   including that of civito vitta  one of the most elaborate   proclaiming that the ocean was the result of a dialectical development  from its first form as a pre ocean  a solution of slowly reacting chemical bodies  and by force of circumstance  the changes of orbit threatening its existence   it had reached the stage of  homeostatic ocean  in a single leap  without passing through all the stages of terrestrial evolution  avoiding the unicellular and multicellular phases  plant and animal evolution  and the constitution of a nervous and cerebral system  in other words  unlike terrestrial organisms  it had not adapted to its environment in a few hundred million years  finally giving rise to the first representatives of a species endowed with reason  but had immediately dominated its environment  this was an original point of view  but it was still not known how this colloidal shell could stabilise the orbit of the celestial body  for almost a century  devices had been known that could artificially create fields of attraction and gravitation   the gravitators  but no one could imagine how this shapeless glue could achieve an effect  which the gravitators caused by complicated nuclear reactions and extraordinarily high temperatures  the newspapers of that time  arousing the curiosity of the average reader and the anger of the scientist  were full of the most improbable fables on the subject of the  solaris mystery   one columnist went so far as to claim that the ocean was a distant relative of our electric gymnasts  when  to some extent  the problem was solved  it turned out that the explanation   as was often the case in later solar studies   replaced one enigma with another  perhaps even more surprising one  the observations showed  at least  that the ocean did not act according to the laws of our gravitators  which  moreover  would have been impossible   but succeeded in directly imposing the periodicity of travel  this resulted  among other things  in deviations of the oceans course from the laws of our gravitators 

 in the measurement of time on one and the same meridian of solaris  thus  not only did the ocean know  in a certain sense  the einstein boevia theory  it also knew how to exploit its consequences  although we could not say the same   when this hypothesis was put forward  one of the most violent storms of the century was unleashed in the world of science  venerable  universally accepted theories collapsed  daringly heretical articles invaded the specialist literature   genius ocean  or  gravitating colloid   the question inflamed the minds  all this was happening several years before i was born  when i was a student   new data having been collected in the meantime   it was already generally accepted that life existed on solaris  albeit limited to a single inhabitant    the second volume of hughes and eugel  which i kept flipping through mechanically  began with an ingenious and amusing systematisation  the classification table contained three definitions  type   polythera  order   syncytiality  category   metamorph  it seemed as if we knew of an infinite number of specimens of the species  when in fact there was only one   weighing  it is true  seven hundred trillion tons  under my fingers fluttered colourful figures  picturesque graphs  analytical readings and spectral diagrams  showing the type and rate of fundamental transformations and chemical reactions  quickly  unerringly  the thick volume drew me into the solid ground of mathematical faith  one could conclude that we had acquired a full knowledge of this representative of the metamorphic category  which lay a few hundred metres below the metallic hull of the station  veiled at this moment by the shadows of a night that would last four hours  in fact  not everyone was yet convinced that the ocean was indeed a living creature  and even less  needless to say  that it was sentient  i put the big book back on the table 

 the shelf and picked up the next volume  it was divided into two parts  the first part was devoted to a summary of the innumerable attempts  all of which were aimed at establishing contact with the ocean  at the time of my studies  i remembered perfectly  this establishment of contact was the subject of endless anecdotes  jokes and mockery  compared to the profusion of speculations raised by this problem  medieval scholasticism seemed a model of luminous evidence  the second part  almost one thousand three hundred pages  consisted solely of the bibliography relating to the subject  the texts could not have found a place in the room where i was standing  the first attempts at contact were made by means of specially designed electronic devices  which transformed the stimuli emitted bilaterally  the ocean actively participated in these operations  as it shaped the devices  but all this remained unclear  what exactly was this participation  the ocean was altering some of the components of the submerged instruments  so that the expected rhythm of the discharges was altered and the recording devices reproduced a multitude of signals  fragmentary testimonies of some fantastic activity  which in fact escaped any analysis  did the data reflect a momentary state of stimulation  or constant pulses  related to the gigantic structures that the ocean was creating somewhere far away from the researchers location  had the electronic devices recorded the impenetrable manifestation of the oceans venerable secrets  had it delivered its masterpieces to us  how could we know  the stimulus had not provoked two identical reactions  sometimes the devices almost burst under the violence of the impulses  sometimes there was absolute silence  in short  it was impossible to obtain a repetition of any previously observed manifestation  constantly  it seemed as if the growing mass of recorded clues was about to be deciphered  had not electronic brains of practically unlimited information capacity been built for this purpose  such that no one could be sure of the results 

 no other problem had ever required one before  in fact  results were obtained  the ocean   the source of electrical  magnetic and gravitational impulses   was expressed in a kind of mathematical language  so  by appealing to one of the most abstract branches of analysis  the law of large numbers  it was possible to classify certain frequencies of current discharges  structural homologies appeared  already observed by physicists in the sector of science that takes into consideration the reciprocal relationships of energy and matter  of components and compounds  of the finite and the infinite  this correspondence convinced the scientists that they were in the presence of a monster endowed with reason  of an oceanic protoplasmic brain  enveloping the whole planet and wasting its time in extravagant theoretical considerations on universal reality  our devices  by surprise  had captured the infinitesimal snippets of a formidable monologue  which was eternally unfolding in the depths of this disproportionate brain and which  necessarily  exceeded our understanding  so much for the mathematicians  these hypotheses  according to some  underestimated the possibilities of the human mind  we bowed to the unknown  proclaiming an old doctrine  insolently exhumed  ignoramus et ignorabimus  others thought that the mathematicians hypotheses were nothing but sterile and dangerous drivel  because they contributed to the creation of a contemporary mythology  based on the giant brain   electronic or plastic  it doesnt matter   considered as the ultimate objective of existence and sum of life  others    but there were many scientists and everyone had their own opinion  if one compares the field of contact testing with other branches of solarist studies  where specialisation had developed strongly  especially in the last quarter of a century  one finds that a cybernetic solarist could hardly be heard by a symmetriadological solarist  veubeke  the director of the institute when i was a student  once jokingly asked   how can you communicate with the ocean when you yourself

  26  

 can no longer understand each other  there was a good deal of truth in the joke  the decision to classify the ocean as a metamorphic was not an arbitrary one  its undulating surface could give rise to extremely diverse formations  unlike anything seen on earth  and the function   adaptation  recognition or otherwise   of these sudden eruptions of plasma creativity remained an enigma  lifting the heavy volume with both hands  i put it back on the shelf and told myself that our scholarship  all the information accumulated in the libraries  was a useless jumble  a quagmire of evidence and supposition  and that we had not progressed one inch since the beginning of the research seventy eight years earlier  that the situation was much worse than in the pioneer days  since the assiduous efforts of so many years had led to no indisputable certainty  our precise body of knowledge was strictly negative  the ocean did not use machines  on certain occasions  however  it seemed capable of constructing them  during the first and second years of exploration it had reproduced the elements of some immersed apparatus  afterwards it simply ignored the experiments which we pursued with benedictine patience  as if it had lost all interest in our instruments and activities  as if  therefore  it had lost interest in us   it had no nervous system   i continue to chart our negative knowledge   no cells  and its structure was not protean  it did not always react to even the most powerful stimuli  for example  it completely  ignored  the catastrophic accident that occurred during gieses second expedition  an auxiliary rocket  falling from a height of three hundred thousand metres  crashed on the surface of the planet  the radioactive explosion of its nuclear reserves destroying the plasma in a radius of two thousand five hundred metres

 gradually  the solaris affair came to be regarded as a lost game in scholarly circles  particularly among the administrators of the institute  where voices had recently been raised suggesting that the funds be cut and research suspended  no one had dared to speak of a definitive liquidation of the station until then  such a decision would have been too obvious a defeat  moreover  in informal talks  many of our scientists advocated abandoning the solaris affair in as honourable a manner as possible  many scientists  however  especially among the young  came to see the case as a touchstone of individual values  all things considered   they said   the issue is not just about penetrating the solarist civilisation  it is essentially about us  about the limits of human knowledge   for a while the opinion prevailed  spread zealously by the daily press  that the  thinking ocean  of solaris was a gigantic brain  prodigiously developed  and millions of years ahead of our own civilisation  a kind of  cosmic yogi   a sage  a figure of omniscience  who had long since realised the vanity of all activity and who  for that reason  now retreated into unshakable silence  the opinion was inaccurate  for the living ocean was acting  not  of course  according to human notions  it was not building cities or bridges  it was not constructing flying machines  it was not trying to abolish distances and was not concerned with the conquest of space  the decisive criterion  according to some  of mans undoubted superiority   the ocean was undergoing innumerable transformations  an ontological self metamorphosis   there is no shortage of scholarly terms in the record of solarist activities  on the other hand  any scientist who studies the multiple solariana experiences the irresistible impression that he perceives fragments of an intelligent  perhaps genial construction  mixed without order with absurd productions  apparently generated by the

 delirium  thus was born  in contrast to the  ocean yogi  conception  the idea of the  ocean debilitated   these hypotheses unearthed one of the oldest philosophical problems   the relationship between matter and spirit  mind and consciousness  du haart was not lacking in audacity when he was the first to argue that the ocean was endowed with consciousness  the problem  which methodologists were quick to declare metaphysical  gave rise to a great deal of discussion and argument  was it possible for thought to be deprived of consciousness  moreover  could the processes observed in the ocean be called thought  is a mountain a very large rock  is a planet a huge mountain  one remained free to choose ones terminology  but the new scale of size introduced new standards and new phenomena  the question presented itself as a contemporary transposition of the problem of squaring the circle  every independent thinker tried to fit his personal contribution into the treasure trove of solar studies  new theories abounded  the ocean was a state of degeneration  of regression  following a phase of  intellectual plenitude   it was a rambling neoplasm  derived from the bodies of the planets previous inhabitants  all of which it had devoured  swallowed up  and whose residues it had melted into that eternal  self replicating form of a supracellular element  in the white light of the fluorescent tubes  a pallid imitation of the brightness of an earthly day  i cleared the table of the devices and books that cluttered it  on the plastic tray i unrolled the map of solaris and contemplated it  with my arms outstretched and my hands resting on the chrome edge of the table  the living ocean had its shoals and trenches  its islands  covered with a decaying mineral deposit  were surely the nature of the ocean floor   did it order the eruption and subsidence of the rock formations buried in its abyss  no one knew  looking at the great flat projection of the two hemispheres  variegated with various shades of blue and purple  i felt the poignant astonishment which had seized me long ago 

 i had often felt as a child at school when i learned of the existence of solaris  lost in the contemplation of this astonishing map  i thought of nothing more than the mystery surrounding  s death or the uncertainty of my own future  the different sections of the ocean were named after the scientists who had explored them  i was studying the thexall bulge  which bathed the equatorial archipelagos  when i had the sudden sensation that someone was watching me  i was leaning over the map  but i could no longer see it  an invincible numbness came over all my limbs  crates and a small cupboard barricaded the door in front of me  its a robot  i thought   i hadnt found any in the room  and none could have got in without my knowledge  the skin on the back of my neck was beginning to burn  the weight of that heavy  unmoving gaze was becoming unbearable  with my head buried in the hollow of my shoulders  i leaned harder and harder against the table  which began to slide slowly  this movement freed me  i swung around  the room was empty  in front of me there was only the wide  bulging window and the night beyond  but the same sensation persisted  the night was watching me  the amorphous  blind  immense  boundless night  no stars lit up the darkness behind the glass  i drew the opaque curtains  i had not been in the station for an hour and i was already showing morbid signs  was this an effect of  s death  as i knew him  i had judged until then that nothing could ever disturb his mind  i was no longer so sure  i stood in the middle of the room  beside the table  my breathing was calming  i could feel the sweat cooling on my forehead  what had i been thinking about a moment ago  ah  yes   the robots  i was surprised that i hadnt come across any anywhere  where had they all gone  the only one id been in touch with   by far   was in the vehicle reception area  but the others  i looked at my watch  it was time to join    i stepped outside  filaments of light  running under the ceiling  dimly lit the rotunda  i approached the door of

 i approached the   door and stood still for a long time  silence  silence everywhere  i pressed the handle  in reality  i had no intention of entering  the handle went down  the door opened  revealing a black slot  and then the lights came on  i crossed the threshold quickly and quietly closed the door  then i turned round  with my shoulders i brushed the door panel  the room was larger than mine  a curtain with small pink and blue flowers  probably brought from earth with the personal effects and not foreseen in the station equipment  veiled three quarters of the panoramic window  along the walls were shelves  separated by cupboards  both glazed in pale green enamel with silver highlights  the bookcases and cupboards had been emptied of their contents  which lay in heaps between the stools and armchairs  at my feet  blocking the passage  two rolling tables were overturned  buried under a heap of periodicals escaping from crammed briefcases  which had burst  books  with their leaves spread out in a fan shape  were stained with multicoloured liquids  which had been spilled by corroded retorts and flasks  glass containers so thick that a simple fall  even from a considerable height  could not have shattered them  under the window lay a desk  crushing with its mass a work lamp with a movable arm  two legs of an overturned stool sank into the half open drawers  a veritable tide of papers of all sizes  covered with handwritten characters  flooded the floor  i recognised  s handwriting and bent down  as i lifted the loose sheets i noticed that my hand was casting a double shadow  i straightened up  the pink curtain flamed  with a bluish white glowing line running through it  and widening  i lifted the curtain   an unbearable blaze was advancing over the horizon  chasing an army of spectral shadows  rising from the waves and stretching towards the station  it was dawn  after the interlude of an hour of night  the second sun of the planet  the blue sun  was rising in the sky  when i returned to my pile of papers  the automatic switch turned off the lights  i came across the description

 i came across a precise description of an experiment  decided upon three weeks before    intended to expose the plasma to an extremely intense x ray radiation  from the text i understood that it was intended for    who was to organise the operations  i was holding a copy of the project in my hand  the whiteness of the sheets hurt my eyes  this new day was different from the previous one  in the warm orange sunlight  russet mists hovered over the bloody black ocean  almost constantly veiling the waves  the clouds  the sky with a crimson screen  now the blue sun shone through the flower printed fabric with a quartz light  my tanned hands looked grey  the room had changed  all the red hued objects had faded  turned grey brown  while the white  green and yellow objects had become brighter and seemed to emit their own light  blinking  i took another look through the slit in the curtain  an expanse of flowing metal vibrated and pulsed under a sky of white flames  i lowered my eyelids and stepped back  on the shelf of the washbasin  the edge of which was chipped  i found a pair of large black glasses  they covered half my face  the curtain now radiated a sodium light  i continued reading  picking up the sheets and arranging them on the only table that was still usable  there were gaps in the text  i searched the scattered pages in vain  getting hold of the reports of experiments already undertaken  i learned that for four consecutive days   and   had subjected the ocean to radiation at a point fourteen hundred miles from the present position of the station  the use of x rays was forbidden by a un convention because of their harmful effect  and i was sure that no one had sent a request to earth for permission to carry out such experiments  i looked up and saw my image in the mirror of a half open cupboard door  a pale face masked by dark glasses  the room  with its white and blue reflections  looked strange too  but soon i heard a prolonged creak and the shutters outside  sealed 

 slid past the window  there was a moment of darkness  then the lamps came on  which seemed strangely dim  it was getting hotter and hotter  the steady output of the air conditioning units sounded like an exasperated yelp  the stations refrigeration units were working at full capacity  however  the oppressive heat kept rising  i heard footsteps  someone was walking in the rotunda  in two silent jumps i was near the door  the footsteps slowed down  the stranger was behind the door  the handle came down  without thinking  mechanically  i grasped it  the pressure did not increase  it did not weaken  no one on either side of the door raised their voice  each of us held the handle and stayed like that for a while  suddenly the handle rose up  slipping from my hands  the muffled footsteps went away  i listened again  my ear to the panel  but i heard nothing more
