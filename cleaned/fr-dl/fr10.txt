the next day  after lunch  i found a note from   on my table    had postponed the construction of the annihilator and was about to project a powerful beam of rays into the ocean one last time       my dear  i must go to    the red dawn blazed through the window and divided the room into two parts  we stood in a region of blue shadow  beyond this shadowy area  everything was coppery  if a book had fallen from its shelf  my ear would instinctively have been alert for a metallic ringing    this is the experience  only i dont know how to do it  you see  id rather    i interrupted myself       you dont have to justify yourself  i would so much like to    if it didnt last too long    it will be for a while  listen  do you think you could wait in the hallway    ill try  what if i cant control myself    what exactly do you feel    i added hastily  im not asking you out of indiscretion  dont get me wrong  but if we dig a little deeper  you might find a way to control yourself    im afraid   she said    she had turned pale    i cant even explain to you what im afraid of  because im not actually afraid of anything or anyone  i    i feel lost  and i feel terribly ashamed of myself  then when you come back  its over  thats why i thought it was a disease    she was talking in a low voice and shaking 

   maybe its only in this damned station that you have terrors  ill make sure we get out of here in a hurry  she widened her eyes   do you think thats possible    why not  im not a prisoner here  ill have to talk to    how long do you think you can be alone    she lowered her head  if i hear your voice  i think ill manage to stay put    id rather you didnt hear us  i have nothing to hide from you  but i dont know  i cant know  what   will say    dont go on  i understand  ill keep my distance  its enough that i recognise the sound of your voice    ill phone him from the workshop  im not locking the doors    nodded  i walked through the red zone  in contrast  and despite the lamps  the corridor seemed dark  the door to the workshop was open  the last traces of the nights events were the debris of the deware bottle glowing under a row of liquid oxygen tanks  as i lifted the receiver  the small screen lit up  i dialled the number of the radio booth  behind the dull glass  the bluish film of light burst forth  leaning sideways over the arm of a chair    looked me in the eye    hi   he said    i found your ticket  id like to talk to you  can i come over    yes  you can  right now    yes  excuse me  are you coming alone or    with someone    alone  throwing forward his forehead  barred with thick wrinkles  his thin  burnt cheeks  he examined me through the curved glass   a strange fish in a strange aquarium  he said with a knowing look   well  well  im waiting for you 

 when i went into my room i could vaguely make out  s figure beyond the curtain of red rays    we can go now  my dear     my voice failed me    was sitting in an armchair  her arms folded under the armrests  had she heard my steps too late  for a second i saw her struggle against the incomprehensible force within her  overcoming the horrible contraction of her whole body and finally relaxing  a blind fury  mixed with pity  suffocated me  in silence  we followed the long corridor with its multicoloured walls   the variety of colours  according to the architects  was supposed to facilitate our existence inside the armoured carapace  from a distance i saw that the door of the radio booth was ajar  showing a band of red light  i looked at    who did not even attempt to smile  all the way here she had been preparing for a fight with herself  and now that the ordeal was approaching  her face was pale  shrunken  fifteen paces from the door she stopped  i turned round and she pushed me with her fingertips  at once    my plans  the experience  the station  all seemed paltry compared to the ordeal she was about to undergo  i didnt feel like a helper  i wanted to turn back  but a shadow cut off the reflection of the sun on the wall and i hurried into the cabin    had come to the door  as if he had intended to come out to meet me  the sun disk haloed him in a crimson glow  which seemed to radiate from his grey hair  we looked at each other for a moment without saying anything  he could study me at his leisure  but i could not see him  for i was dazzled by the glare of the window  i walked past   and went to lean against a high desk  from which the flexible rods of the microphones emerged    turned slowly and continued to observe me with his usual smile  a grimace which did not express gaiety and more often than not betrayed unspeakable fatigue  with his eyes still fixed on me  he made his way through the heaps of objects piled up in disorder   thermal accumulators  instruments  spare parts for

 radio installation  he approached a metal cupboard  pulled up a stool and sat down with his back against the cupboard door  i listened with concern  there was no sound from the corridor where i had left    why was   silent  the silence between us was becoming awkward  i cleared my throat   when will you be ready    we could start today  but the recording takes some time    recording  you mean the encephalogram    yes  you agreed    whats wrong    no  nothing  the silence continued again and   resumed    did you have something to tell me  i whispered    she knows    he frowned    ah  i had the impression that he wasnt really surprised  so why was he acting surprised  i lost all desire to confide in him  she began to suspect something since our conversation in the library  she spied on me  she added up the clues  then she found  s tape recorder and listened to the tape    with his back against the cupboard  he didnt move  but a faint glint came into his eyes  standing beside the desk  i had the panel of the door ajar to the corridor in front of me  i lowered my voice again   last night  while i was sleeping  she tried to kill herself  there was a rustle of papers being blown away by a draught  i stopped talking  listening to what was happening in the corridor  the noise was not coming from the corridor  it was in the room  a mouse    a mouse  nonsense  there were no mice here  on the sly i watched my companion    im listening   he said quietly 

   obviously  she didnt make it    at least she knows who she is    why are you telling me this  i didnt know what to say at the time  and then i mumbled    to inform you    to tell you about the situation      i warned you  in spite of myself  i raised my voice    you mean you knew      what you just told me  of course not  but i explained the situation to you  when he arrives  the visitor is more or less empty  hes just a ghost fed with confused memories and images  taken from his    adam  the longer he stays with you  the more humanised he becomes  he also becomes more independent  to a certain extent    stopped  glanced up and down at me and reluctantly added   she knows everything    yes  ive already told you    she knows everything  she knows that she came here once and that you      no  he smiled    look     if youre at this point    what do you want to do  do you want to leave the station    yes    with her    yes  he was silent  pondering his answer  but his silence also meant something else    what  again i heard near me   without being able to place it and as if behind a thin wall   the rustle of an insensible air current in the room    shifted on his stool    very well  he said  what are you looking at me for  did you think i would stand in your way  my dear    you can do what you like  with the worries we have  were not going to use coercion against each other on top of everything else  with no hope of you

 convince you  i want to tell you this  in an inhumane situation  you try to keep a human attitude  this may be very nice  but it will get you nowhere  in fact  i am not so sure that it is beautiful  how can silly behaviour be beautiful  thats not the point  lets get back to business  youre not going to continue with the experiments  you want to leave and take him with you  yes    yes    its also    an experiment  have you thought about it    what do you mean  as long as shes with me  i dont see    speaking more and more slowly  i stopped in the middle of my sentence    sighed    we are all practising an ostrich policy  my dear    and we know it  theres no need to put on a chivalrous air    im not putting on any airs    im sorry  i didnt mean to hurt your feelings  im taking off the chivalrous airs  but im keeping the ostrich policy  which you are practising in a particularly dangerous form  you lie to yourself  you lie to her  and you go around in circles  do you know the conditions for stabilising a neutrino structure    no  and neither do you  nobody does    thats right  we only know that such a structure is unstable and can only survive with a continuous flow of energy  i learned this from    this energy creates a swirling stabilisation field  is this magnetic field external to the visitor  or is it created inside his body  do you understand the difference    yes    if it is external    she      concludes for me    away from solaris  the structure disintegrates  pure hypothesis  of course  but one you can verify  since you have already tried an experiment  the rocket you launched    it continues to gravitate  in my spare time  i have even calculated

 the elements of its movement  you can take off  place yourself in orbit  approach and see what has become of the passenger    i shouted    you are mad    i shouted   youre mad    do you think so  what if we brought that rocket back here  no problem  its remote controlled  well get it out of orbit and      shut up    no  you dont want to do that either  there is still a way  very simple  it wont be necessary to bring it back to the station  it will continue to gravitate  it will be enough to establish a radio link  if she lives  she will answer and      but    but she ran out of oxygen a long time ago    maybe it doesnt need oxygen  shall we try              he angrily monkeyed with me              think about it  are you a man or not  who are you trying to please  who are you trying to save  you  her  and which one  this one or that one  dont you have enough courage to face them both  you can see that your behaviour is inconsiderate  im telling you for the last time  we are in a situation that is beyond morality  i heard the same rustling sound as before  and this time it sounded as if fingernails were scratching a wall  i dont know why i suddenly felt as passive and indifferent as a mule  i saw myself  i saw both of us from a great distance  through the small end of a spyglass  and everything seemed insignificant  negligible  a little laughable  i asked   well  what do you think i should do  send her away  tomorrow shell be back  wont she  and the day after  and every day after that  for how long  whats the point of getting rid of her if she comes back  what good will it do me  and what benefit to you  to    to the station 

   no  heres what i suggest  go with her  you will witness the transformation  after a few minutes  youll see    without enthusiasm  i interrupted him    what  a monster  a demon    no  you will see her die  quite simply  do you really believe in her immortality  i assure you they die    what will you do then  come back here    and replenish your supplies  clenching my fists  i shouted    shut up  his eyelids wrinkled  he looked at me with condescending mockery    oh  im the one who has to shut up  it wasnt me who started this conversation  and i think its gone on long enough  i would advise you to have other fun  you could  for example  go and whip the ocean with a rod  to get back at him  what do you think  that you are a scoundrel  if you send him away     he waved his hand in a mocking farewell gesture and raised his head towards the ceiling  as if he were watching a rocket taking off    and that youre an honest man  if you keep it  to smile when you feel like moaning  to pretend to be happy and peaceful when you want to bang your head against the walls  isnt that being a scoundrel  and if it is impossible  here  not to be a scoundrel  what are you going to do  rage against that scoundrel    who is responsible for everything  yes   then  my dear    to make matters worse  you really are a complete idiot  with my chin down  i replied   you speak for yourself    i    love him    who  his memory    no  her  i told you what she wanted to do  few genuine    human beings would have had the courage to do that    by your own words  you acknowledge    dont argue with me about the words    dont argue with me about the words    fine  so she loves you  and you want to love her  it is not the same thing    you are mistaken 

   im sorry     but it was you who told me your intimate concerns  you dont love her  you love her  she is ready to give her life  so are you  its very moving  its beautiful  its sublime  whatever you want  but here  its inappropriate  this is not the place  do you understand that  no  you refuse to understand  unknown forces  independent of us  are pulling you into a circular process  of which she is an aspect  a phase  a periodic manifestation  if she were    if you were bothered by a devoted nanny  you wouldnt hesitate for a moment to send her away  would you    yes  i would    well  thats probably why shes not a nanny  your hands are tied  thats what its all about  your hands being tied    its just one more hypothesis  on top of a million others in the library  leave me alone     shes    no  i dont want to discuss it with you any more    fine  you started it  you started it  just remember that shes a mirror in which part of your brain is reflected  if its wonderful  its because you have wonderful memories  you provided the recipe  you are caught in a circular process  dont forget that    what do you want from me  that i    that i take him away  i already asked you the question  why  you didnt answer    ill answer you  i didnt ask for this conversation  i didnt interfere in your affairs  i dont order you to do anything  i dont forbid you to do anything  and even if i had the right  i wouldnt do it  you came here of your own free will and unpacked everything in front of me  do you know why  no   to unburden yourself  to relieve yourself of a burden  ah  my dear    i know what that burden is  oh  yes  and dont interrupt me  i leave you free to make your own decisions  while you desire opposition  if i stood in your way  you might try to beat me up  but you would be dealing with me  a man made of the same loam as you  a man of the same flesh and blood as you  and then

 you too would feel like a man  as i dont give you the opportunity to fight  you argue with me    or rather  you argue with yourself  you have only to tell me that you would succumb to the pain if it suddenly disappeared    no  please  dont say anything  i replied awkwardly to his attack   i came to inform you  out of simple honesty  that i intend to leave the station with her    shrugged his shoulders    youre not denying it    i only expressed my opinion because i see that youre getting ahead of yourself  and the higher you go  the harder youll fall  as they say    come tomorrow morning  around nine oclock  to   house    will you come  i was astonished    at    i thought he didnt let anyone in  you told me that we couldnt even phone him    it seems that he has arranged it somehow  we never talk about our domestic problems  you    thats entirely different  will you come tomorrow morning  i growled   ill come  i looked at    his left hand had slipped inside the cupboard  how long had the door been ajar  long enough  probably  but in the excitement of this horrible conversation i hadnt noticed  the position of that hand was unnatural  it looked as if he were hiding something  or holding someones hand  i moistened my lips      what are you      get out   he said in a low voice  very quietly   get out  i went out and closed the door in the last light of the red twilight  ten paces from the door    was waiting  sitting on the floor  glued to the wall  she jumped to her feet 

   you see   she said  looking at me with shining eyes  i did it       im so happy  maybe    maybe it will get easier    i answered absent mindedly   oh  yes  surely     we went back to my house  we went back to my place  i had been thinking about that cupboard all along  my cheeks were beginning to burn so badly that i involuntarily stroked them with the back of my hand  what a stupid conversation  and to what end  nothing  ah  yes  tomorrow morning    suddenly  fear seized me  a fear similar to the one i had felt the night before  my encephalogram  the complete record of my brain processes  transformed into a beam of rays  would be discharged into the ocean  into the depths of this inconceivable  infinite monster    what had   said   if it disappeared  you would suffer horribly  an encephalogram is a record of all processes   conscious and unconscious processes  if i want it to go away  will it go away  but if i wished to get rid of it  would i be as frightened by the thought of its threatened annihilation  am i responsible for my unconscious  but who else would be responsible for it  why did i agree to give them my encephalogram    i can obviously study the recording before allowing it to be used  but i wont be able to decipher it  no one can decipher it  specialists can only circumscribe the subjects thoughts in general terms  they will say  for example  that the subject was thinking about the solution of a mathematical problem  but will be unable to specify the data of this problem  they are forced to stick to generalities  they say  because the encephalogram reproduces a multitude of processes taking place simultaneously  only some of which have a psychic  double   what about unconscious processes  the specialists absolutely refuse to talk about them  how can we expect them to decipher

 but what am i so afraid of  i told   this very morning that the experiment will not succeed  if our neurophysiologists are unable to decipher the recording  how can this stranger  this black and fluid giant  be able to do so  he has penetrated me  however  without my knowledge  he has probed my memory and discovered my most sensitive point  how can i doubt it  without any help  without any ray transmission  he broke through the hermetic armour  the double shell of the station  found me and took his booty         standing at the window  staring  i didnt see the night coming  a thin ceiling of high clouds  a silver dome dimly reflecting the vanished sun  veiled the stars  if she disappears after the experience  it will mean that i wanted her gone  that i killed her  no  i will not go up to    i dont have to obey them  what will i tell them  the truth  no  i cant tell them the truth  i will have to act  lie  again and again    because there may be thoughts  intentions  cruel hopes in me of which i know nothing  because i am a murderer who does not know himself  man has set out to discover other worlds  other civilizations  without having fully explored his own abyss  his labyrinth of dark corridors and secret chambers  without having penetrated the mystery of the doors he himself has condemned  leave   to them    out of modesty  to abandon him only because i lack courage        said    even lower  she had come closer to me  i pretended not to have heard her  at that moment  i wanted to isolate myself  i had to isolate myself  i had not yet decided anything  made any resolution  i stood still  looking up at the black sky  at the cold stars  the pale ghosts of the stars that shone above the earth  my head was suddenly empty of all thought  all that remained was the dreary certainty that i had irretrievably crossed a border  indifferent  i refused to know that i was on my way to the unattainable and i no longer had the strength to despise myself
