The light roused me from sleep in the middle of the night  A hand in visor  I raised myself on the elbow  Wrapped in a sheet  her hair in her face  Harey had curled up at the foot of the bed  His shoulders were shaking  She was crying silently   Harey     She withdrew further into herself   Harey  whats wrong with you   I sat up  half awake  still overwhelmed by the nightmare that tormented me a moment earlier  She continued to shake  I stretched out my arms  She pushed me away and hid her face   Harey  my love    Shut up   Harey   Whats the matter   She showed her wet  quivering face  Big tears  childish tears  ran down the cheeks  sparkled in the dimple above the chin  dripped onto the sheet    You do not want me    What are you inventing    I heard  I felt the muscles in my jaw contracting   What did you hear   You did not understand       I understood  I understood very well  You said its not me  You want me to go  I would leave  my God  I would go  but I cant  I do not know why  I tried to leave  I can not  Im so  so cowardly    Come on  my little one  I seized her  I hugged her against me with all my strength  She alone mattered to me  the rest crumbled  I kissed her hands  her fingers wet with tears  I spoke to her  I begged her to listen to me  I begged her indulgence  I repeated oaths  I told her that she had had a stupid dream  a horrible dream  She gradually calmed down  She stopped crying  His eyes were huge  sleepwalker eyes  She turned her head away    No  she said  shut up  dont talk like that  you mustnt  You are not the same for me     I let out a moan    What   No  you dont want me  I understood that a long time ago  I pretended not to notice anything  I thought maybe I was making up my mind  But no  youre not the same anymore  You dont take me seriously  A dream   Yes  its true  but it was you who dreamed  and you dreamed of me  You spoke my name  with revulsion  Why   Why     I knelt down  I hugged his legs    My little       I do not want you to talk to me like that  I dont want to  you hear  I am not your child  I am not a child  Im   She burst into tears and let herself fall  her face in the pillow  I got up  The fans hummed softly  I was cold  I threw the bathrobe over my shoulders and sat down next to Harey  I touched his arm   Listen  Harey  I am going to tell you something  I will tell you the truth  She stood up  helping herself with both hands  I could see the veins throbbing under the thin skin of his neck  Again  I felt the muscles in my jaw tense  I was getting colder and colder  My head was completely blank    The truth   Harry asked  Word of honor   With a knot in my throat  I didnt answer right away  Word of honor   our sacred formula  our old formula of oath  The oath thus sealed  neither of us dared  not only to lie  but to keep silent  I remembered the time when we tormented each other  out of excessive concern for sincerity  convinced that this naive quest for the truth preserved our union  I replied gravely   Word of honour   Harey      She was waiting   You too  Harey  have changed  We all change  But thats not what I wanted to tell you  For some reason neither of us knows exactly  it seems  you cant leave me  Its fine with me  because I cant leave you either    Kris  I picked her up  still wrapped in her sheet  A corner of the sheet  soaked in tears  brushed the back of my neck  I paced back and forth rocking Harey  She caressed my cheeks   No  you havent changed  Its me  she whispered in my ear  Something is wrong  Could it be since the accident  She stared at the black  empty rectangle of the doorway  The evening before  I had transported the debris to the warehouse  A new door should be hung  I put Harey on the bed  Leaning over her  I asked   Do you ever sleep     I do not know    How do you not know     I have dreams     I do not know if they are really dreams  I may be sick  I lay there  and I think  and  She shivered  I asked quietly   What    Im having weird thoughts  I dont know where they come from  I asked again    For example  And I say to myself   Whatever she says  stay calm   I braced myself for his answer the way one braces for a blow  Distraught  she shook her head   These are thoughts  around me    I dont understand   I have the impression that they are not only inside me  but beyond  I cant explain it to you  I cant find the words  I cut off  almost in spite of myself    These are surely dreams    Then I caught my breath and continued  Now we will turn off the light and  until morning  no more sorrows  Tomorrow morning  if you want  well invent new ones   okay  She pressed the switch  darkness separated us  I lay down on the bed  a warm breath approached me  I hugged her  she murmured    Louder    And  after a long time  Kris    What     I like you  I almost screamed  The morning was red  The swollen disk of the sun rose above the horizon  A letter was waiting for me  placed on the threshold  I tore the envelope  I could hear Harey humming in the bathroom  From time to time  she stuck her head inside the room and showed me her face covered with wet hair  I walked to the window and read   Kelvin  its starting up   Sartorius decided on a vigorous treatment  He believes he will succeed in destabilizing the neutrino structures  He would like to examine a certain quantity of F plasma subjected to peripheral transport  He suggests that you scout out and take a certain amount of plasma with you in the capsule  You be the judge  but let me know your decision  I have no opinion  It seems to me that I have nothing left  If I prefer that you accept  it is that we will at least have the impression of taking a step forward  Otherwise  it only remains to envy G  YOUR OLD RAT  P S  Dont go into the radio booth   thats all I ask of you  You can phone  My heart sank reading this letter  I skimmed through it again carefully  then tore it up and threw the pieces of paper into the sink  I choose a jumpsuit for Harey  I repeated the gestures of the abominable comedy I had imagined the other day  But Harey knew nothing  When I told her that I had to go on reconnaissance  and that I offered to accompany me  she was very happy about this trip  We stopped in the kitchen  together we prepared breakfast  Harey ate very little  The meal finished  I headed for the library and Harey followed me  Before accomplishing Sartorius desired mission  I wanted to take a look at the literature dealing with magnetic fields and neutrino structures  Without knowing yet how I was going to proceed  I had decided to exercise control over the work of the eminent physicist  Of course  I tell myself  when the annihilator is ready  I wont prevent Snaut and Sartorius from  freeing themselves   I could take Harey  and wed wait for the end of the operation somewhere outside the Station   in the cabin of a flying vehicle  I was toiling over the big computer  sometimes he responded to my operations by ejecting a card on which was read the laconic inscription  Lack in the catalogue   sometimes he suggested drowning me under such a cataract of highly specialized physics books that I hesitated to take advantage of his advice  However  I did not want to leave the vast circular room  I felt good in my egg  between those rows of drawers stuffed with microfilms and electrical recordings  Located in the very center of the Station  the library had no windows  it was the most insulated place inside the steel carcass  This  no doubt  is why I experienced such a pleasant sensation  despite the manifest failure of my research  Wandering through the huge room  I stood in front of a shelving that rose to the ceiling and whose shelves held about six hundred volumes  all the classics relating to the history of Solaris  starting with the nine volumes of the monograph monumental and already relatively outdated by Giese  It was certainly not an ostentatious display  highly unlikely here  but a respectful tribute to the memory of the pioneers  I took out the heavy volumes of Giese and  having sat down on the arm of an armchair  I began to leaf through them  Harey  too  had found reading  over his shoulder  I deciphered a few lines  She had chosen one of the many books taken on the first expedition  The Interplanetary Cook  a volume that may have belonged personally to Giese  Harey studied with attention the culinary recipes adapted to the severe conditions of cosmonautics  I said nothing and went back to the valuable work I was holding on my knees  Solaris   Ten Years of Exploration had appeared in the Solariana collection  volumes 4 to 13  while the numbering of the latest works published in the same collection had four digits  Giese lacked lyricism  but  in the study of Solaris  a lyrical point of view can only hinder the explorer  Imagination and premature assumptions are especially harmful when it comes to a planet where  ultimately  anything is possible  It is very likely that the implausible descriptions of the  plasmatic  metamorphoses of the ocean faithfully translate the observed phenomena  although these descriptions are unverifiable  because the ocean rarely repeats itself  The strange character  the gigantism of these phenomena fills with horror the one who contemplates them for the first time and who would consider analogous phenomena as a simple  caprice of nature    an accidental manifestation of blind forces   if he observed them at a reduced scale  in some quagmire  In short  the genius and the mediocre mind are equally perplexed by the inexhaustible diversity of solarist formations   no man has really familiarized himself with the phenomena of the living ocean  Giese was not a mediocre mind  not a genius either  He was a pedantic classifier  one whom tireless hard work completely absorbs and preserves from the tumults of life  He used a relatively banal descriptive language  which he supplemented with terms of his own invention  which were insufficient  even unfortunate  But  lets face it honestly  no terminology can express what is happening on Solaris  The tree mountains  the longus  the fungosities  the mimoids  symetriads and asymmetriads  the vertebridae and the agilus have a terribly artificial linguistic physiognomy  these bastard terms  however  give an idea of Solaris to anyone who has only ever seen the planet in blurry photographs and very imperfect films  In reality  despite his circumspection  our scrupulous classifier has more than once sinned by imprudence  Man never ceases to make hypotheses  even when he distrusts them and believes himself to be safe from temptation  Giese believed that the  longus  constituted a category of fundamental forms  he compared them to accumulations of gigantic waves and compared the formation of the  longus  with the flow movements of our terrestrial oceans  It suffices  moreover  to refer to the first edition of his work  to see that he had first called them  flows   inspired by a geocentrism that one might consider amusing  if one did not realize that this geocentrism explicitly betrays the scholars embarrassment  From the moment that we seek to establish comparisons with the Earth  it must be specified that the  longus  are formations whose dimensions exceed those of the great canyon of Colorado  that they occur in a material which on the surface has an appearance frothy colloid  during this fantastic  work  the foam congeals into scallops of starched lace with enormous meshes  some scholars speak of  ossified chancres    while in depth the substance becomes more and more firm  like a bent muscle  a muscle that about fifteen meters from the surface is hard as a rock and yet retains its flexibility  The  longus  itself  an apparently independent creation  stretches for miles   between distended membranous walls to which the  ossified excrescences  cling   colossal python  which would have devoured mountains and which silently digests  printing from time to time time to her crawling body a slow vibrating movement  The  longus  presents this appearance of passive reptile only when it is flown very high  When you approach it  and the two  walls of the ravine  dominate the flying machine by a few hundred meters  you notice that this inflated cylinder  stretched to the horizon  is animated by a movement dizzy  We first notice the continuous rotational movement of a sort of grey green sludge  which violently reflects the rays of the sun  but  if the device descends further until it almost touches the  back of the python   the edges of the  ravine  sheltering the  longus  are then similar to the ridges which border a geological depression   we note that it is acts with a much more complicated movement  made of concentric eddies  where darker currents cross  at certain times  this  cloak  becomes a shiny crust  reflecting the sky and the clouds  and immediately riddled by the explosive eruptions of internal gases and fluids  Little by little  we understand that there resides the center of the forces which separate and lift towards the sky the two gelatinous slopes in the process of slowly crystallizing  but science does not accept such evidence without further proof  Virulent discussions have continued over the years on a priority theme  what exactly happens inside the  longus   which criss cross the immensities of the living ocean by the millions  Organic functions were attributed to these  longus   they assumed  according to some  processes of transformation of matter  respiratory processes  some voices suggested  or else  their function was to transport food materials  The dust of libraries has buried the infinite repertoire of suppositions  Tedious  sometimes dangerous experiments eliminated all these hypotheses  Today  we only speak of  longus   relatively simple and stable formations  whose duration of existence is measured in weeks   an exceptional feature among the phenomena observed on the planet  The  mimoids  are notably more complex formations  more whimsical  and which provoke in the observer a more vehement reaction   an instinctive reaction  it goes without saying  One can say  without exaggeration  that Giese had fallen in love with the  mimoids   to which he was not long in devoting all of his time  until the end of his life  he studied them  described them and contrived to define their nature  By the name he gave to these phenomena  he wanted to express their most disturbing characteristic   the imitation of objects  near or far  outside the ocean  One fine day  we can see  buried under the surface of the ocean  a large flattened disc  frayed  and as if coated with tar  After a few hours  the disc begins to break down into sheets  which gradually rise  The observer then believes he is witnessing a furious struggle  From all directions run up in serried ranks powerful waves  like convulsed lips  fleshy jaws  which open eagerly above this jagged and wavering puff pastry  then sink into the depths  Each time a crater of waves crashes and engulfs  the fall of this mass of hundreds of thousands of tons is accompanied  for a second  by a viscous roar  a monstrous clap of thunder  The bituminous laminate is pushed down  jostled  dismembered  with each new attack  circular films scatter and hover  undulating and languid wings  under the surface of the ocean  they are transformed into pear shaped clusters  into long necklaces  merge together and rise  carrying in their folds lumpy fragments of the base of the primitive disc  while around the waves continue to crash on the sides of a crater which goes expanding  The phenomenon can last a day  it can last a month  and  sometimes  it remains without follow up  Giese the conscientious had called this first variant  aborted mimoid   because he was convinced that each of these cataclysms aimed at an ultimate end  the  major mimoid   a colony of polyparies  the whole of which exceeded the area of a city   pale growths affected to imitate forms outside the ocean  Uyvens  on the other hand  considered this last phase to be a degeneration  a necrosis  according to him  the appearance of  copies  corresponded to a localized loss of the forces specific to the ocean  which no longer mastered the original forms it had created  Giese  however  stubbornly saw in the different phases of the process a continuous step towards perfection  his confidence was all the more surprising because he was usually overly measured and cautious when he proposed   with the boldness of an ant advancing on a frozen waterfall   the slightest hypothesis concerning the other creations of the ocean  Seen from above  the mimoid resembles a city  it is only an illusion  caused by our need to establish analogies with what we know  When the sky is clear  a mass of superheated air covers with a vibrating envelope the flexible structures of the polyparies piled up on top of each other and surmounted by membranous palisades  The first cloud that crosses the azure  I said  azure   but here the sky is purple  or a sinister white during the  blue  day   the first cloud that passes awakens the mimoid  All growths suddenly develop new buds  then the totality of the polyparies projects upwards an ample integument  which expands  swells  swells  discolors and  after a few minutes  imitates to be mistaken the volutes of a cloud  The huge  object  casts a reddish shadow on the mimoid  whose vertices tilt towards each other  this movement always taking place in the opposite direction to that of the movement of the real cloud  If his sacrifice had allowed him to learn why it was so  I suppose Giese would have gladly had his hand cut off  But these  isolated  productions of the mimoid pale in comparison to the impetuous activity it manifests when it is  stimulated  by objects of human origin  The process of reproduction embraces all objects within an eight to nine mile radius  Most often the reproduction is an enlargement of the original  the forms of which are sometimes copied very approximately  The reproduction of machines  above all  gives rise to simplifications that one might consider grotesque  even caricatural  The copy of the object is always modeled in this colorless integument  which hovers above the protuberances  connected at its base only by tenuous umbilical cords  and which slides and crawls  which folds  stretches or swells  and finally takes the most complicated forms  A flying device  a fence or a mast are reproduced at the same speed  The male  however  does not stimulate the mimoid  more precisely  the mimoid does not react to any living matter and never copied  for example  the plants that the researchers had brought with them for the purpose of experiment  On the other hand  the mimoid immediately reproduces a mannequin  a doll in human form  a statuette representing a dog or a tree sculpted in any material  Here  we must point out  parenthetically  that the mimoids  obedience  to solarist experimenters is not evidence of  goodwill  it is not constant  The most evolved mimoid has its days of laziness  where it  lives  in slow motion  where its pulsation weakens  This  pulsation  is  moreover  not discernible with the naked eye and has only been discovered with the help of cinematographic shots  each movement of ebb and flow of the  pulse  extending over two oclock  During these  lazy days   one can easily explore the mimoid  especially if it is old  because the base anchored in the ocean as well as the protuberances of this base have a relative firmness  which allows the man to land safely on the mimoid  One can  in fact  also stay inside the mimoid during its  days of activity   but then the visibility is almost nil  due to a whitish colloidal dust  which spreads continuously through the tears of the integument hanging over the protuberances  Close up  it is impossible to distinguish the shapes reproduced by this integument  because of their gigantic size   the dimensions of the smallest  copy  are those of a mountain  In addition  a thick layer of colloidal snow quickly covers the base of the mimoid  this muddy carpet hardens only after a few hours  the  frozen  crust supports the weight of a man  although it is of a material much lighter than pumice stone   Ultimately  without appropriate equipment  there is a risk of getting lost in the maze of knotty and cracked structures  which sometimes resemble curled up colonnades  sometimes frozen geysers  There is a risk of getting lost even in broad daylight  because the suns rays do not pierce the white ceiling projected into the atmosphere by the  imitative explosions   On auspicious days  auspicious days for the scientist as well as for the mimoid   the observer contemplates an unforgettable spectacle  In these days of hyperproduction  the mimoid indulges in extraordinary  creative booms   He abandons himself to variants on the theme of external objects  which he likes to complicate and from which he develops  formal extensions   he amuses himself thus for hours  for the joy of the non figurative painter and the despair of the scholar  who tries in vain to understand anything about the processes in progress  If  sometimes  the mimoid has  puerile  simplifications  it also has its  baroque deviations   its magnificent crises of extravagance  The old mimoids  in particular  produce very comical forms  Looking at the photographs  however  I was never made to laugh  so overwhelmed was I  each time  by their mystery  During the first years of exploration  we literally threw ourselves on the mimoids   open windows in the ocean  it was said  and which would facilitate the contact ardently hoped for between two civilizations  Quite quickly  we had to admit that the famous contact was not announced in any way  that everything was limited to a reproduction of forms  and that we were trampling on a path leading nowhere  Many scientists  yielding to the temptation of a latent anthropomorphism or zoomorphism  saw in various other formations of the living ocean  sensory organs  or even  limbs    thus scholars  including Maartens and Ekkonai  defined for a time Gieses  vertebrids  and  agilus   If one ventures to declare that these protuberances of the ocean  which shoot up to a height of two miles in the atmosphere  are  limbs   one may as well claim that earthquakes are the  gymnastics  of the earths crust  Three hundred chapters constitute the repertory of the formations which occur regularly on the surface of the living ocean  and which one can observe by tens  even by hundreds  in twenty four hours  Symetriads   according to the terminology and definition of the school of Giese   are the least  human  formations  that is to say  they have no resemblance to anything that man can see on the planet  Earth  At the time when the study of the symetriads began  it was already known that the ocean was not aggressive and that its plasma vortices would swallow up no one but a remarkably reckless and thoughtless individual  I do not speak not  of course  accidents resulting from a failure of the oxygenation system  for example  or air conditioners   One can  in fact  without the slightest danger  cross from side to side with a flying vehicle the cylindrical body of the longus or the fantastic column of vertebridae which oscillate among the clouds  because the plasma deviates at the speed of sound in the air  solarist atmosphere  and clears a passage for the foreign body  deep tunnels open even under the surface of the ocean  the energy instantly deployed for this purpose is prodigious   Skriabin estimated it at approximately 1019 ergs   However  the exploration of the symetriads began with increased caution  guarding against any reckless incursion and multiplying the precautions   often illusory precautions  All the children of the Earth know the name of the first men who ventured into the abysses of a symmetry  The danger of these giant formations does not lie in their appearance  although this can inspire nightmares  Rather  the danger is that within a symmetry there is nothing that is stable or secure in any way   even physical laws are abolished  The explorers of the symetriads   it should be noted   argued more ardently than other scientists for the thesis that the living ocean was endowed with intelligence  The symmetries suddenly arise  The birth of a symmetry is like an eruption  An hour before the  eruption   vitrified over an area of a few tens of square kilometres  the ocean begins to shine  It nevertheless retains its fluidity  and the rhythm of the waves does not change  Sometimes  but not necessarily  this phenomenon of vitrification occurs around the funnel left by an agilus  After an hour  the shining envelope of the ocean flies away and forms a monstrous bubble  which reflects the firmament  the sun  the clouds and the entire horizon  a sheaf of changing and variegated images  The light rays  broken and deflected  create a dazzling play of colors  The light effects on a symmetriad are particularly striking during the blue day and at the red sunset  One then has the impression that the planet is giving birth to a double  which from moment to moment increases in volume  And  suddenly  the immense blazing globe  barely unfolding above the ocean  bursts at its summit and splits vertically  it is not  however  a disaggregation  This second phase  rather inadvertently called the  floral calyx phase   lasts a few seconds  The membranous arches directed towards the sky fold inside and merge into a stocky torso  within which a multitude of phenomena continues  At the center of this torso   explored for the first time by the seventy members of the Hamalei expedition   a gigantic process of polycrystallization erects an axis  commonly called  vertebral column   a term of which I am not a supporter  The vertiginous architectonics of this central pillar is supported in statu nascendi by vertical shafts  of an almost liquid gelatinous consistency  which continuously spring from huge crevices  During this process  the colossus   surrounded by a belt of snowy foam  whose big bubbles are agitated violently   emits a dull and continuous roar  From the center towards the periphery then take place the complicated revolutions of heavy fins  on which thicken trails of ductile matter rising from the depths  Simultaneously  the gelatinous geysers turn into mobile columns projecting tentacles  these bundles of antennae  directed towards points of the structure rigorously determined by the overall dynamics  recall the gills of an embryo and swirl at a fabulous speed  flooded with threads of pink blood and a dark green secretion  almost black  From this moment  symmetry begins to reveal its most extraordinary feature   the ability to  mold  or even negate certain physical laws  Lets say first of all that there are no two identical symmetries and that the geometry of each of them is always a new  invention  of the living ocean  The interior of the symmetry becomes a factory manufacturing  monumental machines   as these creations are frequently called  although they are in no way reminiscent of man made machines  this is an activity with limited ends and therefore somewhat  mechanical   When the geysers springing from the abyss have congealed into columns or into galleries and corridors scattering in all directions  when the  membranes  are fixed in an inextricable arrangement of landings  panels and vaults  the symmetry justifies its name  because the entire structure is divided into two equal parts  each composed in an absolutely similar way  After twenty to thirty minutes   the axis  sometimes  having tilted at an angle of eight to twelve degrees   the giant begins to descend slowly   There are more or less large symetriads  but even the smallest  while the base is already submerged  still reach a height of some eight hundred meters and are visible from several miles away   Then the massive body stabilizes gradually   the inclined axis regains the vertical   and the symmetry  partially submerged  finally comes to a standstill  It is then possible to explore it without danger  by entering  near the summit  through one of the many siphons that pierce the cap  openings of various ducts and channels  The symmetry presents   as a whole   the three dimensional development of some transcendent equation  It is well known that one can express any equation in the figurative language of higher geometry and construct its spatial representation  Symmetry  thus considered  is a relative of Lobachevskys cones and negative Riemann curves  but an extremely distant relative  because of its unimaginable complexity  It offers  in the form of a volume of a few cubic miles  a development of the whole mathematical system and  in fact  a development in four dimensions  because the fundamental terms of the equations are also expressed in time  in the changes that it operates  It would be very natural  of course  to suppose that the symmetry is a  mathematical machine  of the living ocean  a spatial representation   on the scale of the ocean   of the calculations it performs for purposes unknown to us  but nobody  today  any longer accepts this idea of Fermont  The hypothesis  of course  was tempting  however  it turned out to be impossible to maintain the concept of the ocean focusing on examining the problems of matter  the cosmos and existence  with titanic eruptions  the substance of which would participate by each fragment in the infinitely complex expression of a superior analysis  Indeed  multiple phenomena contradict this too simple conception  of a childish naivety  according to some   We have not failed to try to transpose the symmetry  to  illustrate  it  Awerians demonstration was a significant success  Let us imagine  he said  an edifice dating from the splendor of Babylon  but built in a living substance  sensitive and capable of evolving  the architectonics of this edifice goes through a series of phases and takes on the forms of a Greek and then Roman construction before our eyes  the columns  like plant stems  then become thinner  the vault becomes lighter  rises  curves  the arch describes a steep parabola and breaks into a steeple  Gothic was born  it reached its maturity  time flew and new forms took shape  the austerity of the line disappears under the explosions of an orgiastic exuberance  the baroque flourishes without restraint  if the progression continues  always on the understanding that we regard successive mutations as the stages of an evolutionary life  we finally arrive at the architecture of the cosmic epoch  and we may come to understand what a symmetry  However  whatever the developments and improvements brought to the demonstration  an attempt was made to visualize it using models and films   the comparison remains weak  in fact  it is only an escape  if not a deception  since symmetry is unlike anything we have ever seen on Earth  Man can only grasp a few things at a time  we only see what is happening in front of us  here and now  we cannot simultaneously represent to ourselves a succession of processes  however interrelated they may be  however complementary they may be to each other  Our faculties of perception are thus limited even with regard to relatively simple phenomena  One mans destiny can be rich in meaning  one has only a vague idea of the destiny of a few hundred men  but the history of thousands  of millions of men means  properly speaking  nothing at all  Symmetry is a million  no  a billion  raised to the X power   its the incomprehensible  What would we understand  then  of these innumerable naves   each with a capacity of ten Kronecker units   that we explore  like ants  clinging to the folds of the vaults breathing and contemplating the flight of gigantic spans  gray opalescences in the light of our projectors  flexible cupolas which interpenetrate and balance each other infallibly  the perfection of a moment   because everything here passes and flows  movement is the essence of this architecture  a movement concentrated and oriented towards a specific goal  We observe only a fragment of the process  the vibration of a single string of a symphony orchestra of super giants  when we know   we know it  without conceiving it   that above us and below us  in vertiginous abysses  beyond the limits of perception of the eyes and the imagination  thousands and millions transformations take place simultaneously  linked together like a score by a mathematical counterpoint  Someone mentioned geometric symphony   we remain deaf to this concert  To really see something  it would be necessary to move away  to take a considerable step back  but everything takes place within the symmetry   a colossal and proliferating matrix  where creation is incessant  where the created immediately becomes creator  where perfectly identical  twins  are born at antipodes  separated by Babelian scaffoldings and miles of distance  Here  each monumental construction  with a beauty whose accomplishment escapes our sight  is the performer and the leader  the forms collaborate with each other and influence each other in turn  A symphony   yes  a self creating and self terminating symphony  The end of the symmetry is horrible  All the witnesses have the feeling of witnessing a tragedy   a crime  After two or three hours   the process of spontaneous reproduction  of explosive proliferation never lasts any longer   the living ocean goes on the attack  The smooth surface of the ocean comes to life and wrinkles  the dried foam becomes fluid again and begins to bubble  From all horizons come waves in concentric rows  fleshy jaws  incomparably larger than the greedy lips that surround the mimoid at birth  The submerged part of the symmetry is compressed  the colossus rises  as if it were going to be thrown out of the planets zone of attraction  the upper layers of the ocean redouble their activity  the waves soar higher and higher  lick the sides of the symmetry  envelop it  stiffen  block the orifices  and all this is nothing compared to what happens inside the symmetry  First  the process of creation   the evolutionary architectonics   freezes for a brief moment  then there is  panic   The supple movement of interpenetration of forms  the harmonious interplay of planes and lines  rushes  One experiences the overwhelming impression that the colossus  in the face of threatening danger  is trying to hasten some accomplishment  The more the movement of transformations accelerates  the greater becomes the horror inspired by the metamorphosis of symmetry and its dynamics  The admirable flight of the domes softens  the vaults sag and hang   false notes  appear  unfinished  grotesque   crippled  forms  From the invisible depths escapes a mighty rumble  a roar   a breath of air  sigh of agony  jostles in the narrowed channels  hums and thunders  and the crumbled domes groan like so many monstrous gorges  bristling with stalactites of mucus  inert vocal cords  So  the spectator  despite the movement which is unleashed with increased violence   a movement of manifest destruction   is seized with an invincible numbness  Only the hurricane surging from the abyss  and swelling the thousands of galleries  still raises the high structure  soon it drops and begins to melt  One observes ultimate palpitations  convulsions  blind and disorderly bursts  Attacked  eaten away  scoured  the giant is slowly engulfed and disappears  covered with whirlwinds of foam  And what does all this mean  Yes  what does that mean  I remembered an incident  which dated back to when I was Gibarians assistant  A group of school children were visiting the Solarist Institute in Aden  The teenagers  after crossing a side cabinet  had arrived in the main room of the library and were contemplating  to the left of the entrance  the boxes of microfilms which occupied half of the vast room  There  it was explained to them  were among other phenomena immortalized by the image  minute fragments of long vanished symetriads   not single shots  but whole reels  and there were more than eighty of them   ten thousand   A plump little girl  about fifteen years old  her nose wearing glasses  her eyes lively and resolute  suddenly asked   And whats the point   In the awkward silence that followed  the teacher merely cast a stern look at her unruly student  among the solarists in charge of guiding the schoolchildren  I was one of these guides   no one could answer  Because no two symmetriads are alike and the phenomena that take place within a symmetry are  in general  unpredictable  Sometimes no sound occurs  Sometimes the refractive index increases or decreases  Sometimes rhythmic pulsations cause a local change in gravitation  as if the symmetry had a gravitational beating heart  Sometimes the compasses of the observers begin to spin in circles  ionized layers arise and disappear  We could continue our enumeration indefinitely  Moreover  if one day we succeed in unlocking the secret of symmetriads  we will be left with asymmetries  The asymmetriads are born in the same way as the symmetriads  but their end is different and one can hardly distinguish in an asymmetry anything but tremors  vibrations and scintillations  We know  however  that inside an asymmetry dizzying processes take place  at a speed defying the laws of physics  and called  giant quantum phenomena   The mathematical analogy of such phenomena with certain three dimensional models of the atom is so unstable and fleeting that certain observers attribute to this similarity only a secondary interest  when they do not consider it purely accidental  Asymmetriads have a very short existence   fifteen to twenty minutes   and the end of an asymmetry is even more horrible than the end of a symmetry  With the tempestuous  howling breath that invades the asymmetry  a fluid rises  gurgles hideously and submerges everything under a bubbling of dirty foam  then an explosion  accompanied by a muddy eruption  throws up a column of debris  which falls for a long time in troubled rain on the agitated ocean  In a radius of several tens of kilometers around the focus of the explosion  it happens that one discovers this debris  carried by the wind  dried  yellow  flattened and similar to cartilaginous shards  Much rarer  difficult to observe and of very variable duration  certain creations stand out completely from the ocean  The first vestiges of these  independents  were identified   wrongly  it was later demonstrated   as the remains of creatures living in the depths of the ocean  The autonomous forms generally evoke birds with several wings  which flee from the moving trunks of the agilus  but the notions imported from Earth do not help to penetrate the mysteries of this planet  Sometimes  an exceptional appearance on the rocky shore of an island  strange seal like bodies can be seen  wallowing in the sun or slithering lazily towards the ocean  in which they become integrated  We did not get out of the notions conceived by man on Earth  As for a first contact  The explorers traveled hundreds of kilometers in the depths of the symetriads  setting up recording devices and automatic cameras  The artificial satellites captured by television the budding of the mimoids and the longus  faithfully communicating images of maturation and annihilation  The libraries were overflowing  the archives were constantly growing  and the price to be paid for all this documentation was often very expensive  Cataclysms engulfed a total of seven hundred and eighteen men  who had not left in time the colossi condemned to disappear  An infamous disaster cost the lives of one hundred and six people  including Giese himself  then aged seventy  the expedition studied a clearly characterized symmetriad  which was suddenly destroyed according to a process of extermination peculiar to asymmetriads  In two seconds  an eruption of sticky mire engulfed seventy nine men  their machines and their apparatus  twenty seven other observers  who were flying over the area in planes and helicopters  were also dragged into the abyss  The site of the disaster  at the intersection of the forty second parallel and the eighty ninth meridian  now bears the name Eruption des Cent Six  But only the maps keep the memory of this cataclysm  of which the ocean has kept no trace  Following the Eruption of the Hundred Six  and for the first time in the history of solarist studies  petitions demanded a thermonuclear attack directed against the ocean  This response would have been more cruel than revenge  since it was a question of destroying what we did not understand  Although it was never officially acknowledged  it is likely that Tsankens ultimatum influenced the negative outcome of the vote  Tsanken commanded Gieses reserve team   a transmission error had spared his life  he had wandered over the ocean and had arrived near the scene of the disaster a few minutes after the explosion  of which he still saw the black fungus  When he learned of the planned nuclear attack  he threatened to blow up the Station along with the nineteen survivors who had taken refuge there  Today  there are only three of us in the Station    Controlled by satellites  the construction of the Station was a technical operation of which men could be proud  but the ocean  in a few seconds  raises structures infinitely more considerable  The Station appears as a disc with a radius of one hundred meters  it has four floors in the center and two floors around the perimeter  it is maintained between five hundred and one thousand five hundred meters above the ocean by gravitors responsible for compensating the forces of attraction  In addition to all the devices available to ordinary Stations and large satelloids on other planets  the Solaris Station is equipped with special radars  sensitive to the first change in the surface of the ocean  which trigger an extra energy allowing the disc of steel to rise into the stratosphere as soon as the harbingers of new plasma construction appear  Yes  today  despite the presence of our faithful  visitors   the Station was singularly depopulated  Since the robots had been locked up on the lower floor  in the warehouses   for a reason that I still did not know   we had been circulating without meeting anyone  along the corridors of a ghost ship  abandoned by its crew and whose machines continued to run  When I put the ninth volume of Gieses monograph back on its shelf  it seemed to me that the steel floor  covered with plastic foam  had vibrated under my feet  I froze  but the vibration didnt repeat  The library being perfectly isolated from the other rooms  this vibration could have only one origin  a rocket had just left the Station  This thought brought me back to reality  I hadnt yet decided to go out  as Sartorius wanted  By pretending to fully approve of his plan  I was at most postponing the beginning of hostilities  since I was resolved to save Harey  But did Sartorius have any chance of succeeding  He had  in any case  enormous advantages over me   he was a physicist  he knew the problem much better than I did  I could count  paradoxically  only on the superiority of the ocean  For an hour I toiled over the study of microfilm  trying to penetrate neutrino physics through a mathematical language in which I recognized no familiar landmarks  At first the enterprise seemed hopeless to me  there were no less than five theories on neutrino fields  a clear sign that none of them was decisive  However  in the end  I managed to clear a plot of land that was quite promising  I was copying formulas when I heard knocking  I got up quickly and went to open the door ajar  Snaut lifted his sweaty face to me  Behind him  the corridor was deserted    Ah  its you       I pushed aside the panel    Between     Yes its me  He spoke in a hoarse voice  Bags hung under his bloodshot eyes  He wore a shiny rubber anti radiation apron and elastic suspenders supported the eternal filthy pants  His gaze swept around the circular  evenly lit room and settled on Harey  she was standing at the back  next to an armchair  Snaut looked back at me  I lowered my eyelids imperceptibly  He bowed and I said casually   Harey  this is Dr  Snaut     Snaut  this is my wife    Im  Im only a very discreet member of the team  I dont show myself often  thats why   His hesitation continued dangerously  but he managed to finish  Thats why I dont  didnt have the pleasure of meeting you sooner  Harey smiled and held out his hand  which he shook in some bewilderment  he blinked several times and stared at her without saying anything  I took him by the shoulder   Excuse me   he said to Harey  I wanted to talk to you  Kelvin  With superb ease  I replied   Of course  I am at your disposal   I was playing a sinister comedy  but what else   Harey  darling  dont bother  We have to discuss rather boring business matters    I took Snaut by the elbow and led him to the seats that were on the other side of the room  Harey sat down in the chair I had previously occupied  she had turned it so she could see us from above her book  I asked quietly   Whats up   He whispered between his teeth  Ive been divorced    If  a few days earlier  someone had told me of such a beginning of conversation  I would have laughed  but in the Station my sense of humor had faded   Since yesterday evening  I have lived hours which count for years   he added  Years that we do not forget  And you  After a moment  I replied    Nothing     I did not know what to say  I liked him  yet I was suspicious of him  or rather I was suspicious of the reason for his visit  He repeated   Nothing   You had to     I pretended not to understand    What  Eyes half closed  he leaned so close to me that I felt the warmth of his breath on my face  I cant reach Sartorius anymore  I only know what I wrote to you  what he told me after our little conference       He unplugged his phone    No  there was a short circuit in his house  He may have provoked it voluntarily  unless   He clenched his fist and made the gesture of smashing an object  An unpleasant smile tugged the corner of his lips  I looked at him without saying a word   Kelvin  I came to  what do you plan to do  I answered slowly    You come to seek my answer to your letter  Ill go for a walk  I have no reason to refuse  I was just preparing my trip     He interrupted me    No  its not about that  I simulated surprise    No  So what   I listen  He muttered   Sartorius  thinks hes on the way   Snaut kept his eyes on me  I did not move  I tried to maintain an indifferent air   First there was this X ray operation  which he organized with Gibarian  you remember  It may have resulted in some modification    What modification   They sent a beam of rays directly into the ocean  only modulating the intensity according to a program    I know  Niline had done it before  and many others   Yes  but the others had administered weak radiation  This time it was a powerful radiation  They sent all the energy they had at their disposal into the ocean    It can lead to unpleasant consequences     violation of the convention of the Four and the UN       Kelvin  you know very well that now it no longer matters  Gibarian is dead   Ah  Sartorius is going to shove it all on his back     I do not know  We havent talked about it  It does not matter  Sartorius is struck by the fact that  visitors  always arrive when one wakes up  He deduces from this that the ocean is mainly interested in our sleep and derives its production revenue from us while we sleep  Now Sartorius would like to send him our  wake state    our waking thoughts   you understand    By mail    Keep your jokes for your private use   A beam of rays will be modulated by the brain currents of one of us  I was beginning to see clearly    Ah  and one of us is me  Yes  Sartorius thought of you   You will thank him for me    So   I shut up  Snaut glanced at Harey  who was reading absorbedly  then looked at me again  I felt myself turning pale    So   he repeated  I shrugged my shoulders   The idea of transmitting these sermons on the greatness of man by X ray seems to me absolutely farcical   And you too  right    Truly     Yes  Very well  he said  smiling as if I had acceded to his wish  so youre against Sartorius project  I didnt know how it had happened  but from his expression I could see that he had led me by the nose   Very well   he continued  There is a second project  to build a Roche device   An annihilator     Yes  Sartorius has already undertaken the preliminary calculations  This is serious  And it doesnt even require a lot of energy  The device will produce magnetic anti fields twenty four hours a day  for an indefinite period of time   How do you imagine that     It is very simple  These are neutrino antifields  Ordinary matter will undergo no change  Only the  neutrino structures will be destroyed  You understand   Satisfied  he smiled  I remained motionless  my mouth ajar  He stopped smiling  With a furrowed brow  he looked at me attentively and waited a moment before speaking  As for the second project  Sartorius is actively involved in it  Lets call it the  Liberation  project  I closed my eyes for a moment  Suddenly I made up my mind  Snaut was not a physicist  Sartorius had disconnected or destroyed his telephone  Perfect   Then I said   Id rather call this second project Operation Slaughterhouse  Youve already practiced as a killer  Dont tell me otherwise  This time its something completely different  No more  visitors   no more F creations   no more  Disintegration instantly follows materialization  I nodded  with a smile that I hoped to make as natural as possible    There is a misunderstanding  Im not talking about moral scruples  but about self preservation  My dear Snaut  I dont want to die    What   He looked at me suspiciously  I pulled out of my pocket a sheet covered with formulas    I too  I considered this  experiment  Are you surprised  Yet it was I who put forward the neutrino hypothesis  wasnt it  Looked   Antifields can be created  Indeed  it is harmless to ordinary matter  But at the moment of destabilization  when the neutrino structure decays  we release the energy that holds the structure together   a huge surplus of energy is released  If we admit for a kilogram of substance at rest 108 ergs  we will obtain  for a creation F  57 multiplied by 108  Do you know what that means   the equivalent of a small charge of uranium exploding inside from the Station    What are you talking about   But  Sartorius surely considered all that  I smiled wickedly    Not necessarily  You see  Sartorius belongs to the school of Frazer and Cajolla  According to their theories  at the moment of disintegration  all the latent energy is released in the form of luminous radiation   a powerful light  perhaps not without danger  but without the power of destruction  However  there are other hypotheses  other theories concerning neutrino fields  According to Cayatte  according to Awalow  according to Sion  the scope of the show is considerably wider  at its maximum  the release of energy becomes a powerful emission of gamma rays  Sartorius trusts his masters and their theories  its very beautiful  but there are other masters and other theories  And do you know  Snaut   I continued  seeing that my words had impressed him   you also have to take this ocean into account  To achieve his creations  he surely followed an optimal method  In other words  the processes of the ocean seem to me an argument in favor of the other school  and against Sartorius   Give me that paper  Kelvin   I gave him the sheet  He tilted his head and tried to decipher my scribbles  With the tip of his finger  he pointed out something   What is it   I picked up the paper again    That  the magnetic field transmutation tensor    Give       Why  I knew what he was going to answer   I must show these calculations to Sartorius    As you wish       I took an indifferent tone   I can give you this sheet  of course  Only  you see  no one has yet verified these theories by experiment  we did not yet know of such structures  He trusts Frazer  and I followed Sions theory  Sartorius will tell you that I am not a physicist  neither is Sion  Or  at least  not from his point of view  He will discuss  I dont want a discussion  which would lead me to retract  for the greater glory of Sartorius  You  I can convince you  Im not strong enough to convince Sartorius and I wont try   So what do you want to do   He got to work  Snaut spoke in a toneless voice  He had stooped  all his animation had died down  I didnt know if he trusted me  to tell the truth  I didnt care  I replied quietly   What do I want to do   What a man does when you try to kill him   Ill try to communicate with him   Maybe hes got some precautions  Snaut growled  then looked up  Listen  what if  and the first project  Would you accept  Sartorius would agree  Surely  Its  in any case  its a chance to be taken    You believe it    No   he replied immediately  But what are we risking  I didnt want to accept too quickly  I wanted to save time and Snaut could help me extend the time   Ill think it over   Okay  Im leaving   Snaut growled    When he stood up  all his bones cracked   Well have to start with an encephalogram   he said  rubbing his apron  as if trying to erase an invisible stain    Good  Without taking leave of Harey  he walked towards the door  The book resting in his lap  Harey watched him exit  When the door closed  I got up  I smoothed out the sheet of paper I was holding  The formulas were correct  I had not falsified them  But would Zion have approved of my developments  Probably not  I started  Harey came over and touched my shoulder    Chris   What  darling     Who was it    Doctor Snaut  I told you   What kind of man     I do not know him well     why    He looked at me in such a weird way       He liked you  She shook her head    No  he was looking at me differently  as  as if  She shivered  looked up at me and immediately lowered them    Lets get out of here
