i was lying on my back  hareys head in the crook of my shoulder  i thought of nothing  the darkness was peopled  i heard footsteps  something was piling up above me  higher and higher  ad infinitum  the night  the night pierced me through and through  the night took possession of me  it enveloped me and penetrated me  impalpable  inconsistent  petrified  i couldnt breathe  there was no air to breathe  far away  i could hear my heart beating  i gathered the rest of my strength  all my attention  and waited for the agony  i was waiting  i was shrinking  and the invisible sky  without horizon  shapeless space  without clouds  without stars  receded  extended and grew around me  i tried to crawl onto my bed  but there was no bed  the darkness no longer covered anything  i pressed my hands against my face  i had no more fingers  no more hands  i wanted to scream  howl  the room floated in a blue half light  which surrounded the furniture  the shelves loaded with books  which erased the color of the walls and of any object  a pearly whiteness irradiated the window  i was drenched in sweat  i glanced sideways  harey looked at me  she raised her head  do you have a numb arm  the color of his eyes had also been erased  they were gray   luminous  though  under the black eyelashes    what     i felt his whisper like a caress  before understanding the meaning of the words    no  oh yes   i say finally  i put my hand on his shoulder  i had tingling in my fingers  she asked   did you have a bad dream   i drew him with the other hand    a dream  yes  i was dreaming  and you  havent you slept    i do not know  i do not believe  im not sleepy  it must not prevent you from sleeping  why are you looking at me like that  i closed my eyes  his heart was beating against my heart  his heart   just an accessory  i tell myself  but nothing surprised me anymore  not even my own indifference  i had crossed the boundaries of fear and despair  i had come so far   no one had ever come so far  my lips brushed her neck  i descended lower  to the cavity between the tendons  the blood pounded the shell wall of silken flesh  i leaned on my elbow  dawn  sweetness of dawn  a silent storm set the cloudless horizon ablaze  a flash  the first ray of the blue sun  crossed the room and broke into sharp reflections  there was a crossfire of sparks  spurting from the mirror  the doorknobs  the nickel plated pipes  the light scattered  threw itself on any smooth surface and seemed to want to conquer a larger space  to burst the room  i looked at harey  the pupil of his gray eyes had contracted  she asked in a dull voice   is the night already over    here  the night never lasts long    and u s     what us   well stay here long   coming from him  the question was not lacking in comic flavor  but  when i spoke  my voice revealed no trace of gaiety  long enough  probably  dont you want to stay  she didnt blink  she looked at me carefully  had she blinked now  i wasnt sure  she pulled back the blanket and i saw the little pink triangle on her arm   why are you looking at me like that     because you are very pretty  she smiles  without malice  she thanked me discreetly for my compliment    truly   it seems like its like    what   like you doubted something    what an idea     as if you were suspicious of me  as if i had hidden something       absurd    in your way of denying  i can see that im not mistaken  the light became blinding  hand in visor  i looked for my glasses  they were on the table  i knelt down  stretched out my arm and put on the black glasses  when i lay down next to her  harey smiled   and me   i suddenly understood    glasses  i got up and started poking around  i opened drawers  i moved books  instruments  i found two pairs of glasses  which i gave to harey  she tried them on  one pair after another  the glasses were too big  they fell to the middle of his nose  creaking  the shutters slid in front of the window  and it was night again  groping  i helped harey remove his glasses and put our glasses under the bed  she asked   what are we doing     at night  we sleep   kris      what    do you want a compress on your forehead     no thanks  thank you darling  i dont know why i added those two words  in the darkness  i grasped her graceful shoulders  felt them quiver  and felt sure i was holding harey in my arms  or rather  i suddenly realized that she wasnt trying to trick me  it was me who was cheating on her   because she honestly thought she was harey  i then dozed off several times  and each time an anguished start roused me from sleep  panting  exhausted  i pressed myself against her  my heart was slowly calming down  with her fingertips  she cautiously touched my cheeks  my forehead  to check if i had a fever  it was harey  the one  real harey  something changed in me  i stopped struggling and almost immediately fell asleep  a feeling of pleasant freshness woke me up  i had my face covered with a damp cloth  which i removed easily  i saw harey leaning over me  she smiles at me  with both hands she squeezed a piece of gauze  which dripped into a porcelain basin  next to the basin was a bottle of healing lotion   what sleep   she said  applying to my temple the compress she had just prepared    you are hurt     no  i frowned  the skin had regained its suppleness  harey was sitting on the edge of the bed  her dark hair tossed over the collar of a bathrobe  a mans bathrobe  striped orange and white  the sleeves of which she had rolled up to the elbow  i was terribly hungry  twenty hours  at least  had passed since my last meal  when harey had finished nursing  i got up  my gaze fell on two dresses  which draped the back of an armchair   two absolutely identical white dresses  each adorned with a row of red buttons  i had torn one of those dresses myself  to help harey out of it  and harey came back last night wearing the second dress  she followed my gaze  i had to undo the seam with scissors  she said  i think the zipper got stuck  the sight of these two identical dresses exceeded in horror anything i had known before  harey was busy putting the little pharmacy in order  i turned away and bit my fist  continuing to stare at these two dresses   or rather this one and only split dress   i walked towards the door  water flowed noisily from the faucet  i opened the door  slipped out of the room  and carefully closed the panel  i heard the murmur of water  the clink of bottles  suddenly all noise ceased  jaws clenched  i waited  the panel of the door reflected one of the luminous tubes which surrounded the ceiling of the rotunda  i held the doorknob  unconvinced that i could keep it up  a sudden jolt nearly snatched it from my hand  but the door did not open  it vibrated and began to shake up and down  stunned  i let go of the handle and stepped back  the plastic panel was hollowing out  as if an invisible figure next to me had tried to break down the door to enter the room  the panels steel frame was bowing more and more and the enamel coating was crumbling  suddenly it dawned on me  instead of pushing the door  which opened outward  harey was trying to pull it open  the reflection of the luminous tube curved in the distorting mirror of the white panel  a powerful crack sounded and the panel  stretched to the extreme  split  simultaneously  the hilt disappeared  torn from its mount  bloody hands slipped through the crack  moved forward  leaving red marks on the milky varnish  and the door shattered into two pieces hanging at an angle from their hinges  a livid face appeared  a haggard creature  dressed in an orange and white bathrobe  rushed to my chest  sobbing  i wanted to flee  too late and against all hope  but i was unable to move  harey was breathing heavily  his disheveled head hammered my shoulder  when i could reach out to control her  harey collapsed  avoiding the shattered panel  i carried her inside the bedroom and laid her on the bed  on the tips of his scratched fingers  the nails were broken  when she turned her hand over  i saw the bones of her palm protrude bare  i looked at his face  the eyes  devoid of expression  did not see me   harey   she responded with an inarticulate grunt  i put a finger to his eye  the eyelid closed  i headed for the pharmacy  the bed creaked  i turned around  harey sat staring in horror at her bloody hands   kris   she moaned   i i what happened to me  i replied curtly   you hurt yourself tearing down the door   my lips itched weirdly  especially my lower lip  which i pinned between my teeth  harey stared at the dangling pieces of the plastic panel clinging to the steel frame for a moment  then looked back at me  she was trying to hide the terror that had invaded her  but i saw that her chin was trembling  i cut squares of gauze  took a jar of antiseptic powder and went back to the bed  the glass jar slipped from my hands and broke  but i no longer needed it  i lifted hareys hand  the fingernails  still surrounded by a trickle of clotted blood  had grown back  a pink scar marked the hollow of the palm  and this scar was shrinking  fading visibly  i sat up  stroked his face  and tried to smile   without much success   why did you do that  harey     its me   her eyes pointed to the door    yes     you do not remember    no     that is to say  i realized that you were no longer there  i was very scared  and       and what    i looked for you  i thought you might be in the bathroom     only then did i notice that the sliding wardrobe  hiding the entrance to the bathroom  had been pushed back    next     i ran for the door    after     i forgot     something must have happened       what    i do not know   what do you remember later    i was sitting here on the bed   dont you remember i carried you here   the corner of her lips sagging  her face worried  she hesitated    it seems to me  its possible  i dont know  she swung her legs over the edge of the bed  got up and walked towards the broken door    chris  approaching behind her  i seized her by the shoulders  she was shaking  she suddenly turned around and whispered   kris  kris    calm down   kris  if thats me kris  do i have epilepsy   epilepsy   good god  she definitely had fun questions    what an idea  my dear  the doors  you see  the doors here  they are strange doors  we left the room at the moment when the shutter of the window creaked up  the blue sun was sinking into the ocean  i led harey to the small kitchen on the other side of the rotunda  together we looted cupboards and refrigerators  i soon realized that harey wasnt much better at cooking or opening tins than i was  i devoured the contents of two cans and drank countless cups of coffee  harey also ate  as children sometimes eat  when they are not hungry and do not want to annoy their parents  or rather no  because she didnt force herself to eat  she absorbed the food automatically  with indifference  after the meal  we went into the operating room  adjoining the radio booth  i had my plan  i told harey i wanted to have a medical check up a simple check up on his general condition and put him in a mechanical chair  i took a syringe and needles out of the sterilizer  i knew the place of each object  the instructors had neglected no detail  during the training course  inside the model of the station  harey held out his fingers to me  i took a drop of blood  i smeared the blood on a glass plate  which i placed at the bottom of the exhauster  then i introduced the wafer into a vacuum tank and i rained down a shower of silver ions  i felt better  the gestures of familiar work had a calming effect  lying on the cushions of the mechanical chair  harey gazed at the equipment in the operating room  the hum of the telephone fills the silence  i picked up the receiver   kelvin  i was watching harey  she had remained impassive  she seemed exhausted from her recent adventure  i heard a sigh of relief    finally  it was snaut  i waited  the receiver pressed to my ear   you have a visit  dont you     yes    you are busy     yes    a little auscultation  huh    are you disturbed   you wanted to play a game of chess   dont get upset  kelvin  sartorius wants to meet you  he would like the three of us to meet  surprised  i replied    very kind of him  but    i interrupted myself  then i continued  is he alone    no  i misspoke  he would like to speak with us  the three video telephones will be connected to the same line  the image transmission lenses will be blocked    ah  why didnt he call me himself  am i intimidating her   possibly   growled snaut  so     a conference     in an hour  it will    very well  i saw him on the screen   only the face  no bigger than the fist  for a moment he looked at me attentively  i heard the crackle of electric current  then sna ut spoke  with some hesitation   are you managing     not too bad  and you    a little worse than you  i guess     could i       would you like to come to my house  over my shoulder  i looked at harey  she was stretched out  her legs crossed  her head tilted forward  with a gloomy face  she played mechanically with the little chrome ball that terminated a chain fixed to the armrest of the armchair  snauts voice rang out   leave that  do you hear   i tell you to leave it  i saw his profile on the screen  i couldnt hear anything   he had covered the microphone with his hand   but his lips were moving   no  i cant come   he said quickly  may be later  anyway  ill call you in an hour  the screen went blank  i hung up the handset    who was it   harey asked  not showing any curiosity   snaut  a cybernetician  you dont know him   will it last long     youre bored   i put the first plate of the series in the case of the neutrinic microscope and  one after the other  i pressed the switches of different colors  magnetic fields rumbled dully   there arent many distractions here  and if my modest company isnt enough for you   i spoke absently  lengthening the intervals between words  i drew the big black helmet which flared around the telescope of the microscope towards me and i rested my forehead on the elastic foam of the visor  i heard hareys voice  but i didnt understand what she was saying  my gaze overlooked  in an abrupt foreshortening  an enormous desert flooded with silvery light  dotted with rounded rocky plates   red blood cells   quivering and swaying behind a veil of mist  i focused the telescope and penetrated deeper into the fiery landscape  without taking my eyes off the visor  i turned the orientation crank  when a shard of rock  an isolated globule  found itself at the crossroads of the black threads  i enlarged the image  the lens had apparently encountered a deformed erythrocyte  collapsed in the middle  its jagged edges casting sharp black shadows into the depths of a circular crater  the crater  bristling with deposits of silver ions  slipped out of the microscopes field of view  the nebulous outlines of albumen links  atrophied and distorted  appeared within an opalescent liquid  a serpentine of albumen folded up at the crossroads of the black threads of the lens  slowly  gradually  i operated the enlargement lever  from one moment to another  i was to arrive at the end of this exploration of the abysses  the shadow of a molecule occupied the entire space  then the image became blurry  nothing however was shown  i should have seen the hectic cloud of atoms vibrating   i saw nothing  the screen blazed  immaculate  i pushed the lever all the way  the irritated snoring grew louder  i still couldnt see anything  an alarm signal sounded  repeated itself  the circuit was overloaded  one last time  i gazed out over the silvery wasteland and turned off the power  i looked at harey  she gave a hint of a yawn  which she deftly changed into a smile  she asked   am i in good health     excellent  youre doing very well    couldnt be better  i continued to stare at her and again felt a bug running through my bottom lip  what exactly had happened  what did that mean  this body  weak and fragile in appearance   indestructible in reality   did it finally turn out to be composed of nothing  i banged my fist on the cylinder of the microscope  a fault in the device  wrong concentration of magnetic fields  no  i knew the device worked perfectly  i had gone through all the levels   the cells  the albumin conglomerates  the molecules   and everything was similar to what i had already observed on thousands of preparations  but the last step into matter had taken me nowhere  i tied harvey  i took the blood from a middle vein and poured it into a graduated glass container  i then distribute it among several test tubes  i started the analyses  this work required more time than i had anticipated  i lacked a bit of practice  reactions were normal  all reactions    i dropped a drop of frozen acid onto a coral bead  smoke  the blood turned gray and covered with a layer of dirty foam  disintegration  decomposition  further  further  i turned away to pick up a second test tube  when my eye returned to the experiment in progress  i nearly dropped the thin glass tube  beneath the layer of dirty foam  a dark coral grew  the blood  destroyed by the acid  recreated itself  it was absurd  impossible    chris   i heard my name from a great distance    kris  the phone    what   oh yes thank you  the telephone had been ringing for a long time  i realized it only then  i picked up the receiver   kelvin    snaut  we are all three connected to the same line  sartorius high pitched voice echoed through the earpiece   hail  dr  kelvin    the cautious voice  falsely assured  of the lecturer who has ventured onto a crumbling stage  i replied   my respects  dr  sartorius   i wanted to laugh  but i didnt know if i could allow myself to give in to a gaiety whose causes remained unclear  in the end  who was to be laughed at  i held in my hand a test tube containing blood  i shook her  the blood had coagulated  perhaps  a few moments earlier  i had been the victim of an illusion  maybe i was wrong    i wanted to expose to you  dear colleagues  certain questions concerning the  the ghosts  i heard sartorius and yet my mind refused to accept his words  contemplating the coagulated blood at the bottom of the test tube  i defended myself against this voice which tried to force my attention   lets call them f creations   snaut slipped quickly   ah  yes  very well  a vertical line  barely perceptible in the middle of the screen  indicated that i was connected to two channels  separated by this line  i should have seen two images   snaut and sartorius  but the screen  framed by a luminous border  remained dark  both of my interlocutors had covered the lens of their camera    each of us has carried out various experiments    always the same caution in the nasal voice  a silence   i suggest first an exchange of acquired knowledge   continued sartorius  i will venture  then  to communicate the conclusions to which i reached personally  if you would like to start  dr  kelvin    me  i suddenly felt that harey was looking at me  i put my hand on the table and rolled the test tube under the racks loaded with utensils  then i perched on top of a high stool  which i had attracted with my foot  i was about to recuse myself  when  to my own astonishment  i heard myself reply   good   a little chat  i havent done much  but i can talk about it  a histological preparation and some reactions  microreactions  i feel like    i didnt know what to say  suddenly  a valve opened and i resumed  everything is normal  but its a camouflage  a mask  in a certain sense  it is a supercopy  a superior reproduction of the original  let me explain  whereas there exists  in man  a fundamental limit   an end to structural divisibility    the frontiers here are pushed back  we are dealing with an infra atomic framework    one moment  one moment  could you clarify your thought  asked sartorius  snaut said nothing  was it the echo of his hurried breathing that i heard  harey looked at me again  i realized that  in my excitement  i had almost shouted the last words  calmed  i sank back into my uncomfortable perch and closed my eyes  how to clarify my thought    the atom is the ultimate building block of our body  i assume that the f creations are made up of smaller units than ordinary atoms  much smaller   mesons   sartorius hinted  he was in no way surprised    no  not mesons  i would have seen them  the power of my device down here is one tenth to one twentieth of an angstrom  isnt it  but we see nothing  nothing at all  they are therefore not mesons  rather neutrinos   how do you base this assumption   neutrino conglomerates arent stable    i dont know  i am not a physicist  maybe a magnetic field can stabilize them  i dont know the question  in any case  if my observations are correct  the building is made up of particles ten thousand times smaller than atoms  wait  im not done  if albumin molecules and cells were made directly from these  micro atoms   they would have to be proportionally smaller  globules too  and ferments  everything  but the dimensions are those of the structures of atoms  consequently  albumin  cell  cell nucleus  everything is only a mask  the real structure  which controls the functioning of the  visitor   remains concealed more deeply    kelvin  snaut had just stifled a cry  i broke off  terrified  i had said  visitor   harey hadnt heard me  besides  she wouldnt have understood  her head resting in the palm of her hand  she gazed out the window  and the purple dawn surrounded her delicate profile  my distant interlocutors were silent  i heard them breathing   theres something to remember about that   snaut muttered  yes  remarked sartorius  but one thing stops us  the hypothetical kelvin particles do not constitute the structure of the ocean  the ocean is a structure of atoms  i answered    it may be capable of producing neutrinos  i suddenly lost interest in their remarks  the conversation was pointless   and not even funny   kelvins hypothesis would explain this extraordinary resistance and the speed of regeneration   growled snaut  moreover  they probably carry within them an energy source  they dont need to eat  i ask to speak  interrupted sartorius    the horrifying chairman of the debate held firm to the role he had assigned to himself    i would like to raise the question of the motivation for the appearance of the f creations  i would introduce the question in the following way  what are the f creations  they are not autonomous individuals  nor copies of determined individuals  they are only materialized projections of the contents of our brain  on the theme of a given individual  the correctness of this definition struck me  sartorius wasnt nice  but he wasnt stupid either  i resumed the conversation    i think youre right  your definition would explain why this per creation appeared  rather than another  materialization originates in the most durable imprints of memory  particularly differentiated imprints  no footprint  however  can be completely isolated  during  breeding   fragments of contiguous prints were absorbed  consequently  the newcomer sometimes reveals more extensive knowledge than that of the authentic individual of whom he is the copy    kelvin  snaut shouted again  only snaut reacted to my vocabulary deviations  sartorius didnt seem to mind  did this mean that sartorius  visitor  was less perceptive by nature than snauts  visitor   for a second i imagined the learned dr  sartorius flanked by a stunted moron   indeed  that corresponds to our observations   said sartorius  now consider the motivation for the apparition  it is quite natural to suppose  in the first place  that we are the object of an experiment  if i examine this thesis  the experimentation seems to me poorly conducted  when we perform an experiment  we take advantage of the results obtained and  above all  we carefully record the failures of our experimentation system  as a result  we are subsequently introducing changes to our way of doing business  however  in the case which concerns us  no modification intervenes  the f creations reappear identical to what they were  without the slightest correction    as disarmed as before  each time we try to    to get rid of them    i decided   okay  return fire without corrective device  like dr  snaut would say  findings  simply that the experimentation thesis doesnt sit well with this  this incredible screw up  the ocean is precise  the double level structure of the f creations testifies to this precision  within certain limits  the f creations behave in the same way as the real  the  he couldnt manage to extricate himself   the originals   snaut breathed briskly    yes  the originals  but  when the situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of  uh  of the original  the creation f undergoes a kind of  disconnection of consciousness   immediately followed by different  inhuman manifestations   true  say   i  and we can have fun compiling a catalog of the behavior of  of these creations   perfectly sterile occupation   im not sure   protested sartorius    i suddenly understood why he irritated me so much  he didnt speak  he discoursed  as if he had sat at a meeting of the institute  apparently  he couldnt express himself otherwise   here comes a question of individuality   he continued   of which the ocean has no idea  im sure  i believe that the  uh  delicate  shocking aspect of our present condition is completely beyond his comprehension   do you think his actions werent premeditated   sartorius point of view stunned me somewhat  on reflection  i recognized that it was difficult to exclude him    no  unlike our colleague snaut  i dont believe in any perfidy  in any malice  in any cruel intention  snaut raised his voice    i dont lend him human feelings  but i try to explain to myself these continual returns   with a secret desire to annoy sartorius  i say  perhaps  they  are plugged into a device that spins in circles and repeats itself  like a record    please  dear colleagues  lets not scatter  i have not finished  under normal circumstances  i would have thought it premature to present even a provisional report on the progress of my work  given the particular situation  i think i can afford to speak  i have the impression   a feeling  i must add   that dr  kelvins hypothesis is not without accuracy  i am referring to the hypothesis of a neutrino structure  our knowledge in this field is purely theoretical  we did not know that there was a possibility of stabilizing such structures  a clearly defined outcome is now before us  the means of neutralizing the magnetic field ensuring the stability of the structure  for a few moments  i had noticed light rays on the screen  a wide slit illuminated  from top to bottom  the left half of the receiver  and i saw a pink object which moved slowly  the shutter slipped again and flew away  sartorius uttered a heart rending cry   go away   go away   i saw sartoriuss hands and forearms writhing  struggling  protected by ample laboratory sleeves  a golden disk suddenly shone  then everything went out  only then did i realize that this yellow disk was a straw hat  i took a deep breath    snaut  a tired voice answered me    yes  kelvin       hearing him  i understood that i liked him  and that i preferred not to know who was keeping him company    thats enough for now  right  he said    i think so too    before he had hung up  i added hastily  listen  if you can  come and see me  in the operating room or in my cabin  will you   okay  but i dont know when  here ended the conference
