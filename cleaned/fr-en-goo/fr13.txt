three weeks passed  the window shutters were lowered and raised at fixed times  at night  i was a prisoner of my nightmares  and  each morning  the comedy began again  but was it a comedy  i was composing myself a peaceful appearance  and harey was playing the same game  we deceived each other  knowingly  and this agreement served our ultimate escape  we discussed the future  our life on earth  our installation in the vicinity of a big city  we would no longer leave the earth  we would spend the rest of our existence under the blue sky and among the green trees  together  we imagined the layout of our house  the layout of the garden  we were arguing over details  the location of a hedge or a bench  was i sincere for a single moment  no  i knew our plans were impossible  i knew it  for even if harey had been able to leave the station and survive the trip  how would i have got through the security checkpoints with my stowaway  earth only welcomes humans  and every human being must have proper papers  at the first check  harey would be detained  to try to establish his identity  we would be separated and harey would immediately betray himself  the station was the only place where we could live together  did harey know  surely  did someone tell him  yeah  probably  one night i heard harey slowly getting up  i wanted to hold her back   in the dark and the silence  we still sometimes freed ourselves for a moment from despair  from escaping the torture of oblivion  harey hadnt noticed that i had woken up  when i stretched out my arm  she was already standing  barefoot  she walked towards the door  i felt a confused anguish  not daring to raise my voice  i whispered   harey   i sat down on the bed  harey had gone out  leaving the door ajar  a thin wall of light cut obliquely into the room  i thought i heard whispers  harey was talking with someone  who  i jumped out of bed  but mad terror gripped me  and my legs refused to move  i listened  i no longer heard any noise  i let myself fall back onto the sheet  blood pounded my temples  i started counting  i was coming to a thousand  when the door panel parted  harey entered  closed the door silently  and stood motionless for a moment  i tried to breathe regularly  she called quietly   kris  i didnt answer  she quickly slipped into bed and lay down next to me  careful not to touch me  i did not move  in my head  i formed questions  but i refused to speak first  how long did i stay like that  asking silent questions  an hour maybe  then i fell asleep  the morning was like so many other mornings  i watched harey furtively  i saw no change in his behavior  after lunch  we sat facing the large panoramic window  the station sailed among purple clouds  harey was reading a book  staring straight ahead  i suddenly realized that by tilting my head at a certain angle i saw our double reflection in the glass  i removed my hand from the grab bar  harey had no idea i was watching her in the window  she glanced at me and  from my attitude  evidently judged that i was gazing at the ocean  so she leaned quickly over to the grab bar and kissed the spot my hand had just touched  the next moment she was reading her book again   harey   i asked quietly   where did you go last night     tonight     yes   you you were dreaming  kris  i havent been anywhere   didnt you go out     no     you must have dreamed    maybe     yes  i may have dreamed     in the evening  i began to talk about our trip  the return to earth  harey interrupted me   dont talk to me about that trip again  kris   i dont want to hear about it anymore  you know    what    no nothing  when we were in bed  she told me she was thirsty   theres a glass of syrup over there on the table  would you give it to me  please   she drank half the glass  then handed it to me  i was not thirsty  she smiles    drink to my health  i drank the syrup  which seemed a little salty  but my mind was elsewhere    harey       she had just turned off the lamp   harey  since you dont want to talk about our trip anymore  lets talk about something else   if i didnt exist  would you get married     no    never     never    why     i do not know  i was single for ten years  and i never remarried  lets not talk about that  darling  my head was spinning  like id had too much wine    no  lets talk about it  what if i asked you to do it   to get married   what an absurd idea  harey  i dont need anyone but you  she leaned over me  his breath brushed my lips  she hugged me with all her might  say it differently    i like you  his head fell on my arm  i felt tears   harey  whats wrong with you     nothing     nothing     nothing      she repeated more and more quietly  my eyes were closing  the red dawn woke me up  my head was heavy and my neck stiff  as if the vertebrae had fused together  the pasty tongue  i swallowed a bitter saliva  what could i have poisoned myself with  i stretched out my arm towards harey  my hand felt a cold sheet  i jumped up  i was alone   alone in the bed  alone in the cabin  the curved glass reflected a row of red suns  i jumped to the ground  staggering like a drunken man  clinging to the furniture  i reached the sliding wardrobe  the bathroom was empty  the rotunda was empty  there was no one in the workshop   harey   waving my arms  i ran around and called out to him  one last time i yelled   harey  and my voice choked  i already knew the truth  i dont remember exactly what happened next  half naked  i ran from one end of the station to the other  i seem to remember even going into the central refrigeration plant  exploring the warehouse stores  i knocked with closed fists against the locked doors  i moved away  then i came back to bump into the doors that had already resisted me  i tumbled down the stairs  i fell  i got up  i rushed i dont know where  forward    a glass wall slid open  i had arrived at the double armored door which opened onto the ocean  i attacked the door  i was shouting   i still hoped that i was dreaming  for a while  someone had been beside me  someone was clinging to me  dragging me away  i found myself stretched out on a metal table in the small workshop  i was panting  a vapor of alcohol burned my nostrils and throat  my shirt was soaked in icy water  my hair stuck to my skull  snaut was busy in front of a medicine cabinet  he moved instruments and glass utensils  which clashed with an intolerable din  suddenly  i saw him above me  he looked me seriously in the eyes    where is she    shes not here   but  harey   he hunched over  brought his face closer  and said slowly  very distinctly   harey is dead  i closed my eyes and whispered  shell be back  i wasnt afraid of her coming back  i wanted it  i couldnt explain to myself why i had myself  one day  tried to chase her away  why i had then been so afraid of seeing her return  he handed me a glass    here  drink this  i threw the entire contents of the glass in his face  he stepped back  wiping his eyes  when he opened his eyelids  i was standing  towering above him  he was so small    its you    what are you talking about     no fuss  you know what im talking about  it was you she met the other night  and you told her to give me a sleeping pill  what happened to her  i listen   he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out an envelope  i snatched it from his hands  it was stuck on and bore no inscription  i tore open the envelope  it contained a sheet folded in four  i recognized the handwriting  a large irregular handwriting  a bit childish   my darling  i asked him  it is good  im sorry i had to lie to you  please grant me this one favor  listen to him  and above all dont hurt yourself  you have been wonderful  there was one last word  crossed out but i could decipher  she had signed  harey   i read and reread the letter  i had become fully lucid again  i wasnt going to scream hysterically  besides  i no longer had a voice  no longer even the strength to moan  i finally whispered    how     how   later  kelvin  calm down     im calm  speak   how     by annihilation    but     and the device    roches device was not suitable  sartorius has built another  a new destabilizer  a miniature device  with a range of a few meters   and she    she disappeared  a flash and a breath of air  a little breath of air  thats all    a short range device    yes  we didnt have the materials to build a large device  the walls tilted towards me  i closed my eyes   but  she  she will be back    no    what do you know about that    no  kelvin  shes not coming back  do you remember those wings of foam  going up  since that day  they havent come back    no     no  i say quietly    you killed her       yes     in my place  you would have acted differently  i turned my back to him and started to walk across the room  nine quick steps from the corner to the opposite wall  return  nine steps again  ever faster  i stopped in front of snaut  look  were going to write a report  we will request immediate liaison with the council  its doable  they will accept  they must accept  the planet will no longer be subject to the rules of the convention of the four  all means will be allowed  well bring in antimatter generators  do you believe there is any body that can resist antimatter  there are none  nothing resists antimatter  nothing  nothing  nothing    i was screaming and the tears were blinding me   do you want to destroy it   why     go away  leave me   no  im not going out   snaut    i was staring at him  he shook his head    what do you want   what do you require of me  he backed up to the table  fine  well write a report  i started walking again    sit down   he ordered    leave me alone     there are two separate questions  first  the facts  second  our wishes   and now is the time to talk about it     yes now   i dont want to hear anything  you understood   your distinctions dont interest me   we sent our last statement about two months ago  before gibarian died  we should establish exactly the process of appearance     i grabbed his arm    youre going to shut up  yes    hit me if you want  i will not be silent  i let go of him  oh  talk as much as you please  well  listen   sartorius will try to conceal certain facts  im almost sure of it   and you  wont you hide anything     no  not anymore  the case goes beyond personal responsibilities  you know that as well as i do   he  showed thoughtful activity  he is able to operate an organic synthesis at the highest level  a synthesis that we ourselves have never achieved  he knows the structure  the microstructure  the metabolism of our body       indeed     why do you stop talking  he performed on us a series  a series of experiments  psychic vivisection  he used knowledge  which he stole from us  without taking into account our aspirations  these are no longer facts  kelvin  nor even propositions  these are assumptions  in a way  he took into account the desires locked away in a secret corner of our mind  he may have sent us gifts    gifts   good lord   an irrepressible laugh shook me  i howled with laughter  snaut grabs my hand    calm down  i squeezed his fingers  i heard the bones crack  impassive  his eyelids wrinkled  he braved my gaze  i moved away and took refuge in a corner of the studio  face turned to the wall  i say    ill try to dominate me    yes  of course     i understand  what do we ask of them    you decide     i can not concentrate now     she said something before    no nothing  if you want my opinion  now we have a chance    a chance   what luck   a chance to  ah    again  i looked him in the face  and suddenly i understood    the contact   contact again  so youre not over the head of this madhouse  what more do you need  the contact  no  no  no  dont count on me    why not   he said calmly  you  instinctively  and right now more than ever  are treating him like a human being  you hate him    and you not   no  kelvin  no  hes blind   i repeated   blind  i wasnt sure i heard correctly    or rather  he  sees  differently than we do  we do not exist for him in the same way that we exist for each other  we recognize each other by the appearance of the face  the body  for him  this appearance is a translucent window  it enters directly inside the brain    well  so what  what is your point   if he succeeded in recreating a human being who exists only in my memory  and in such a way that his eyes  his gestures  his voice  his voice    go on  speak     i speak     i speak     the voice     the voice     because he can read us like a book     do you understand what i mean   yes  that he could get along with us     this is not obvious     no  its not at all obvious  he may have used a crafting recipe expressed in more than words  as a record etched in memory  this recipe takes the form of a protein structure  comparable to a zoosperm or an egg  in the brain  there are no words  no feelings  human memory is a repertoire written in terms of nucleic acids on asynchronous large molecule crystals   he  picked up the deepest  most isolated  most  assimilated  imprint  without necessarily knowing what it means for us  lets assume that i am able to reproduce the architecture of a symmetry  that i know the materials it is made of  and that i have the technological means to operate efficiently    i create a symmetry and i throw it into the ocean   but i do not know why i do this  i do not know what it is for  i do not know what it means to him       yes  i said  you may be right  in that case  he didnt mean us any harm  he wasnt trying to destroy us  yes  its possible  and without any intention  my lips started to quiver    kelvin    yes  yes  do not worry  you are good  and the ocean is good  everyone is good  but why   explain to me  why  why did he do this  what did you say to her  to her    the truth   the truth  the truth      what     you know it     come to my place  we will write the report  come     hold on   what exactly do you want  but you dont intend to stay in the station    yes  i want to stay
