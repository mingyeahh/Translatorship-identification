the next day  after lunch  i found a note from snaut on my table  sartorius had postponed the construction of the annihilator and was about to shoot a powerful beam of beams into the ocean one last time   harey  honey  i have to go see snaut  the red dawn set the window ablaze and divided the room into two parts  we were standing in a region of blue shadow  beyond this gray area  everything was copper  if a book had fallen from its shelf  my ear would have instinctively listened for a metallic ringing   its about this experience  only  i dont know how to do it  you see  i would rather  i interrupted myself   kris  you dont have to justify yourself   i would so  if it didnt last too long   it will take some time  look  do you think you could wait in the hallway    i will try  what if i cant control myself    what exactly do you feel    i added  hastily  im not questioning you out of indiscretion  dont get me wrong  but if we dig into the question a little  you might find a way to dominate yourself   im scared   she said   she had turned pale   i cant even explain to you what im afraid of  because in reality im not afraid of anything or anyone  i i feel lost  and im terribly ashamed of myself  then when you come back  its over  thats why i thought it was a disease  she spoke in a low voice and she was shaking   perhaps its only in this cursed station that you experience terrors   ill arrange for us to leave quickly  she widened her eyes    do you think its possible    why not   i am not a prisoner here  ill have to talk to snaut  what do you think  how long can you be alone    it depends       she lowered her head  if i hear your voice  i think i will manage not to move   id rather you didnt hear us  i have nothing to hide from you  but i dont know  i cant know  what snaut will say    do not continue  i understand  i will stay at a good distance  it will be enough that i recognize the sound of your voice    ill call him from the studio  i dont close the doors  harey nodded  i crossed the red zone  by contrast  and despite the lamps  the corridor seemed dark to me  the door to the studio was open  last traces left by the events of the night  the debris of the deware bottle shone under a row of liquid oxygen tanks  when i lifted the handset  the small screen lit up  i dialed the number of the radio booth  behind the matte glass  the film of bluish light burst  leaning sideways over the arm of a chair  snaut looked me in the eye   hi   he said    i found your ticket  i would like to talk to you  i can come     you can  right away     yes    excuse me  are you coming alone or     accompanied    alone  projecting forward his forehead lined with thick wrinkles  his thin  burnt cheeks  he studied me through the domed glass   a queer fish in a queer aquarium  he assumed a knowing look   well  well  ill be waiting for you   when i returned to my room  i vaguely made out hareys silhouette beyond the curtain of red rays    we can go  my dear       the voice failed me  harey was sitting in an armchair  her arms folded under the armrests  had she heard my footsteps too late  for a second  i saw her fight against the incomprehensible force that inhabited her  overcome this horrible contraction of her whole body and finally relax  a blind fury  mingled with pity  suffocated me  in silence  we followed the long corridor with polychrome walls   the diversity of colors  according to the architects  should make life easier for us inside the armored carapace  from a distance  i noticed that the door of the radio cabin was ajar and let a band of red light through  i looked at harey  who didnt even try to smile  all the way she had been bracing herself for a fight with herself  and now that the ordeal was approaching she had a pale  emaciated face  fifteen paces from the door  she stopped  i turned around  she nudged me with her fingertips  immediately  snaut  my projects  the experiment  the station  everything seemed derisory to me  compared to the torture she was about to undergo  i did not feel a vocation as an assistant executioner  i wanted to retrace my steps  but a shadow cut the reflection of the sun on the wall and i hastened to enter the cabin  snaut had moved towards the door  as if he had intended to come out to meet me  the solar disc haloed her with a purple glow  which seemed to radiate from her gray hair  we looked at each other for a moment without saying anything  if he could study me at his leisure  i didnt see him  for i was dazzled by the blaze from the window  i walked past snaut and went to lean against a high desk  from which the flexible rods of the microphones emerged  snaut turned slowly and continued to observe me with his usual smile  a grimace that did not express cheerfulness and most often betrayed unspeakable fatigue  his eyes still fixed on me  he made his way through the piles of objects piled up in disorder   thermal accumulators  instruments  spare parts for the radio installation  approaching a metal cupboard  he straightened a stool and sat down  his back against the cupboard door  worried  i strained my ears  no sound came from the hallway where i had left harey  why was snaut silent  our silence between them was becoming awkward  i cleared my throat   when will you be ready     we could start today  but the recording takes some time    the record   you mean the encephalogram    yes  you agreed     what is it    no nothing  as the silence continued again  snaut continued   did you have something to tell me   i murmured    she knows     he frowned    ah  i had the impression that he was not really surprised  so why was he pretending to be surprised  i lost all desire to confide in him  yet  out of sheer honesty  i forced myself to speak   she began to have suspicions since our conversation in the library  she spied on me  she added up the clues  then she found gibarians tape recorder and she listened to the tape  leaning against the cupboard  he didnt move  but a faint sparkle brightened his eyes  standing next to the desk  i had in front of me the panel of the half open door to the hallway  i lowered my voice again  last night  while i was sleeping  she tried to kill herself  she absorbed liquid oxygen  there was a rustle of papers driven by a current of air  i stopped talking  paying attention to what was going on in the hallway  the noise wasnt coming from the hallway  it was in the bedroom  a mouse  a mouse  absurd  there were no mice here  stealthily  i observed my companion   im listening   he said quietly    of course  she did not succeed     in any case  she knows who she is   why are you telling me this   at the same time  i did not know what to say  then i mumbled    to inform you     to find out about the situation       i warned you  despite myself  i raised my voice    you mean you knew       what you just told me  of course not  but i explained the situation to you  when he arrives  the  visitor  is almost empty  he is only a ghost nourished by memories and confused images  drawn from his  adam  the longer he stays with you  the more human he becomes  he also becomes more independent  up to a point  and the longer it lasts  the harder it gets  snaut stopped  looked me up and down  and added reluctantly  she knows everything    yes  i have already told you    all   she knows she came a first time and you have       no  he smiled   listen  kelvin  if thats what youre up to  what do you want to do  you want to leave the station    yes    with her     yes  he was silent  pondering his answer  but his silence also meant something else  what  again  i heard close to me   without being able to locate it and as if behind a thin wall   the rustling of an insensible current of air in the room  snaut shifted on his stool   very well   he said  what are you looking at me for  you thought i would put a spoke in your wheels  my dear kelvin  you will do what you want  with the worries we have  we are not going to  on top of that  use coercion on each other  without hoping to convince you  i want to tell you this  in an inhuman situation  you try to maintain a human behavior  it may be very beautiful  but it wont get you anywhere  besides  im not so sure that its beautiful  how could stupid behavior be beautiful  thats not the question  lets get back to our business  you give up pursuing the experiments  you want to leave and take her with you  yes    yes   its also an experience  have you thought about it    what do you mean   you wonder if she  will be able   as long as shes with me  i dont see  speaking more and more slowly  i stopped in the middle of my sentence  snaut sighed  we all have an ostrich policy  my dear kelvin  and we know it  there is no need to put on chivalrous airs   i dont put on any airs   excuse me  i didnt mean to hurt you  i withdraw the chivalrous airs  but i keep the ostrich politics  which you practice in a particularly dangerous form  you lie to yourself  you lie to her  to her  and you go around in circles  do you know the conditions for stabilization of a neutrino structure   no  and neither are you  nobody knows them    in effect  we only know that such a structure is unstable and can only survive through a continuous influx of energy  i learned it from sartorius  this energy creates a swirling stabilizing field  is this magnetic field external to the  visitor   or is it created inside his body  do you get the difference   yes if hes outside she   snaut concludes for me   away from solaris  the structure crumbles  pure hypothesis  of course  but which you can verify  since you have already tried an experiment  the rocket you launched    it continues to gravitate  in my spare time  i even calculated the elements of its movement  you can fly away  place yourself in orbit  approach you and see what has become of the passenger  i yelled    youre crazy   do you think so     what if we brought this rocket back here   no problem  it is remote controlled  well knock it out of orbit and    shut up    no  you do not want either  there is one more way  very simple  it will not be necessary to bring it back to the station  it will continue to gravitate  it will suffice to establish a radio link  if she lives  she will respond and    but  but she hasnt had any oxygen for a long time   maybe she doesnt need oxygen  we try    snaut snaut   he mimicked me angrily   kelvin kelvin think a bit  are you a man  yes or no  who are you trying to please  who do you want to save  you   she   and which of the two  this or that  you dont have enough courage to face them both  you see that your conduct is inconsiderate  i repeat it to you for the last time  we find ourselves in a situation which escapes morality  i heard the same rustle as before  and this time it seemed to me that fingernails were scratching a wall  somehow  i suddenly felt as passive and indifferent as a mule  i saw myself  i saw the two of us from very far away  through the small end of a telescope  and everything seemed to me insignificant  negligible  a little laughable  i asked    well  and according to you  what should i do  push him away  tomorrow she would come back  wouldnt she  and the day after  and every day after  for how long   whats the use of getting rid of it  if it comes back  what benefit will i get from it  and what advantage for you  for sartorius  for the station    no  heres what i suggest  go with her  you will witness the transformation  after a few minutes  youll see     without enthusiasm  i interrupted    what  a monster  a demon   no  youll just see her die  do you really believe in his immortality  i assure you they die  what will you do then  will you be coming back here  to restock  clenching my fists  i shouted   shut up  eyelids narrowed  he looked at me with a condescending mockery    ah  its me who should be quiet  however  it was not me who started this conversation  and i think it has gone on long enough  i recommend other amusements  you could  for example  go whip the ocean with a rod  to get revenge on it  what do you imagine  that youre a scoundrel  if you ship him   he waved his hand sardonically and looked up at the ceiling  as if his eyes were watching a rocket take off   and that you are an honest man  if you keep her   smile when you feel like moaning  feigning joy and peace  when you want to bang your head against the wall  isnt that being a rascal  and if it is impossible  here  not to be a scoundrel  what are you going to do   go wild on that scoundrel snaut  whos responsible for everything  yes   so  my dear kelvin  its because  to make matters worse  you really are a complete idiot  chin down  i replied    you speak for yourself     me     i love him   who     his memory     not her  i told you what she wanted to do  few genuine human beings would have had the courage to do so    by your own words  you recognize       do not quibble with me on the words    good  so she loves you  and you  you want to love him  its not the same thing    youre wrong  im sorry  kelvin  but it was you who told me your intimate concerns  you dont like him  you love it  she is ready to give her life  you also  its very moving  its magnificent  its sublime  whatever you want  but here its misplaced  this is not the place  you understand   no  you refuse to understand it  unknown forces  independent of us  draw you into a circular process  of which she is an aspect  a phase  a periodic manifestation  if she was  if you were bothered by a devoted maritorne  you wouldnt hesitate for a moment to send her away  would you    in effect    well  thats probably why she is not a maritorne  are your hands tied  thats what its all about  that your hands are tied   its just a new hypothesis  added to a million other hypotheses listed in the library  leave me alone  snaut  shes  no  i dont want to talk to you about it anymore    good  you started it  just remember that she is a mirror in which a part of your brain is reflected  if shes wonderful  its because you have wonderful memories  you provided the recipe  you are caught in a circular process  do not forget it    what do you want from me   that i  that i take her away  ive already asked you the question  why   you didnt answer    im going to answer you  i didnt want this conversation  i didnt meddle in your business  i dont order you anything  i dont forbid you anything  and even if i had the right  i wouldnt do it  you came here of your own free will and unpacked everything in front of me  you know why   no   to relieve you of a burden  to relieve you of a weight  ah  my dear kelvin  i know this burden  oh  yes  and dont interrupt me  i leave you free of your decisions  whereas you wish an opposition  if i got in your way  you might try to beat me up  but you would have to deal with me  a man fashioned from the same slime as you  a man of the same flesh and blood as you  and then you too would feel like a man  as i dont give you the opportunity to fight  you argue with me  or rather  you argue with yourself  all you have to do is tell me that you would succumb to the pain  if it suddenly disappeared  no  please dont say anything  i replied awkwardly to her attack    i came to inform you  by simple honesty  that i intend to leave the station with her  snaut shrugged    you do not budge     i expressed my opinion only because i see that you get your head  and the higher we rise  the harder the fall will be  as they say  come tomorrow morning  around nine oclock  to sartoriuss  will you come  i was surprised   at sartoriuss   i thought he didnt let anyone in  you told me we couldnt even call him   looks like he worked it out somehow  we never talk about our domestic problems  you  its entirely different  are you coming tomorrow morning  i growled   ill come   i was watching snaut  his left hand had slipped inside the cupboard  since when was the door ajar  for quite a long time  probably  but in the excitement of this horrible conversation i hadnt noticed anything  the position of this hand was not natural  it looked like he was hiding something  or that he was holding someones hand  i moistened my lips    snaut  what are you       get out  he said in a low voice and very quietly  get out  i went out and closed the door on the last glimmers of red twilight  ten paces from the door  harey was waiting  sitting on the floor  glued to the wall  she jumped up    you see  she said  looking at me with bright eyes  i did it  kris  im so happy  maybe     it may be easier and easier     i replied absently    oh  yes  surely     we went home  i kept worrying about that closet  so that was where he was hiding     and all our conversation     my cheeks were starting to burn so badly that i involuntarily caressed them with the back of my hand  what a stupid conversation  and to achieve what  to nothing  ah  yes  tomorrow morning  suddenly  fear seized me  a fear similar to that which i had experienced the night before  my encephalogram  the entire recording of my brain processes  transformed into a beam of rays  would be discharged into the ocean  into the depths of this inconceivable  infinite monster    what had snaut said   if she disappeared  you would suffer horribly   an encephalogram is a recording of all processes   conscious and unconscious processes  if i wish it to disappear  will it disappear  but if i wanted to get rid of her  would i be so afraid of the annihilation that threatened her  am i responsible for my unconscious  but who else would be responsible for it   what nonsense  why did i agree to give them my encephalogram  of course  i can study the recording before allowing it to be used  but i wont be able to decipher it  no one can decipher it  specialists can only circumscribe the subjects thoughts in general terms  they will say  for example  that the subject was meditating on the solution of a mathematical problem  but will be unable to specify the data of this problem  they are forced to stick to generalities  they assert  because the encephalogram reproduces pell mell a multitude of processes taking place simultaneously  and of which only a part has a psychic  double   what about unconscious processes  specialists absolutely refuse to talk about it  how to demand  therefore  that they decipher more or less repressed memories  but what am i so afraid of  i told harey this very morning that the experiment will not work  if our neurophysiologists are incapable of deciphering the recording  how could this stranger  this black and fluid giant  be able to do so  yet he penetrated me  without my knowledge  he probed my memory and he discovered my most sensitive point  how can you doubt it  without any help  without any beam transmission  he broke through the hermetic shielding  the double shell of the station  he found me and he took his loot   kris  harey whispered  standing in front of the window  staring  i hadnt seen night coming  a thin ceiling of high clouds  a silver cupola faintly reflecting the vanished sun  veiled the stars  if she disappears after the experience  it will mean that i wanted her gone  that i killed her  no  i will not go up to sartorius  i dont have to obey them  what will i tell them  the truth   no  i cant tell them the truth  it will be necessary to play the comedy  to lie  again and again  because there are perhaps in me thoughts  intentions  cruel hopes of which i know nothing  because i am an assassin who ignores himself  man has set out to discover other worlds  other civilizations  without having fully explored his own abysses  his labyrinth of dark corridors and secret chambers  without having pierced the mystery of the doors he himself has condemned  abandon them harey  out of modesty  give it up just because i lack courage   kris   harey said  lower still  she had approached me  i pretended not to have heard her  at this moment  i wanted to isolate myself  i had to isolate myself  i hadnt decided anything yet  taken any resolution  motionless  i contemplated the black sky  the cold stars  pale ghosts of the stars that shone above the earth  my head was suddenly emptied of all thoughts  all i had left was the gloomy certainty of having irremediably crossed a border  indifferent  i refused to know that i was walking towards the inaccessible and i no longer even had the strength to despise myself
