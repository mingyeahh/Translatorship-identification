I was lying in the dark room  Numb  I stared   for how long    the luminous dial of the watch strapped to my wrist  I heard my breathing and I felt a vague astonishment  In fact  I was profoundly indifferent to this ring of phosphorescent numbers and even to my astonishment  I attributed it all to fatigue   numbness  amazement and indifference  I turned on my side  the bed seemed strangely wide to me  I held my breath  no sound disturbed the silence  Harey  Why couldnt I hear him breathe  My arm crossed the surface of the bed  I was alone  I was about to call Harey  when I heard footsteps  A tall  heavy man was approaching  I asked quietly   Gibarian    Yes its me  Dont light the lamp    No     Its not necessary  And its better that we stay in the dark   But are you dead    Dont worry about that   You recognized my voice  didnt you    Yes  Why did you kill yourself   I couldnt do otherwise  You arrived four days late  If you had arrived earlier  I might not have had to kill myself  But dont worry  I regret nothing    Youre really there  I do not sleep   Ah  do you think you dream of me like you thought you dreamed of Harey     Where is she    Why should I know where she is    I have a feeling you know that   Keep your impressions to yourself  Lets say I replace her   I wish she were here too     Its impossible    Why   You know very well that in reality its not you who are here  that its only about me    No  Its really me whos here  Its me again  But lets not waste our time in useless chatter   Are you going back     Yes   And then she will come back    Do you want it   What is it for you    Shes mine  Youre afraid of her    No    She inspires you with repulsion       What do you expect from me   You have the right to feel sorry for yourself  not his  She will always be twenty years old  You know it very well   Suddenly  for no specific reason  I calmed down  I listened to him calmly  It seemed to me that he had come even closer and was now standing at the foot of the bed  I did not see him  the darkness remained impenetrable  I whispered    What do you want  After a moment he replied   Sartorius convinced Snaut that you had tricked him  Now they are trying to trick you  Under the pretext of setting up an X ray emitting device  they build a magnetic field annihilator    Where is she    Dont you hear what Im telling you   I came to warn you    Where is she     I do not know  Be careful   You will need a weapon  You cant rely on anyone   I can count on Harey  I heard a muffled noise  he laughed   Of course  you can count on her  to some extent  And  finally  you can resort to the same expedient as me   You are not Gibarian   Ah  really  and who am I   A dream character    No  You are just a puppet  But you dont know that   And how do you know who you are   I wanted to get up  I couldnt move  Gibarian was speaking  I didnt understand what he was saying  I only heard the sound of his voice  I struggled desperately  trying to overcome the inertia of my body  A jolt and  I woke up  I sucked in the air hungrily  It was dark  I had dreamed  it was a nightmare  And here I heard a distant  monotonous voice    a dilemma  which we are unable to resolve  We persecute ourselves  Polythers only use a kind of selective amplifier of our thoughts  As soon as we try to find the motivation for these phenomena  we fall into anthropomorphism  Where there are no men  there can be no motives accessible to man  In order to continue the search  one must destroy either ones own thoughts or their materialized form  It is not in our power to annihilate our thoughts  As for annihilating their materialized form  that would feel like murder  I immediately recognized Gibarians voice  I felt the sheet beside me  I was alone in bed  I had fallen asleep again  I was dreaming again  I called out to him    Gibarian  The voice broke off in the middle of a word  I heard a low yelp and felt a draft on my face  I yawned  Well  Gibarian  you pursue me from one dream to another  I heard a rustle very close to me  I raised my voice   Gibarian   The springs of the bed creaked  A voice whispered in my ear   Kris its me   Is that you  Harey   And Gibarian   Kris   Kris   but he   you told me he was dead   In a drawling voice  I replied   He can live in a dream   However  I wasnt absolutely certain that I had dreamed    He spoke to me  he was here  I was terribly sleepy  If Im sleepy  I tell myself  I might as well sleep  I brushed my lips against Hareys warm arm and resumed my place in the hollow of the pillow  Harey said something again  but I was already drowsy  In the red morning light  I remembered the events of the night  I had dreamed that I was speaking with Gibarian  But then  I had heard his voice  I would have sworn it under oath  I didnt quite remember what he said  It was no longer a conversation  it sounded like a speech  A speech     Harey was dressing  Water was leaking in the bathroom  I looked under the bed  where a few days earlier I had hidden the tape recorder  He was no longer there   Harey     She showed her face dripping with water    Didnt you see a tape recorder under the bed  a small pocket tape recorder    There were several things under the bed  I put everything on it  She pointed to a shelf  next to the pharmacy  and disappeared into the bathroom  I jumped out of bed  My searches were fruitless  When Harey left the bathroom  I said   Surely you noticed that tape recorder   She didnt answer  she was combing her hair in front of the mirror  Only then did I realize that she was pale and her gaze  when I met it in the mirror  expressed suspicious curiosity  Stubbornly  I continued   Harey  the tape recorder isnt on that shelf    You have nothing more important to tell me  I mumbled   I beg your pardon   Youre right  Im stupid for making such a fuss over a tape recorder  No  absolutely no argument  We went to have our breakfast  Harey was not behaving like other days  but it was impossible for me to define the difference  She looked around her  several times  lost in thought  she did not hear what I was saying to her  And one time when she looked up  I saw her eyes were wet  I whispered   Whats the matter  are you crying   She stammered    Oh  leave me alone  These are not real tears  Maybe I shouldnt have settled for that answer  but I dreaded nothing more than  sincere conversations   I was also preoccupied with other problems  I had dreamed that Snaut and Sartorius were plotting against me and  certain that I had only dreamed  I nevertheless wondered if I would find some defensive weapon in the Station  I worried only about having a weapon  without trying to imagine what I would do with it  I tell Harey I should inspect the stockrooms and warehouse stores  Quietly  she followed me  I rummaged through the crates  poked around in the capsules  and when I got to the bottom  I couldnt help but peek into the central refrigeration unit  I wouldnt let Harey in  I opened the door a crack and looked around the room  The dark shroud covered an elongated form  from the doorway  I was unable to see if the black woman was still sleeping next to Gibarians corpse  It seemed to me that she was no longer there  I couldnt find anything that suited me  I wandered from one store to another and my mood grew more and more sullen  Suddenly  I noticed that Harey had disappeared  She reappeared immediately   she had lingered in the hallway  While it was so painful for her to lose sight of me  even for a moment  she had tried to get away from me  That should have surprised me  Yet I continued to display an offended attitude   but who had offended me    and to behave  in truth  like a moron  I suffered from a severe headache  Enraged  I emptied the entire contents of the pharmacy onto the floor   no trace of antineuralgic pills  I didnt want to go back to the operating room  I didnt want anything  Never had I been in a worse mood  Harey glided like a shadow across the room  from time to time she would withdraw somewhere   I dont know where  I paid her no attention   then she would come back  In the afternoon  in the kitchen  we had just had lunch  but Harey had  in fact  swallowed nothing at all  afflicted with my headache  without appetite myself  I had not attempted to encourage to eat   Harey left his place and came to sit beside me  she pinched the sleeve of my blouse  I growled    What is it  I intended to go up  for the pipes echoed with crackling echoes   Sartorius  it seemed  was fiddling with a high voltage device  But I should have taken Harey with me  Already difficult to justify in the library  his presence risked provoking elsewhere  near the machines  some unfortunate remark on the part of Snaut  I gave up going out   Kris   she whispered   how are we both doing   I sighed in spite of myself  decidedly  I was not in luck that day    Everything is fine  Why     I would like to talk to you    Well  Im listening    Not like this    How   I have a headache  you know  I have a lot of worries      A little good will  Kris  I forced myself to smile  it was surely a miserable smile    Speak  my darling  please   Will you tell me the truth   I frowned  I didnt like this preamble   Why would I lie   Perhaps you have your reasons  serious reasons   But if you want  listen  dont tell me lies    I shut up   Im going to tell you something  and then youll tell me something too  Good   But promise me to answer me the truth  without detours    I avoided his gaze  which sought my eyes   I already told you  I dont know how I got here  You may know that  Hold on   You may not know that  But if you know  and you cant tell me now  will you tell me sometime later  I wouldnt be any the worse for it  and in any case you would give me a chance  An icy blood ran through my veins  I stammered    What are you talking about  my child  what luck   Kris  whoever I am  Im sure Im not a child  You promised to answer   Whoever I am  My throat was tight and I looked at Harey  shaking my head stupidly  as if I was trying not to hear any more   Im not asking you for an explanation  Just tell me youre not allowed to talk  I replied in a hoarse voice    Im not hiding anything from you     She stood up    Very well  I wanted to say something  We couldnt stop there  But the words did not pass   Harey   Standing in front of the window  her back was to me  The blue black ocean stretched out under a bare sky   Harey  if you think  Harey  you know I love you    Me  I approached  I wanted to take her in my arms  She pulled away and pushed my hand away   Youre too good   she said  You love Me   Id rather you beat me   Harey  honey    No  no  shut up  She came back to the table and gathered the plates  I gazed at the ocean  The sun was setting  the Stations shadow lengthened and undulated with the waves  Harey dropped a plate  which fell to the floor  Water was running in the sink  A dull golden arch circled the russet firmament  If only I knew what to do  Oh  if only I knew  Suddenly there was silence  Harey stood behind me   No  dont turn around   she said quietly  Youre not guilty of anything  Kris  I know it  Dont worry  I reached out to grab her  She fled to the back of the kitchen and lifted a pile of plates    Too bad theyre unbreakable  I would gladly break them  I would break them all  For a moment I thought she was really going to throw the plates on the floor  but she looked at me and smiled    Dont be afraid  I wont make a scene  Mind alert  I woke up in the middle of the night  I sat up in bed  The room was dark  through the half open door  a faint light came from the rotunda  I heard an ominous hiss  accompanied by heavy  muffled blows  as if some massive body were furiously hitting a wall  A meteor had struck the shell of the Station  No  not a meteor  a rocket  since I heard a horrible rattle  trailing     I shook myself  There were no more rockets than meteors  Someone was moaning down the hall  I ran in the direction the noise was coming from  I saw a luminous rectangle  the door of the small workshop was open  I rushed inside  An icy vapor enveloped me  My breath fell to snow  White snowflakes swirled above a bathrobe  and under the robe there was a body heaving weakly and hitting the floor  The cloud of frost prevented me from seeing anything distinctly  I threw myself on Harey  seized her round the body  the bathrobe burned my skin  Harey continued to groan  I ran down the hall  I passed several doors  I no longer felt the cold  I only felt a breath  which burned my neck like a flame  I laid Harey on the operating table and pushed the robe aside  Harey  A miserable face  quivering  The lips were covered with a thick  black coating of frozen blood  the tongue sparkled  bristling with ice crystals  Liquid oxygen  The Deware cylinders piled up in the workshop contained liquid oxygen  Shards of glass had cracked under my feet as I approached Harey  How much oxygen had she drunk  No matter   The windpipe  the throat  the lungs  everything was burnt  liquid oxygen gnaws the flesh more surely than concentrated acids  The breathing was fading   a creak  a snap of tearing paper  Her eyes were closed  It was agony  I examined the large glass cabinets filled with instruments and medicines  A tracheotomy  An intubation  She has no more lungs  Medication   So many drugs  Rows of colored bottles and boxes lined the shelves  She was still moaning  a trickle of mist escaped from between his open lips  The thermophores  I started looking for them  then I changed my mind  I ran to another cabinet  I upset boxes of light bulbs  And now  a syringe   where are the syringes  Heres one that needs to be sterilized  I struggled in vain with the lid of the sterilizer  my numb  insensitive fingers refused to bend  The rattle grew louder  I jumped up to Harey  She had opened her eyes   Harey   It hadnt even been a whisper  I was speechless  My face no longer belonged to me  the lips did not obey me  I wore a plaster mask  I looked at Harey  The ribs quivered under the white skin  the snow had melted and damp hair had spread across the headrest  And Harey was looking at me   Harey   I was unable to say more  I stood there stiff as a log  my hands were hanging down  foreign to my body  I felt a burning sensation  which rose from my feet  climbed  attacked my lips  my eyelids  A drop of blood melted and ran down his cheek  drawing an oblique line  The tongue twitched and disappeared  Harey continued to groan  I grab his wrist  I felt no pulse  I stuck my ear under the left breast  against the frozen body  I heard the din of a raging storm and  in the distance  a gallop  the beating of the heart  so accelerated that I could not count them  I remained thus bent over  my eyelids lowered  something touched my head  Harey had run his fingers through my hair  I sat up  She moaned   Kris  I took her hand  she answered my gesture with a pressure that crushed my bones  Then she grimaced horribly and lost consciousness again  I could only see the whites of his eyes  a shrill growl ripped through his throat and convulsions shook his whole body  I had trouble keeping her on the operating table  she escaped me and her head hit the edge of a porcelain basin  I caught up with her  I tried to control her  but every moment a violent spasm lifted her and she tore herself from my embrace  I was dripping with sweat  my legs were wobbly  When the convulsions subsided  I tried to put her to bed  She thrust her chest forward and sucked in the air  Suddenly  eyes  Hareys eyes  lit up that horrible bloody face   Kris since when since when  Kris   She choked  a pink foam rose to his lips  Convulsions seized her again  With the rest of my strength  I clung to his shoulders  She fell on her back  his teeth chattered  She was panting    No  no  no  she sighed hastily  and I thought the end was approaching  But the convulsions started again  And again I held her in my arms  from time to time she sucked in the air painfully and all her ribs stuck out  Then the eyelids half closed over the blind eyes  She stiffened  This time it was the end  I didnt even try to wipe the foam from his lips  I heard a distant ringing  I watched for the last breath   then my strength would completely fail me and I would crumble to the ground  She continued to breathe  the rattle was no more than a light hiss  The chest  which no tremor no longer agitated  began to come alive again to the rapid rhythm of the beating of the heart  Cheeks flushed  With my back arched  I gazed at her  I didnt understand yet  My palms were sweaty  a soft and supple material covered my ears  yet I heard this ringing which persisted  Harey lifted his lids and our eyes met  I wanted to pronounce his name  no sound crossed my lips  My face remained dead  I still wore this heavy mask  I could only watch her  She moved her head  surveying the room  Somewhere behind me  in another world  water was dripping from a poorly closed tap  Harey leaned on one elbow  she sat down  I stepped back  She was watching me  What  she said  what is it  It didnt work  Why why are you looking at me like that    And  suddenly  an atrocious cry  Why are you looking at me like that  The silence  She looked at her hands  wiggled her fingers    Its me   she asked  With lip service  in one breath  I said   Harey   She repeated   Harey  Slowly  she slid over the edge of the operating table  She staggered  regained her balance  and took a few steps  She was acting in a stupor  she looked at me without seeming to see me   Hary   she repeated again  But  Im not Harey  Who am I   Hary  And you  you  His eyes widened  sparkled  and a surprised smile lit up his face   And you  Kris   Maybe you too  I was silent  I had backed up to the wall  I was leaning against a closet door  The smile faded  No  she said  No  you are afraid  But I cant stand this situation  Its impossible  I knew nothing about it  Even now  I dont understand anything  No its impossible   I   She clenched her white fists and slapped her chest   I didnt know anything except  except that I was Harey   Do you think Im acting  Im not acting  I swear  Im not acting  She moaned the last words and collapsed on the floor sobbing  Something gave way inside me  With one bound  I was near her and I surrounded her with my arms  She struggled  pushed me away  sobbing without tears  and she cried   Leave me  leave me   I disgust you  I know it  I dont want  I dont want  You can see its not me  not me  not me    I shook her and yelled  Shut up  Kneeling in front of each other  we were both screaming  Hareys head fell on my shoulder  I hugged her to me with all my might  Panting  we did not move  Water dripped from the faucet  She stammered  her face in the crook of my shoulder   Kris  tell me what I have to do to disappear  Kris  I yelled   Shut up  She raised her head and looked at me    What  you either  you do not know  We cant do anything  nothing   Harey  please    I tried     No  no  leave me  I do not want you to touch me  I disgust you    Its not true   Youre lying   I disgust you   and I disgust myself too   oh  if only I could  if only I could    Would you kill yourself     Yes   And I dont want to   You understood   I dont want you to die  I want you here  with me  I dont want anything else  The big gray eyes stared at me   Youre lying   she said softly  I released her and got up  she remained seated on the floor   Tell me what I have to do to make you believe me   I swear to you that I am not lying  Only you exist  only you count for me   Theres no way youre telling the truth  since Im not Harey    So who are you   She was silent for a long moment  Several times his chin quivered  Finally  she lowered her head and whispered   Harey but I know thats not true  Its not me    that you once loved    Indeed  but the past no longer exists  the past is dead  Here  today  it is you that I love  You understand   She shook her head   Youre good   Dont think I dont appreciate everything youve done  You acted for the best  you did everything you could  But there is nothing to do  The first morning  when I was waiting beside your bed for you to wake up  I knew nothing  Only three days have passed  but it seems like a long  long time ago  I was behaving like crazy  My head was full of fog  I didnt remember anything  I wasnt surprised at anything   I felt like you feel after a narcosis  or after a long illness  I even thought that maybe I had been sick  and that you didnt want to tell me  Then certain events gave me food for thought  You know what Im referring to  Then you had this conversation in the library  with this man   whats his name    Snaut  yes  You refused to explain anything to me  so I got up at night and listened to the tape on the tape recorder  I only lied that one and only time  Kris   when you were looking for the tape recorder  I knew where it was  I hid it  The man who recorded this tape   whats his name    Gibarian   Yes  Gibarian  Listening to it  I understood everything  Although in truth I continue to understand nothing  I just didnt know that I cant  that Im not  that theres no end  He didnt say anything about it  He may have said it  but you woke up  and I turned off the tape recorder  I had heard enough to learn that I am not a human being  but an instrument    What are you talking about     Yes  To study your reactions  or something like that  Each one of you has a  an instrument like me  We come out of your memories  or your imagination  Im not sure  Besides  you know all that better than me  He tells such terrible  implausible things  If it didnt tally with the rest  I surely wouldnt have believed him    The rest    Oh  the fact that I dont need to sleep  and that I have to follow you everywhere  Yesterday I thought you hated me and that made me unhappy  What an idiot  But how could I have imagined the truth  He  Gibarian  he didnt hate this woman at all  who was with him  but he talks about it in such a way    so appalling  Only then did I understand that nothing depended on me  that I could do this or that  it doesnt matter  it would always be torture for you  Worse than torture  because the instruments of torture are passive and innocent  as innocent as the stone that falls and kills you  That an instrument of torture loves you and wishes you well was beyond my comprehension  I would have liked to tell you all that  to communicate to you the little that I had understood  I thought this might be useful to you  I even tried to take notes     I cleared my throat and asked painfully    Is that why you had lit a lamp    Yes  But I couldnt write anything  I was looking within myself for this  you know  this  influence   I was panicked  It seemed to me that I had no body under my skin  that in me there was something  different  that I was only an appearance  destined to deceive you  You understand     I understand    When we do not sleep at night  and we think for hours  we go very far in thought  you know  and we engage on strange paths       Yes  I know   But I felt my heart beating  And I remembered that you tested my blood  How is it  my blood  tell me  tell me the truth  Now you can tell me the truth   Your blood is like mine    Truly     I swear to you    What does it mean   I was thinking that maybe this    this unknown thing was hiding somewhere inside me  maybe taking up very little space  But I didnt know where it was hiding  Now I think I was trying to come up with a subterfuge  because I couldnt make up my mind  I was scared  I was looking for another way out  But  Kris  if I have the same blood as you  if really  No  its impossible  I would be dead already  wouldnt I  This means that there is still a difference  Where is the difference   In the head   But I guess I think like any other human being   and I dont know  If this unknown thing was thinking in my head  I would know everything  And I wouldnt love you  Id be acting  knowing Im acting  Kris  please tell me everything you know  Maybe we will find a solution    Which solution     She was silent    Would you like to die    Yes I think  Again silence  Harey sat hunched over  I surveyed the room  the furniture painted in white enamel  the sparkling instruments  my gaze desperately tried to catch hold of some hitherto unsuspected beacon which would suddenly have revealed itself   Harey  can I say something too     She waited silently    Its true  youre not exactly like me  But this finding is not pejorative  On the contrary  Whatever your opinion on this subject  it is thanks to this  difference  that you are not dead  She gave a painful little smile  the smile of a sad child  Does that mean Im immortal    I do not know  In any case  you are much less vulnerable than me  She whispered    Its awful       Maybe less awful than you think  But you dont envy me   Harey  I dont know what  fate awaits you  Truth be told  your fate is as unpredictable as mine  as unpredictable as the fate of any of the Stations inhabitants  The experiment will continue  and anything can happen       Or nothing    Or nothing  And I confess to you that I prefer that nothing happens  Not because Im afraid  although fear no doubt plays its part in this affair   but because there will be no outcome  Of that I am absolutely certain   What outcome   Are you talking about this  ocean  She shivered    Yes  contact with the ocean  I think the problem is actually very simple  A contact means the exchange of certain knowledge  of certain notions  or at least of certain results  of certain facts   but if there is no possible exchange  If the elephant is not a giant microbe  the ocean is not a giant brain  On both sides  of course  attempts can be made  And the consequence of one of these attempts is that you are here  now  with me  And I try to explain to you that I love you  Your very presence erases the twelve years of my life that I have devoted to the study of Solaris  and I want to keep you with me  Were you sent to me to torture me  or to soften my existence  or are you only an instrument ignorant of its function and which is used to examine me as through a microscope  Are you being used to show me friendship  to deal me an insidious blow  or to make fun of me  Perhaps all of this at the same time  or perhaps   and this is most likely   it is something quite different  But why worry about the intentions of our parents   even if our procreators look nothing alike  You will answer that our future depends on these intentions  and I will not contradict you  No more than you do I foresee the future  I cant even assure you that I will always love you  Given what happened  anything is to be expected  Maybe tomorrow I will be transformed into a green jellyfish  Nothing depends on us  But since its up to us to make a decision today  lets decide to stay together  What do you say    Listen  I would like to ask you again  Do I  do I look a lot like her    You looked a lot like him  Now I dont know anymore    I do not understand     She had risen and looked at me with her huge eyes    Its just you    And youre sure its not her  its only me  me that       Yes  you  If you were really her  maybe I couldnt love you    Why   Because I did something horrible   Were you mean to her     Yes  when we       Do not say anything    Why    So you dont forget that its me whos here  not her
