 kris  is it because of this experience  the sound of his voice struck me by surprise  i stiffened  lying in the dark  i wasnt asleep  i hadnt closed my eyes  for long hours  no longer hearing her breath  i had forgotten her  solitary  i had let myself be carried away by the confused current of nocturnal thoughts  pursuing the delusions of my waking dream  i had lost sight of the exact measure and meaning of reality    what     how do you know im not sleeping    when you sleep  you breathe differently  she said softly  as if to be forgiven for this remark  i didnt want to bother you  if you cant answer me  dont answer    why couldnt i talk  yes  you guessed it  its that experience   what do they hope for    they dont know themselves  something  anything  its not  operation thought   its  operation despair   truth be told  one of us would have to have the courage to cancel the experiment and take responsibility for the decision on ourselves  but the majority considers that this courage is only scare  and that to cancel the experiment is to give the signal of retirement  of renunciation  of a flight unworthy of man  as if it were worthy of man to flounder  to get bogged down  to drown in what he does not understand and will never understand    i stopped  but almost immediately a new fit of anger unleashed me    of course  they are not short of arguments  they claim that even if we fail to make contact  we will not have wasted our time studying this plasma   all these living cities that emerge all day long and disappear   and that we will eventually unlock the secret of matter  they know perfectly well that they are fooling themselves  that they are walking in the middle of a library where all the books are written in an incomprehensible language and where only the color of the bindings is recognizable   are there no other planets like this one     maybe     we do not know  its the only one we know  in any case  it is an extremely rare species   not like the earth  earth is a common species   the grass of the universe    and we boast of this universality  we imagine that nothing can remain foreign to us  with this idea  bold and joyful  we left for other worlds  and these other worlds  what were we going to do with them  to dominate them or to be dominated by them  that was all in our unfortunate brains  ah  what useless pain  what useless pain  i got up  i groped my way through the pharmacy  my fingers recognized the large  flat bottle containing the sleeping pills  i turned in the dark    im going to sleep my dear    under the ceiling  the fan hummed    i have to sleep  i have to  i sat down on the bed  harey touched my hand  i rocked forward  grabbed harey in my arms  and we lay still  pressed together  i fell asleep  in the morning  i woke up refreshed and rested  the experiment seemed to me a very small matter  i did not understand how i could attribute such importance to my encephalogram  nor did i worry much about having to introduce harey into the lab  despite all her efforts  she couldnt bear to stay more than five minutes without seeing and hearing me  so i had given up trying to continue  she was even ready to allow herself to be locked up somewhere  and  asking her to come with me  i advised her to bring a book  i was especially curious about what i would find in the laboratory  the appearance of the large blue and white room presented nothing particular  except that the shelves and cupboards intended for the storage of glass instruments seemed sparsely stocked  the panel of a glass door was split in a star  and a few doors did not have a panel  these details led one to suppose that a struggle had taken place here recently  the traces of which had been erased as much as possible  snaut  who was busy with a device  behaved fairly well  he showed no surprise at seeing harey enter and greeted her with a slight bow  i had stretched out  snaut was moistening my temples and forehead with saline when a small door opened and sartorius stepped out of an unlit room  he had put on a white lab coat and a black anti radiation apron  which fell to his ankles  he greeted me authoritatively  looking very professional  as if we were in some great institute on earth  two researchers among hundreds of other scholars  continuing the work of the day before  he had his dark glasses off  but i noticed he was wearing contact lenses  i thought i could explain his expressionless gaze in this way  arms folded across his chest  sartorius watched snaut  who had the electrodes in place and was wrapping a white band around my head  several times sartorius looked around the room  he ignored harey  curled up on top of a stool  leaning against a wall  unhappy  she pretended to read her book  snaut having stepped back  i moved my head laden with metal discs and electric wires  to watch him switch on the ignition  but sartorius  raising his hand  began to speak with unction   dr  kelvin  i ask you for a moment of attention and concentration  i have no intention of dictating any precise course of thought to you  for that would distort the experience  but i urge you to stop thinking about yourself  me  our fellow snaut  or whoever  strive to eliminate any intrusion of definite personalities and focus on the business that brought us here  earth and solaris  the body of scholars considered as a single whole  although generations have succeeded each other and man  as an individual  has a limited existence  our aspirations and perseverance to establish intellectual contact  the long historical journey of humanity  the certainty we have of continuing this progression  our determination to give up all personal feelings to accomplish our mission  the sacrifices we are willing to make  the difficulties we are preparing to overcome  here is a series of themes which should be nourished by your conscience  the association of ideas is not entirely dependent on your will  however  the very fact that you are here guarantees the authenticity of the development that i have just presented  if you are not sure if you have completed your task  please say so  and our colleague snaut will start the recording again  we dont miss the time  as he pronounced these last words  he had sketched a dry little smile  but his gaze remained morose  i tried to unravel the pompous phrases he had given me with the utmost seriousness  snaut broke the lingering silence   are we going  kris   he asked  his elbow on the control panel of the electroencephalograph  he seemed to be leaning carelessly on the back of a chair  i liked his confident tone  and i was grateful to him for calling me by my first name  i closed my eyes    lets go  when snaut  having fixed the electrodes  approached the control panel  a sudden anguish oppressed me  now that anxiety was just as suddenly dissipated  through my lowered eyelashes  i saw the red glow of the control lamps on the cameras blackboard  i no longer felt the damp and unpleasant contact of the metal electrodes  that crown of cold medallions that surrounded my head  my mind was a gray  empty arena  surrounded by a crowd of invisible spectators  massed on bleachers  attentive to my silence   and from this silence emanated an ironic contempt for sartorius and the mission  what was i going to improvise for all these spectators inside myself  harey   i put his name forward worriedly  ready to withdraw it immediately  but there was no protest  i persevered  i intoxicated myself with tenderness and pain  i was willing to patiently endure long sacrifices  harey filled me completely  she had no body  no face  it breathed in me  real and imperceptible  suddenly  as if superimposed on this desperate presence  i saw in the gray semi darkness the learned and professorial face of giese  the father of solaristics and solarists  i didnt think of the muddy rash  the nauseating abyss that had engulfed his gold glasses and carefully brushed mustache  i saw the engraving on the title page of the monograph  the tight pencil strokes with which the draftsman had haloed the head  a head that so much resembled that of my father   not in the features  but in the expression of antique wisdom and honesty   that in the end i no longer knew which of the two was looking at me  my father or giese  they were dead  neither had received a burial   but  in our time  the unburied dead are not uncommon  the image of giese faded  and for a moment i forgot the station  the experiment  harey  the black ocean  immediate memories vanished before the overwhelming certainty that these two men  my father and giese  now turned to dust  had once faced all the events of their lives  and from this certainty i drew a deep peace  which annihilated the shapeless crowd massed around the gray arena awaiting my defeat  i heard the clicking of switches  the light from the lamps penetrated my eyelids  i blinked  sartorius had not moved  he was watching me  snaut  his back turned  was poking around the camera  and it seemed to me that he enjoyed clicking the sandals that slipped from his feet   do you think  dr  kelvin  that the first stage of the experiment was successful   sartorius asked in that nasal voice i hated    yes   are you sure of that   he insisted with a little astonishment  and perhaps even mistrust    yes  for a brief moment  my confidence and the harsh tone of my answer triumphed over his stiffness   ah  good   he mumbled  looking helpless  snaut walked over to me and began unrolling the bands around my head  sartorius backed away  hesitated  then disappeared into the dark room  i was stretching my legs when sartorius reappeared  holding the already developed and dried film in his hand  trembling lines outlined white lace on fifteen yards of shiny black ribbon  my presence was no longer useful  but i stayed  snaut fed the film into the modulators oxidized head  sartorius  his eyes sad and wary  looked once more at the end of the ribbon  as if trying to decipher the content of those vibrating lines  the start of the experiment was nothing spectacular  snaut and sartorius had each sat at a control panel and were working buttons  through the armored floor i heard the muffled rumble of current in the coils  the luminous lines fell along the glass tubes of the counters  signifying that the body of the enormous x ray cannon descended to place itself at the orifice of the shaft which sheltered it  the luminous lines stopped at the minima  snaut raised the tension  the white arrow of the voltmeter described a semi circle from left to right  now the hum of the current was barely audible  the film unrolled  invisible under two spherical hoods  numbers jumped with a slight jingle in the meter indicator light  i approached harey  who was watching us over his book  she gave me a questioning look  the experiment had just ended  sartorius was moving towards the large conical head of the device  hareys lips drew a mute question   are we leaving   i responded with an affirmative nod  harry stood up  without taking leave of anyone  we left the room  a wonderful twilight lit up the windows of the hallway on the upper floor  the horizon was not russet and gloomy  as usual at this hour  but a shimmering pink  speckled with silver  under the soft caress of the light  the dark undulations of the ocean had soft violet reflections  the sky was red only at its zenith  when we got to the bottom of the stairs  i stopped  i couldnt bear the thought that we were going to be locked in my cabin again  like in a prison cell   harey   id like to see something in the library   do you mind   with a somewhat forced animation  she exclaimed    oh  no  ill find something to read  since the day before  i was aware of it  a gap had grown between us  i should have been more cordial  overcome my apathy  but where to draw the strength to shake off this torpor  we went down the ramp that led to the library  in the small vestibule there were three doors and flowers under crystal globes tiered against the walls  i opened the middle door  covered with synthetic leather on both sides   when entering the library  i always avoided touching this upholstery  a pleasant breath of fresh air greeted me  the great circular hall  despite the stylized sun painted on the ceiling  had not warmed up  caressing absently the spines of the books  i was about to choose  among all the classics of solaris  the first volume of giese  in order to see again the portrait adorning the title page  when i discovered by chance the work of gravinsky  an in   octavo with cracked binding  which i had not noticed before  i sat down on an upholstered chair  harey  sitting next to me  was leafing through a book  i heard him turn the pages  gravinskys compendium  which students usually consulted as an aide memoire  was an alphabetical classification of solarist hypotheses  the compiler  who had never seen solaris  had sifted through all the monographs  all the expedition reports  the fragmentary overviews  and the provisional communications  he had even fished out quotations from the books of planetary scientists studying other globes  he had drawn up an inventory abounding with simplistic formulations  which grossly reduced the subtleties of the original thought  the work  conceived with encyclopaedic pretensions  was now little more than a curiosity  gravinskys compendium had appeared twenty years earlier  but since then so many new hypotheses had accumulated that a single book would not have sufficed to contain them  i skimmed through the index  almost an obituary  for a small number of the authors cited were still living  among the survivors  none were more actively involved in solarist studies  reading all these names  measuring the sum of intellectual efforts exerted in all directions  one could not help thinking that at least one of the hypotheses formulated must be right  and that the thousands of hypotheses put forward must each contain some grain of truth   that the reality could not be entirely different  in his introduction  gravinsky divided the first sixty years of solarist studies into periods  during the initial period   which began with the expedition sent to reconnoitre over the planet   no one had  strictly speaking  formulated any hypotheses   common sense  then intuitively admitted that the ocean was a lifeless chemical conglomerate  a gelatinous mass  which by its  quasi volcanic  activity produced wondrous creations and stabilized its unstable orbit through an autogenous mechanical process  just as a pendulum remains on a fixed plane after being set in motion  to tell the truth  three years after the first expedition  magenon had put forward the idea that the  colloidal machine  was alive  but  in gravinsky  the period of biological hypotheses did not begin until nine years later  at a time when the opinion of magenon  previously discarded  had acquired many partisans  the following years abounded in theoretical descriptions of the living ocean  extremely complex descriptions  supported by biomathematical analysis  during the third period  scholarly opinion  hitherto more or less unanimous  became divided  a host of rival schools emerged  fighting furiously  it was the time of panmaller  of strobel  of freyhouss  of le greuille  of osipowicz  gieses entire legacy was subjected to merciless criticism  the first atlases and the first inventories appeared  stereophotographs of asymmetriads were presented  until recently considered as creations impossible to explore   new remote controlled instruments had been introduced inside these formidable colossi  which an unpredictable explosion could tear apart at any moment  in the tumult of the discussions  one dismissed with contempt the  minimal  hypotheses  even if one did not manage to establish this famous  contact  with the  reasonable monster   considered some  it was worth studying the cartilaginous cities of the mimoids and blown mountains rising from the surface of the ocean  because we could acquire valuable chemical and physicochemical knowledge  and enrich our experiments in the field of the structure of giant molecules  but no one deigned to engage in controversy with the partisans of such theses  inventories of typical metamorphoses  catalogs whose authority remains today  were busy  and frank developed his bioplasmatic theory of mimoids   although this proved inaccurate  it remains a superb example of intellectual impetuosity  and of logical construction  these first three  gravinsky periods    thirty odd years   this candid assurance  this irresistibly optimistic romanticism  were the youth of solaristics  already  with skepticism  middle age was announced  by the end of the first quarter of a century  the old colloidomechanical hypotheses had found distant descent in the theory of the apsychic ocean  the almost unanimous opinion judged aberrant the point of view of a whole generation of scholars  who had thought they were observing the manifestations of a conscious will  teleological processes  an activity motivated by some inner necessity in the ocean  the press  in passionately refuting this view  cleared the ground for the holden  eonides and stoliwa team  whose lucid  analytically grounded speculations centered on a careful examination of ever accumulating data  this was the golden age of archivists  the microfilm libraries were overflowing with documents  the expeditions  some numbering more than a thousand members  were lavishly equipped with all the sophisticated devices earth could provide   automatic recorders  probes  detectors  but  as the material piled up at an ever increasing rate  the very spirit of the search became bogged down  and during this period  still optimistic despite everything  a decline began  courageous men  such as giese  strobel  sevada  daring in the affirmation or the negation of a theoretical conception  had marked this first phase of solaristics with their personality  sevada  the last of the great solarists  had inexplicably disappeared near the planets south pole  apparently  he was the victim of an imprudence  which even a novice would not have committed  hovering at low altitude above the ocean  under the eyes of a hundred observers  he had thrown his plane into an agilus  which however did not bar his way  there had been talk of sudden weakness  fainting  failure of the control system  in reality  in my opinion  it is the first suicide  a first and sudden crisis of despair  there were other  crises   but gravinskys book did not mention them  contemplating the yellowed pages  covered with tight characters  i found in myself the facts  the dates  the details that i knew  subsequently  moreover  the manifestations of despair were fortunately less violent   outstanding personalities were also rarer among scholars  we have never studied  as a phenomenon in itself  the recruitment of scholars destined to study a specific field of planetary science  each generation counts an almost constant number of men endowed with a brilliant mind and great strength of character  only the paths in which they engage differ  the presence or absence of such men in a given sector of research can no doubt be explained by the prospects that this sector opens up to the scientific approach  one can variously appreciate the researchers of the classical era of solaristics  but no one can deny their greatness  even their genius  for a few decades  the mysterious ocean had attracted the best mathematicians  the best physicists  the eminent specialists in biophysics  information theory and electrophysiology  and suddenly the army of seekers seemed leaderless  there remained a gray and anonymous crowd of patient  collectors   compilers  skilled in imagining some original experiments  but there was no longer a succession of vast expeditions conceived on the scale of the entire globe  and no high profile hypothesis  stimulating by its audacity  hardly stirred scholarly circles any longer  the monument of solaristics was deteriorating  like the moss that gnaws at the stone  the hypotheses multiplied  differentiated only in secondary details  and unanimously embroidering on the theme of the degeneration  the regression  the involution of the ocean  every now and then a bolder and more interesting design would stand out from the crowd  but always it was something of a condemnation of the ocean  the end product of a development that had long ago   thousands of years earlier   passed through a phase of higher organization  the ocean had now only a physical unity and its multiple creations  useless  absurd  were bursts of agony   fantastic agony  certainly  which had been going on for centuries  thus  the longus or the mimoides were tumors  all the processes observed on the surface of the enormous fluid body expressed chaos and anarchy  this way of looking at the problem turned into an obsession  for seven or eight years the scholarly literature poured out in courteous terms assertions which were  in spite of oratorical precautions  but a heap of insults   revenge of a host of misguided solarists  deprived of leaders  against the object of their assiduous care  which did not depart from its indifference and stubbornly ignored all the advances  a team of european psychologists had carried out a public opinion poll  spread over an extended period of time  their report  indirectly linked to solaristics  was not among the works collected in the library of the station  but i had studied it and i remembered it very well  systematically collecting profane statements  the investigators had demonstrated in a striking manner that changes in current opinion followed very closely the fluctuations of opinion recorded in scholarly circles  within the coordination commission of the planetological institute  which decided on the material support granted to research  the change was manifested by a gradual reduction in the budget of the institutes and posts devoted to solaristics  as well as by restrictions affecting exploration teams  certain scholars  however  had taken an absolutely opposite position and called for more energetic means of action  the administrative director of the universal cosmological institute went so far as to stubbornly affirm that the living ocean in no way disdained men  but had not noticed them   just as an elephant neither sees nor smells the ants that wander on his back  to attract the attention of the ocean and retain it for a long time  it was necessary to implement powerful stimuli and gigantic machines designed to the dimensions of the entire planet  a piquant detail  which the press mischievously pointed out  was that the director of the cosmological institute generously invited people to dip into the pockets of others  since it was the planetological institute that should have financed these costly expeditions  the hypotheses continued to rain down   old  refreshed  hypotheses  superficially modified  simplified or complicated to the extreme   and solaristics  a relatively clear discipline despite its amplitude  became an increasingly confusing labyrinth  where each apparent solution ended in dead end  in a climate of general indifference  stagnation and discouragement  the ocean of solaris was covered with an ocean of printed paper  two years before the start of my internship in the laboratory of the department headed by gibarian   at the end of this internship  i had obtained the diploma of the institute   the mettirving foundation  recently created for this sole purpose  promised the highest rewards to anyone who would find a way to usefully exploit the energy of the ocean  the idea was not new  the cosmic ships had already brought back to earth many cargoes of plasma jelly  patiently  we tried various preservation methods  high and low temperatures  micro atmosphere and artificial microclimates  reproducing the atmospheric and climatic conditions of solaris  prolonged irradiation    we deployed a whole arsenal of physical and chemical processes  to finally observe   and invariably  a more or less slow process of decomposition  passing through abundantly described stages  consumption  maceration  first degree liquefaction  called primary  and late liquefaction  called secondary  samples taken from plasma blooms and creations met a similar fate  with some variations in the decomposition process  but  in the final stage  the material always dissipated by self fermentation into a light ash with metallic reflections  any solarist could  however  establish the composition of the matter studied  specify the ratios of the elements and the chemical characteristics  scientists having recognized that it was impossible to keep alive   or even in a vegetative state  in  hibernation    any fragment  small or large taken from the ocean and dissociated from the monstrous organism  we became convinced  developed by the school of meunier and proroch  that the key to the mystery depended only on how to approach it and that when we had found the correct method of interpretation  the whole problem would be solved  the search for this key  this philosophers stone of solaris  had absorbed the time and energy of a crowd of people who generally had no scientific training  during the fourth decade of solaristics  a true epidemic had spread  which had moved the psychologists  an incalculable number of maniacs  ignorant obsessions  devoted themselves to their groping research  with a zeal which surpassed that of the ancient prophets of the perpetual motion or squaring the circle  this passion  however  died out after a few years  at the time when i was preparing to leave for solaris  for a long time there was no longer any question of the famous epidemic in the newspapers  nor in conversations  where there was hardly any worry about the ocean  as i put gravinskys abstract back on its shelf and i was careful to respect the alphabetical arrangement i brushed past a thin pamphlet by grattenstrom  one of the most bizarre authors in solaristic literature  i knew this pamphlet  it was a pamphlet  dictated by the concern to understand what goes beyond man  and specifically directed against the individual  man  the human species   the abstract and aggressive work of an autodidact  who had previously made a series of unusual contributions to certain marginal  highly specialized areas of quantum physics  in this booklet of about fifteen pages   and yet his capital work     the polemicist endeavored to demonstrate that the most abstract achievements of science  the haughtiest theories  the highest mathematical conquests meant only a ridiculous progress  a step or two forward  compared to our understanding  prehistoric  crude  anthropomorphic  of the surrounding world  seeking the correspondents of the human body   the projections of our senses  of the structure of our organism  of the physiological conditions which limit man   in the formulas of the theory of relativity  in the theorem of magnetic fields  in parastatics  in the hypotheses concerning the unified field of the cosmos  grattenstrom had concluded that there was no question  and could never be a question  of any  contact  of man with an extra human civilization  in this pamphlet against humanity  there was no mention of the living ocean  however  between the lines one felt his constant presence  his contemptuous and triumphant silence  such  at least  had been my impression on studying this pamphlet  which gibarian had pointed out to me  and which he had certainly added on his own authority to the collection of classic works at the station   grattenstroms pamphlet being considered a curiosity  but not like a real solarianum  with a strange  awe like feeling  i carefully slipped the thin pamphlet between the books tight on the shelf  i stroked the bronze green binding of the solaris yearbook with my fingertips  in a few days  incontestably  we had acquired certainties concerning some fundamental questions  which had caused floods of ink to flow and fueled so many disputes that had remained fruitless for lack of arguments  today  even when the mystery surrounded us from all sides  we had strong arguments  was the ocean a living creature  one could not go on doubting it  unless one took pleasure in paradoxes or stubbornness  it was becoming impossible to deny the  psychic functions  of the ocean   no matter what exactly the term meant  it was obvious  in any case  that the ocean had  seen  us only too well    this single observation invalidated the solarist theories proclaiming that the ocean was an  inner world    a  reclusive life    deprived by process involute of organs of thought having once existed  ignorant of the existence of external objects and phenomena  prisoner of a gigantic whirlwind of mental currents created and confined in the abysses of this monster revolving between two suns  better still  we had discovered that the ocean knew how to reproduce what we ourselves had never succeeded in creating by artificial synthesis   the human body  a perfected human body  modified in its infra atomic structure  in order to serve inconceivable  the ocean lived  thought  acted  the  solaris problem  was not negated by its very absurdity  we were indeed dealing with a creature  the lost part was by no means lost  that seemed to have been definitively acquired  willingly or unwillingly  men had to consider this neighbor  from whom they were separated by a void of several billion kilometers and by light years  a neighbor yet located in our expansion zone and more disturbing than all the rest of the universe  we had perhaps reached a turning point in history  which decision would prevail in high places  would we be ordered to give up  to return to earth  immediately or in the near future  would we even be ordered to liquidate the station  it wasnt impossible  at least not unlikely  i did not believe  however  in the solution by flight  the existence of the thinking colossus would no longer cease to torment men  even if man had explored cosmic space in all directions  even if he had established relations with other civilizations  founded by creatures like us  solaris would remain an eternal challenge  i discovered  lost among the thick volumes of the directory  a small leather bound book  i looked at the worn cover for a moment  it was an old book  introduction to solaristics  by muntius  i had read it in one night  gibarian  with a smile  had lent me his copy  and  when i had come to the word  end   the dawn of a new day on earth lit up my window  solaristics  wrote muntius  is the surrogate religion of the cosmic age  it is faith  disguised as science  contact  that goal of solaristics  is no less vague and obscure than the communion of saints or the return of the messiah  the exploration is a liturgy according to the formulas of the methodology  the humble work of the scholars is only the expectation of a fulfillment  of an annunciation  because there do not exist and cannot exist bridges between solaris and the earth  the comparison is obvious  the solarists reject arguments   no common experiences  no transferable notions   just as believers rejected arguments that undermined the foundations of their faith  besides  what can men expect  what can men hope for from an  information link  with the living ocean  a catalog of the vicissitudes associated with an existence infinite in time  and so old that it probably has no memory of its origins  a description of the yearnings  passions  hopes and sufferings that are released through the chronic creation of living mountains  the promotion of mathematics to embodied existence  the revelation of plenitude in isolation and renunciation  but all this represents intransmissible knowledge  transposed into any human language  the values and meanings sought lose all substance   they cannot be passed on to the other side of the barrier  moreover  the  followers  do not expect such revelations   of the order of poetry  rather than of science   because  unconsciously  it is the revelation that they are waiting for  a revelation which would explain to them the meaning of the destiny of man  solaristics resurrects long dead myths  it translates mystical nostalgia  which men no longer dare to express openly  the cornerstone  deeply buried in the foundations of the edifice  is the hope of redemption    unable to recognize this truth  the solarists cautiously avoid any interpretation of contact  presented in their works as a final outcome  whereas primitively lucid minds considered it as a beginning  an opening  an incursion on a new path  among many other possible paths  over the years  the contact has been sanctified   it has become the sky of eternity  muntius analyzes very simply  and with bitterness  this  heresy  of planetology  he brilliantly dismantles the solarist myth  or rather the myth of the mission of man  first discordant voice  the work of muntius had come up against the disdainful silence of scholars  at a time when they still had romantic confidence in the development of solaristics  how  indeed  could they have approved a thesis which denounced the very bases of their work  solaristics continued to wait for someone who would solidly re establish its foundations and rigorously set its borders  five years after the death of muntius  when his book had become the white blackbird of bibliophiles   almost impossible to find  both in the collections of solariana and in libraries specializing in philosophy   a group of norwegian researchers founded a school bearing the name of the scientist  in contact with the personality of his various spiritual heirs  the serene thought of the master undergoes profound transformations  it leads to the corrosive irony of erle ennesson and  on a lower level  to the  utilitarian solarism   or  utilitarianism   of phaeleng  this recommended focusing on the immediate benefits that explorations could bring without worrying about any intellectual communion between two civilizations  any utopian contact  compared to the implacable and limpid analysis of muntius  the works of his disciples are however little more than compilations  even simple works of popularization  with the exception of the treatises of enneson  and perhaps studies of takata   muntius himself had already outlined the full development of solarist views  he called the first phase of solaristics the age of the  prophets   among whom he counted giese  holden  and sevada  he called the second phase the  great schism    the bursting of the single solarist church into a host of antagonistic chapels  he foresaw a third phase  which would arise when everything had been explored  and which would manifest itself in a scholastic and sclerotic dogmatics  this prediction  however  was to prove inaccurate  in my opinion  gibarian was right when he called the attack carried out by muntius a monumental simplification  neglecting all that in solaristics was the opposite of a faith  since the work constantly pursued only reported the material reality of a globe revolving around two suns  in muntiuss book i found an offprint of the quarterly review parerga solariana  yellowed pages  folded in half  one of the first articles written by gibarian  even before his appointment as head of the institute  the article  entitled why i am a solarist  began with a brief enumeration of all the material phenomena justifying the chances of a contact  gibarian belonged to this generation of researchers  who had the audacity to reconnect with the optimism of the golden age and did not deny a characteristic faith  going beyond the borders imposed by science  a concrete faith  since it involved the success of persevering efforts  gibarian had been influenced by classical work in bioelectronics  to which the eurasian school   cho enmin  ngyalla  kawakadze   owed its fame  these studies established an analogy between the diagram of the electrical activity of the brain and certain discharges occurring within the plasma before the appearance  for example  of elementary polymorphs or twin solarydes  gibarian rejected overly anthropomorphic interpretations  all the mystifications of the psychoanalytical  psychiatric  neurophysiological schools  which endeavored to discern in the ocean symptoms of human diseases  among others epilepsy  to which the spasmodic eruptions of asymmetriades were supposed to correspond      for among the defenders of the contact  gibarian was one of the most cautious and lucid  and he condemned sensational declarations   increasingly rare  to tell the truth  besides  my own doctoral thesis had aroused rather questionable interest  i relied on the discoveries of bergmann and reynolds  who had succeeded  in a series of very diverse processes  in isolating and  filtering  the components of the strongest emotions   despair  pain  voluptuousness  i had systematically compared these recordings with the discharges of current emitted by the ocean  i had observed oscillations and noted curves  in certain parts of the symetriads  at the base of forming mimoids  etc    revealing an analogy worthy of attention  the journalists had quickly taken hold of my name  attached by a certain press to grotesque titles   desperate gelatin  or  the planet in orgasm   this troubled fame had  however  a happy consequence  such was still my opinion a few days before   i had brought gibarian to the attention of me who  of course  could not read all of the published solarist works and he sent me a letter  with this letter  a chapter of my life ended  a new chapter was beginning
