my face and hands were burned  i remembered that while looking for a sleeping pill for    i was in no mood to laugh at my candor   i had noticed a jar of burn ointment  so i go home  i opened the door  the red twilight lit up the room  someone was sitting in the chair  beside which   had knelt  terror paralyzed me  a panic terror that urged me to flee  it only lasted a fraction of a second  the seated form lifted its head  it was    legs crossed  he still wore the same linen trousers  stained by the reagents   he consulted papers  a whole sheaf of papers lay next to him on a small table  he lowered the papers he was holding  slid his glasses down his nose and looked at me with a scowl  without a word  i approached the sink  took the pot of ointment from the pharmacy  and began to smear my forehead and cheeks with fluid ointment  fortunately  i was not too swollen and the eyes  since i had the reflex to close the eyelids  did not seem inflamed  at the temple and cheekbones  i pricked a few large blisters with a sterilized injection needle  the aseptic tampon collected serous fluid  then i applied two pieces of wet gauze to my face    watched me as long as this treatment lasted  i ignored his gaze  when i was finally done  and i was still suffering more from my burns   i sat down in the second chair  previously  i had to remove  s dress from it  a perfectly ordinary dress  but without hooks     his hands clasped around a pointed knee  continued to stare critically at me    so  we chat a little  he said  i did not answer  i was busy putting a piece of gauze back in place  which was sliding down my cheek   you had a visitor  didnt you   i answered dryly    yes  he had started the conversation in a tone that i didnt like   and you got rid of it   well  thats called being expeditious  he touched his forehead  the skin still flaking off  revealing pink surfaces of new epidermis  i was flabbergasted  why  until now  hadnt the  sunburns  of   and   oriented the course of my reflections  sunburns  but  here  nobody was exposed to the sun  without noticing the sudden glare in my eyes  he went on  i suppose you didnt immediately use drastic measures  what have you tried  narcosis  poison  freestyle wrestling   do you want to seriously discuss matters that concern us  or clown around   if you want to clown around  you can leave me  he closed his eyelids  often  we clown around in spite of ourselves  havent you tried the rope or the hammer  and the stroke of the inkwell  like luther  no   well   he grimaced   a famous fellow  the sink is whole  you havent smashed your head against the walls  you havent demolished the bedroom  one  two  ill take you on the rocket  departure  and its settled    he checked his watch    therefore  we have two or three hours    with an unpleasant smile  he added  am i odious  i nodded vigorously    disgusting    oh  what if i told you a little story  would you believe me  would you believe a single word of my story  i shut up  he continued  with his ugly smile   it happened first to    locked in his cabin  he no longer spoke to us except through the door  and us  you wonder what we thought  i kept silent  of course we thought he had gone mad  through the door he dropped something   not everything  you might be wondering why he didnt tell us there was someone at his house  oh  suum cuique  but he was a real scholar  he asked us to give him a chance    what luck   he was probably trying to solve the problem  to come to terms with it  to file it away  he worked at night  do you know what he was doing  surely you know that   these calculations  in the drawer of the radio cabin    is that him     yes    how long did it last    visit   a week or so  we thought he had hallucinations  motor problems  i gave him scopolamine   how  to him     yes  he took it  but not for himself  he tried the experiment on someone else  here is    and you     we   on the third day  we had decided to enter  to break down the door  if there was no other way  to upset his dignity and to cure him    oh yes    and then  in this cupboard       yes my boy  yes  but in the meantime we too had received visitors  we couldnt take care of him anymore  let him know what was going on  now its its become a routine  he had spoken so softly that i guessed the last words rather than heard them  i exclaimed  i dont understand  if you were listening at his door  you must have heard two voices    no  we only heard his voice  there were some weird noises we thought it was him too   only his voice   how come you didnt hear    the other one    i do not know  i do have an embryonic theory on this  i let it rest  especially since it is useless to fixate on details  but you  did you already see something yesterday  otherwise you would have taken us for crazy   i thought it was me who had gone mad   ah  and you didnt see anyone   i saw someone    who   i looked at him for a long time   his grimace no longer feigned a smile   and i replied    this     this black woman    he was leaning forward  his body relaxed imperceptibly    you could have warned me       i warned you    how    in the only way possible  i didnt know who you would see  no one could know  no one ever knows   listen     i want to ask you  you  youve known the question for some time  is she     the person who came to visit me today       you wonder if she will return  i nodded  he answered    yes and no    what does it mean    she that person will come back  ignorant of everything  just like she was at the beginning of her first visit  more accurately  she will seem unaware of what you did to get rid of her  if you follow the conditions  she wont be aggressive   what conditions    it depends on the circumstances         what    lets not waste our time secretly    in hiding      i have a feeling you havent figured it out yet   his eye glinted    good   can you tell me who came to your house  he asked abruptly  i swallowed my saliva  i lowered my head  i didnt want to watch it  i would have preferred to deal with someone else  not him  but i had no choice  a piece of gauze came off and fell on my hand  i started    a woman  who       i stopped    she killed herself  an injection       suicide    yes    thats all   he was waiting   as i was silent  he murmured    no  thats not all     i raised my head quickly  he wasnt looking at me    how do you know     he does not say anything    indeed  that is not all    i licked my lips    we argued  or rather not  its me  i got angry  you know the kind of things we say at times like this  i took my clothes and cleared off  she had let me know she hadnt said it in so many words  when youve lived with someone for years its not necessary i was sure she was talking in the air   that she wouldnt dare  that she would be afraid  and that too  i told her  the next day  i remembered that i had left these  these bulbs in the drawer  she knew them   i had brought them back from the laboratory  i needed them   i had explained to her that in high doses the action was overwhelming  i was scared  i wanted to go back and get the blisters  then i i thought that would make me look like i was taking his words seriously  on the third day  i made up my mind  i was worried  when i arrived she was dead   ah  poor innocent  i jumped  but   wasnt laughing at me  it seemed to me that i was seeing him for the first time  his face was gray  the deep wrinkles on her cheeks expressed unspeakable exhaustion  he looked like a seriously ill man  strangely intimidated  i asked   why did you say that    because your story is tragic     seeing that i was agitated  he added hastily  no  no  you still dont understand  indeed  it is a terrible burden to bear  and you may consider yourself a murderer  but  there is worse    ah really     yes  really  and im even glad you refuse to believe me  some events that have happened are horrible  but the most horrible thing is  what didnt happen  what never existed  i say  in a weak voice    what  he was shaking his head   a normal man   he said  what is a normal man  the one who has never done anything abominable  okay  but did he ever have uncontrolled thoughts  or maybe he didnt even have them  something  a fantasy  arose somewhere in him  ten or thirty years ago  something he defended himself against and forgot    and that he did not fear  because he knew that he would never let this thing flourish and that it would never lead to any action  and now imagine that suddenly  in broad daylight  he encounters this    this thought  embodied  riveted to him  indestructible  he wonders where he is   do you know where he is    where    here     whispered   in solaris station  i hesitated    what is it  after all  youre not criminals  neither you nor      he interrupted me impatiently  and you     youre a psychologist  who has never had a certain waking dream  a certain madness  think of  a maniac who falls in love  what do i know  with a piece of dirty linen   who  by dint of prayers  threats  and in defiance of the dangers  acquires this miserable beloved rag  funny story  right  a man who  at the same time  is ashamed of the object of his lust and cherishes it more than anything  a man ready to sacrifice his life for this love  because he may have feelings as strong as those of romeo for juliet    such cases exist  dont they  you understand  therefore  that there must be things   situations that no one has dared to materialize and that thought has engendered by accident  in a moment of bewilderment  dementia  call it what you will  in the next step  the idea becomes matter  here is  stunned  my throat dry  i repeated    here    my head was bursting    and the station  what relationship with the station  youre pretending not to understand  he grunted  peering at me  i keep talking about solaris  only solaris and nothing else  if reality brutally disappoints you  its not my fault  besides  after what you have already undergone  you can listen to me until the end  we take off into the cosmos  prepared for everything  that is  loneliness  struggle  fatigue and death  modesty keeps us from proclaiming it  but at times we consider ourselves admirable  however  all things considered  our eagerness turns out to be quirkiness  we dont want to conquer the cosmos  we just want to expand the earth to the frontiers of the cosmos  one planet will be arid like the sahara  another icy like our polar regions  another lush like the amazon  we are humanitarian and chivalrous  we do not want to enslave other races  we simply want to transmit our values to them and in exchange take possession of their heritage  we consider ourselves as the knights of the holy contact  this is a second lie  we are only looking for the man  we dont need other worlds  we need mirrors  we dont know what to do with other worlds  one world  our world  is enough for us  but we dont accept it as it is  we seek an ideal image of our own world  we go in search of a planet  a civilization superior to ours  but developed on the basis of the prototype of our primitive past  on the other hand  there exists in us something that we refuse  from which we defend ourselves  and which nevertheless remains  because we do not leave the earth in the state of essence of all the virtues  it is not only a statue of the man hero flying away  we pose here as we really are  and when the page turns around and reveals this reality to us   this part of our reality that we prefer to keep silent   we no longer agree  i had listened to him patiently    but what are you talking about   what we wanted  contact with another civilization  contact is established  and we can contemplate under the microscope our monstrous ugliness  our madness  our shame  his voice trembled with rage   so you think its  the ocean   that the ocean causes  that  but why   i am not yet asking how  i am asking why  do you seriously think hes trying to play games with us  or to punish us   primary demonomania  the planet dominated by an enormous devil  who satisfies the demands of his satanic humor by sending succubi to the members of a scientific expedition     you dont believe such nonsense after all  he muttered between his teeth   that devil isnt so stupid     i looked at him in bewilderment  perhaps the events   assuming that we had experienced them with a clear and sane mind   had finally shaken his nerves  reactive psychosis  he was laughing silently   are you making your diagnosis   dont rush too much  you have undergone only one ordeal and under fairly benign conditions   ah  the devil took pity on me  the conversation was beginning to tire me    what do you want  exactly  that i reveal to you what plans this mass of metamorphic plasma is planning for us   x trillion tons of metamorphic plasma  no project  perhaps    how  no project    was smiling   you should know that science deals only with phenomena  not causes  phenomenons   they started showing up eight to nine days after that x ray experience  maybe the ocean reacted to the radiation with some other radiation  maybe it probed our brains and reaches certain psychic cysts  my interest aroused    cysts    yes  psychic processes isolated from the rest  locked up  stifled  encysted   hearths smoldering under the ashes of memory  he deciphered them and used them  as one uses a recipe or a construction plan  you know how similar the asymmetric crystalline structures of the chromosome and the asymmetric crystalline structures of the deoxy acid molecule are alike   ribo nucleic entering into the composition of cerebrosides  which constitute the substrate of memory processes  this genetic material is a plasma  which remembers   so the ocean read us  it recorded the smallest details  and then  you know the rest  but why   bah   in any case  not to destroy us  he could have wiped us out much easier  apparently   given his technological means   he could have done anything  pitting your doppelganger against me  pitting you against mine  for example  i exclaimed  ah  thats why you were scared the first night when i arrived    yes  besides  he added  who told you he didnt  how do you know if im really the brave old rat who landed here two years ago  he began to laugh silently again  enjoying my embarrassment  then he growled   no  no  thats enough  we are both happy mortals     i could kill you  you could kill me       and the others  we can not kill them    i do not advise you to try   horrible sight   nothing can kill them     i do not know  in any case  no poison  no knife  no injection       the radioactive gun   would you risk it    as long as we know theyre not humans    in a sense  subjectively  theyre humans  they absolutely ignore their origin  surely you have seen it    yes  so  how is it going   they everything is regenerated with inconceivable rapidity  at an impossible speed   visibly  and they start acting like    how  as we imagine them  as they are engraved in memories  according to which    without worrying about the ointment that ran down my cheeks and dripped onto my hands  i asked abruptly    knew   you mean  knew as much as we did     yes    very probably   he said something to you     no  i found a book at his place  i jumped up   the little apocrypha     yes    he stared at me suspiciously and added  who could have told you about it  i nodded negatively    no  dont worry  you can see that my skin is burned and that it is not regenerating    had left a letter for me in his cabin    a letter   what is she saying    not much  a note rather than a letter  bibliographical references   allusions to the directory supplement and to the apocrypha  what is this apocrypha    an antique  which seems to me to have a relationship with our situation     well  he took a leather bound booklet from his pocket and handed it to me  i grabbed the little book with the worn corners   and      what      everyone manages as they can     on the other hand  strives to remain normal   that is  to preserve his respectability as an envoy on an official mission    you want to laugh   no  im not laughing  ive already been with him once  ill spare you the details  in short  there were eight of us and we only had five hundred kilos of oxygen left  one after another  we abandoned our occupations  and in the end we were a team of bearded men  he alone shaved  brushed his shoes  hes like that  now  of course  he can only pretend  act  or commit a crime    a crime     youre right  the word does not exactly fit   divorce by ejection    sounds better    very funny    if you do not like it  offer something else   ah  leave me alone     no  lets talk seriously  you know  now  about as much as i do  do you have a plan    none  i have no idea what ill do when when she comes back  if i understand correctly  she will return   thats to be expected   where do they come in   the stations envelope is hermetic  maybe the armor  he shook his head   the armor is fine  i dont know where they come in  generally  you are expected when you wake up  and yet you have to sleep from time to time   can we barricade ourselves securely inside the cabins     the barricades do not last long  theres only one way out   you guess which one  he stood up   i got up too   come on      youre suggesting that the station be liquidated and youre waiting for me to take the initiative on my own    it is not so simple  of course we can run away  if only to the satelloid  and send an sos from there we will be called crazy  of course  and we will be kept in a sanatorium on earth until we politely retract   distant planet  isolation  crisis of collective madness  our case will not seem exceptional to them  after all  even in a nursing home  we would be better off than here  a garden  calm  small white rooms  nurses  accompanied walks    hands in pockets  staring fixedly at a corner of the room  he spoke with the utmost seriousness  the red sun had disappeared on the horizon and the ocean was a dark desert  shimmering with dying gleams  the last reflections lost among the long manes of the waves  the sky was blazing  clouds with purplish fringes crossed this red and black world  unspeakably gloomy    so you want to run away  yes or no  not yet   he smiled   steadfast fighter  if you fully realized the question you raise  you wouldnt insist so much  its not about what i want  its about whats possible    what    exactly  i dont know   so were staying here   do you think well find a way  skinny  sickly  with his face peeled and furrowed with wrinkles  he faced me  perhaps its worth staying  we probably wont learn anything about him  but about us  he turned around  picked up his papers and left  i opened my mouth to hold him back  no sound passed my lips  i just had to wait  i approached the window  my eye wandered absently over the crimson shimmer of the dark ocean  i had the idea of going to lock myself in one of the space station rockets  a stupid idea that i didnt go into  sooner or later  i would have to get out of the rocket  i sat down by the window  i started leafing through the book   had given me  the fires of twilight set the room ablaze and colored the pages of the brochure  it was   compiled by a certain othon ravintzer  graduate in philosophy   a collection of articles and works of a value which  in general  could not be mistaken  all science engenders some pseudoscience  inspires a degressive approach to bizarre minds  astronomy finds its caricaturists in astrology  chemistry  formerly  found them in alchemy  it was therefore not surprising that solaristics  in its infancy  had provoked an explosion of marginal cogitations  ravintzers book gave asylum to precisely this sort of intellectual speculation  preceded   i must honestly add   by an introduction in which the author distanced himself from the texts reproduced  he considered  not without reason  that such a collection could offer a precious document of the period  both for the historian and for the scientific psychologist  bertons report   divided into two parts and supplemented by a statement from the logbook   occupied an honorable place in the brochure  from 2 00 p m  to 4 40 p m   the local time agreed by the expedition  the entries in the logbook were laconic and negative  altitude 1 000   or 1 200   or 800 meters   nothing in sight   desert ocean  the same words came up over and over  then  at 4 40 p m   a red fog rises  visibility 700 meters  desert ocean  5 pm  the fog thickens   silence   visibility 400 meters  with clearings  i get off at 200  5 20 p m   im in the fog  altitude 200  visibility 20 40 meters  i go back to 400  5 45 p m   altitude 500  sea of fog to the horizon  in the fog  funnel openings through which i see the surface of the ocean  im trying to get into one of those funnels  where something is stirring  5 52 p m   i see a kind of eddy   it throws up yellow foam  a wall of fog surrounds me  altitude 100  i descend to 20  here ended bertons logbook reading  there followed the story of his illness  or  more exactly  the deposition dictated by berton and interrupted by questions from the members of the commission   berton  when i descended to thirty meters  it became very difficult to maintain altitude  strong winds blew in this well  i had to cling to the controls and for a while ten or fifteen minutes i didnt look outside  i realized too late that a powerful whirlwind was deporting me into the fog  it was not an ordinary fog  it was a thick  colloidal material  which covered all my windows  i had trouble cleaning them  this fog   this glue   was tenacious  in addition  because of the resistance that this fog opposed to the propeller  the rotation speed was reduced by about thirty percent  and i began to lose altitude  as i had descended very low and was afraid of rolling over on the waves  i let go of the throttle completely  the aircraft maintained its altitude  but did not climb  i still had four rounds of rocket boosters left  i did not use them  i told myself that the situation was not yet hopeless  increasingly strong vibrations shook the apparatus  i thought that a layer of this glue had adhered to the propeller  but the surplus load counter always indicated zero  i did not understand anything about it  since entering the fog  i couldnt see the sun   only a red glow  i continued to move  with the hope of finally leading to one of these wells  and that was what happened  after half an hour  so i found myself in another crevasse  an almost perfect cylinder  with a diameter of a few hundred meters  the wall of the cylinder was a gigantic whirlwind of fog  which rose in a spiral  i tried to stay in the middle of the  well   where the wind was less violent  then i noticed a change in the surface of the ocean  the waves had almost completely disappeared and the upper layer of this fluid   what makes up the ocean   was becoming transparent  with cloudy streaks here and there dissipating  and in a short time everything cleared up  i could see distinctly to a depth of several meters  i saw a kind of mud  yellow silt  which projected vertical filaments  when these filaments emerged to the surface  they had a glassy luster  then they began to froth   they frothed   and then that froth froze  it looked like a very thick burnt sugar syrup  these viscous filaments became tangled and knotted  swollen protuberances grew above the ocean and little by little took on various shapes  suddenly  i noticed that my camera was deported towards the wall of fog  i had to maneuver against the wind and  when i could look down again  i saw something that reminded me of a garden  yes  a garden  trees  hedges  paths   but it wasnt a real garden  everything was made of this same substance  which had now completely hardened and looked like yellow plaster  beneath the garden  the ocean shone  i descended  as low as i could  to observe this garden closely  question  did the trees and plants you saw have leaves  bertons response  no  they were rough shapes   like a garden model  yes   a model  thats exactly what it was  a model  but life size  after a moment  the model began to burst  to break  to split black cracks  from which escaped a thick mucous liquid  which flowed or collected on the spot  the tremors increased  there was a prodigious bubbling and everything was buried under the foam  at the same time  the walls of fog tightened  i pushed the rotation speed and came out at 300 meters  question  are you absolutely sure you saw something that looked like a garden   a garden  with no other possible interpretation  answer  yes  i noticed several details  i remember  for example  that there were boxes lined up in one place  later i realized it was probably an apiary  question  did you understand later  but at the time  when did you see them  bertons answer  no  since everything was like plaster  but i saw something else  q  what  bertons response  i saw objects that i cannot give a precise name to  because i did not have time to observe them well  under some bushes  i thought i could make out tools  elongated  toothed objects  they looked like plaster casts of our little garden tools  but im not absolutely sure  while im sure   yes  im sure i recognized an apiary  question  you didnt think it was a hallucination  bertons response  no  i thought it was a mirage  i didnt think it was a hallucination  because i felt very good  and never before had i seen anything like it  when i ascended 300 meters  and looked at the fog again  there were more  irregular holes in it   imagine  if you will  a slice of cheese  some of these holes were completely hollowed out and i could see the ocean waves  others were just large buckets  where something was bubbling  i descended into one of the shafts and   the altimeter read forty   i saw a wall that lay below the surface of the ocean   but not to any great depth   the wall of a huge building  i could clearly distinguish it through the waves  it was pierced by several rows of rectangular openings  windows  it even seemed to me that i dont know what was stirring behind some of these windows  but im not entirely sure  the wall slowly straightened and emerged from the ocean  a mucous liquid  veined with compact swellings  streamed profusely and ran down the wall  suddenly  the wall broke in two  it sank into the depths of the ocean and it disappeared  i climbed back up and continued to fly above the fog  which i was almost brushing with my camera  i discovered another well  much larger than the previous one  from a distance already  i had noticed a clear shape  almost white  which floated  i had immediately thought that it was fechners spacesuit  especially since i vaguely recognized a human form  and i had rushed my turn  for fear of getting lost and not finding the place again    this form  this body was moving  sometimes he seemed to be swimming  sometimes he seemed to be standing  in the hollow of the wave  i hurried  i descended so low that my camera gently bounced   it had probably hit the crest of the big wave i was overlooking  this body   yes  it was a human body  without a diving suit   this body moved  question  did you see his face  bertons response  yes  question  who was it  bertons response  he was a child  question  which child  have you ever seen him before  bertons response  no  never  anyway  i dont remember ever seeing him  besides  when i got closer   when i got to forty meters  or even before   i saw that this was no ordinary child  question  what do you mean by that  response from berton  i will explain  i didnt immediately understand what was troubling me  i only understood after a while  this child was extraordinarily tall  huge is still an understatement  lying horizontally  his body rose  my faith  four meters above the ocean  i remember that when i hit the wave his face was a little higher than mine  and yet  in my cabin  i must have overlooked the ocean by at least ten feet  question  if he was so big  why do you say he was a child  bertons response  because he was a very small child  question  dont you realize  berton  that your answer lacks logic  bertons response  no  absolutely not  i saw his face  he was a very young child  moreover  the proportions of the body corresponded exactly to the proportions of the body of a child  it was a  an infant  no  im exaggerating  he was maybe two or three years old  he had black hair and huge blue eyes  he was naked  completely naked   like a newborn baby  it was wet  or rather vitrified  her skin was glistening  i was terribly upset  i no longer believed in a mirage  i saw this child so distinctly  it rose and fell  following the movement of the wave  but  independently of this general movement of the body  it moved  it was horrible  question  why  what was he doing   bertons response  it looked like a museum doll  but a living doll  he opened and closed his lips  he made different gestures  horrible gestures  yes  because they werent his own gestures  question  what do you mean by that  bertons response  i was looking at him from twenty meters away   i guess i didnt get any closer  but  i told you  it was huge  i saw it very clearly  his eyes were shining  and you really would have thought he was a living child  if it hadnt been for those movements  those gestures that someone seemed to be trying  it looked like someone else was s practiced performing these gestures  question  try to clarify your thoughts  bertons response  its difficult  im talking about an impression  an intuition  i wasnt thinking  but i knew these gestures werent natural  question  do you hear  for example  that the hands did not move as human hands can move  because of the limited flexibility of the joints  bertons response  no  absolutely not  but these movements made no sense  each of our movements means more or less something  serves a purpose  question  do you believe  the movements of an infant have little meaning  bertons response  i know  but the movements of an infant are disordered  confused  muddled  the movements i observed  ah    yes  thats it   they were methodical movements  they were accomplished successively  grouped by series  as if someone had wanted to study what the child was capable of doing with his hands  his torso  his mouth  the face was more terrible than the rest  because the face has an expression  and that face  i dont know how to put it  he was alive  yes  but not human  or rather  the features  as a whole  yes  the eyes  and the complexion  but the expression  the movements of the face  no  question  were those grimaces  do you know what happens to a mans face during an epileptic fit  bertons response  yes  i witnessed an epileptic seizure  i understand  no  it was something different  epilepsy causes spasms  convulsions  the movements i am telling you about were fluid  continuous  graceful   melodious  if one can call it a movement  this is the most precise definition  but this face  a face cannot be split in two   half happy  half sad  half threatening and half kind  half fearful and half triumphant  with this child  it was like that  in addition  all the movements and the changes of expression succeeded each other with inconceivable rapidity  i spent very little time down there  maybe ten seconds  maybe less than ten seconds  question  and you claim to have seen all this in such a short time  besides  how do you know how long you stayed  did you check your stopwatch  bertons response  no  i havent checked my stopwatch  but ive been flying for sixteen years  in my job  we instinctively measure the duration of what we call an instant  to the nearest second  it is a faculty that one acquires and which is essential to navigate properly  a pilot will never be worth much who does not know  regardless of the circumstances  whether a phenomenon lasts five or ten seconds  the same goes for observation  we learn  over the years  to see everything in the shortest possible time  question  is that all you saw  bertons response  no  but i dont remember the rest so exactly  i guess id seen too much already   my attention slipped  the fog was starting to tighten around me and i had to climb back up  i came back up   for the first time in my life  i almost flipped over  my hands were shaking so badly  i had trouble holding the controls  i think i shouted something  called the base   though i knew we werent radioed  question   did you try to come back then  bertons response  no  eventually  when i got to the top  i thought maybe fechner was at the bottom of one of those holes  i know that might sound crazy  but thats what i thought  i said to myself that anything was possible  and that it would also be possible for me to find fechner  i decided to go down in all the holes that i will meet on my way  on my third attempt  i gave up  when i went back up  i understood that it was useless to insist  after what i had just seen  this third time  i couldnt go on anymore  i must add   the fact is already known   that i suffered from nausea and vomited in my cabin  i didnt understand anything about it  i had never had any discomfort  note  it was a symptom of intoxication  berton  bertons response  maybe  i do not know  but what i saw this third time  i did not imagine it  it is not the effect of an intoxication  question  how can you know that  bertons response  it was not a hallucination  a hallucination is created by my own brain  right  note  yes  bertons response  well  my brain couldnt have created what i saw  i will never believe it  my brain wouldnt have been able to  note  tell what it was instead  response from berton  first  i would like to know how the statements i have already made will be interpreted  question  what does it matter  response from berton  for me  of paramount importance  i said i saw things i will never forget  if the commission recognizes  even with reservations  that my testimony is credible  and that the ocean should be studied   i mean  by directing the research according to my statements   then i will say everything  but  if the commission considers that it is a question of delirium  i will say nothing more  question  why  bertons response  because the content of my hallucinations belongs to me and i dont have to account for them  on the other hand  i must report what i observed on solaris  question  does this mean that you refuse to answer any further questions until the competent expedition office has pronounced its decision  do you understand  it goes without saying that the commission is not empowered to take an immediate decision  bertons response  yes  here ended the first report  there followed a fragment of the second report  drawn up eleven days later   the president    after deliberation  the commission   made up of three doctors  three biologists  a physicist  a mechanical engineer and the deputy head of the expedition   came to the conclusion that the report of berton presents a hallucinatory syndrome of intoxication by the atmosphere of the planet  a characterized morbid syndrome  following an irritation of the associative zone of the cerebral cortex  and which bertons account does not reflect any part  or at least no part appreciable  of reality  berton  excuse me  what does  no part  or at least no appreciable part  mean  in what proportions is reality appreciable or not  the chairman  i have not finished  independently of these conclusions  the commission duly registered a votum separatum of mr  archibald messenger  doctor in physics  who considers objectively possible the phenomena described by berton and declares himself favorable to a scrupulous verification  thats all  berton  i repeat my question  the chairman  the answer is simple   no appreciable part  means that phenomena actually observed may have served as support for your hallucinations  during a nocturnal walk  a perfectly sane man thinks he recognizes a living being in a bush blowing in the wind  with all the more reason  what will not be the illusions of the explorer  lost on a foreign planet and exposed to breathing a toxic atmosphere  this judgment does not harm you  berton  would you be kind enough now to inform us of your decision  berton  i would first like to know the consequences of this votum separatum of dr  messenger  the chair  virtually nil  we will continue the work along the line originally established  berton  is our interview recorded  the chairman  yes  berton  so i want to say that the commission does not harm me  but the very spirit of the expedition  therefore  as i have already stated  i will not answer any further questions  the chairman  thats it  berton  yes  but i want to meet dr  messenger  is it possible   the chair  of course  here ended the second report  at the bottom of the page was a note in lower case  the next day dr  messenger had spoken for nearly three hours with berton  following this conversation  messenger had again asked the board of the expedition to undertake research  in order to verify the declarations of the pilot  this had revealed new  extremely convincing facts   which messenger could not divulge until the council had taken a positive decision  the council   shannahan  timolis and trahier   rejected the motion and the matter was dismissed  the book still reproduced the photocopy of the last page of a letter   the draft of a letter    page found by the executor  after the death of messenger  ravintzer  despite his research  did not know if this letter had ever been sent     obtuse minds  pyramid of foolishness    thus began the text     for the sake of preserving its authority  the council   specifically shannahan and timolis  betrayers voice does not count    rejected my recommendations  now  i address myself directly to the institute  but  you can easily imagine  my protests wont convince anyone  bound by oath  i cannot  unfortunately  tell you what berton told me  if the council disregarded bertons testimony  it is mainly because berton has no scientific training   while any scientist could envy this pilots presence of mind and gift of observation  please send me the following information by return mail  1  biography of fechner  including details of his childhood  2  everything you know about his family  facts and dates   he probably lost his parents when he was a child  3  topography of the locality where he was raised  i would still like to tell you what i think of all this  as you know  some time after fechner and carucci left  a spot appeared in the center of the red sun  this chromospheric eruption projected a shower of energetic particles mainly   according to the information provided by the satelloid   towards the southern hemisphere  where our base was located  and the radio link was interrupted  while the other teams explored the planets surface in a relatively small radius  fechner and carucci moved considerably away from base  never  since our arrival on the planet and until this day of misfortune  had we observed such constant fog  nor such silence  i assume berton saw some phases of  operation man  undertaken by this slimy monster  at the origin of all the forms seen by berton  there is fechner   or rather his brain  subjected to an inconceivable  psychic dissection   for a recreation  an experimental reconstruction  from imprints  among the most durable  certainly  engraved in his memory  i know that sounds fantastic  i know i could be wrong  please help me  i am currently on the alaric  where i will await your response  yours  4   it was dark  i struggled to read the printed characters  which faded to the top of the gray page   the last page of pilot bertons adventure  my own experience led me to regard berton as a reliable witness  i turned to the window  my gaze plunged into a purple abyss  a few clouds still gleamed with a faint glow of embers above the horizon  i couldnt see the ocean  covered in shadow  the ribbons of paper waved lazily under the grilles of the fans  the warm air  still and silent  had a slight taste of ozone  there was nothing heroic about our decision to stay on the station  the time of heroes was over  the time of great interplanetary victories  the time of daring expeditions  the time of sacrifices   fechner  the first victim of the ocean  belonged to the distant past  i hardly cared anymore who was the  visitor  of   or    soon  i told myself  we will stop being ashamed  of isolating ourselves  if we cannot get rid of our  visitors   we will get used to their company  we will live with them  if their creator changes the rules of the game  we will adapt to these new rules  even if we begin to balk  to revolt   even if one of us gives in to discouragement and kills himself  eventually  some balance will be restored  night had come  like so many nights on earth  i could only make out the white contours of the sink and the smooth surface of the mirror  i got up  i groped my way through the objects cluttering the sink shelf  i found the box of cotton wool  i washed my face with a damp swab and went to lie down on the bed  a moth flapped its wings   no  it was the ribbon from the fan  the buzzing ceased  resumed  i could no longer see the window  everything was confused in the darkness  a ray of light  falling from i dont know where  crossed the space and lingered in front of me   on the wall  or on the black sky  i remembered how the empty stare of the night had frightened me the night before  i smile at my fear  i was no longer afraid of that look  i feared nothing  i lifted my wrist and looked at the crown of phosphorescent numerals  another hour and it would be the dawn of the blue day  i breathed deeply  i savored the darkness  i was empty  free from all thoughts  as i moved  i felt the flat shape of the tape recorder against my hip     his voice immortalized by spools of thread  i had forgotten to resurrect him  to listen to him   the only thing i could do for him now  i took the tape recorder out of my pocket to hide it under the bed  i heard a rustle and the door opened         a worried voice whispered my name      are you there   its so dark     i replied    im here  do not be afraid  come
