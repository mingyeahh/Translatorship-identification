Hastily pocketing Gibarians notes  I approached the closet  coveralls and other clothing had been pushed aside  squeezed aside  as if a man had taken refuge in the back of the closet  From the avalanche of papers on the floor emerged the corner of an envelope  I picked it up  It was addressed to me  My throat dry  I tore open the envelope  I had to make an effort to decide to unfold the sheet it contained  In his regular  perfectly legible  though very small  handwriting  Gibarian had drawn two lines  Supplement Ann  Solar  Vol 1   Vote  Separation  Messenger ds aff  F   Ravintzer  Little Apocrypha  That was all  not another word  Did these two lines contain important information  When had he written them  I told myself that I had to consult the files of the library as soon as possible  I was familiar with the supplement to the first volume of the Yearbook of Solarist Studies  that is to say  without having read it  I was aware of its existence   didnt it have the value of a purely historical document  As for Ravintzer and his Petit Apocryphe  I had never heard of them  What to do   I was already almost a quarter of an hour late  Once again  with my back to the door  I searched the room attentively  Only then did I notice the bed  standing vertically against the wall and concealed by a large map of Solaris  Something was hanging behind the map   a pocket tape recorder  The reel had been recorded at nine tenths  I took the device out of its case  hung it up where I had found it  and slipped the tape recorder into my pocket  I returned to the door  eyes closed  I listened for outside noises  Nothing  I opened the door into a black chasm and finally had the sense to take off my glasses  the luminous filaments  under the ceiling  sparingly lighted the rotunda  Divided between the four doors of the living quarters and the passage leading to the radio cabin  a multitude of corridors spun off in a star shape in all directions  Suddenly  emerging from a recess that led to the common bathroom  a tall figure appeared  barely distinguishable  confused with the half light  I stopped  riveted to the ground  A giant woman  of the Negroid type  was advancing quietly  waddling  I glimpsed the sparkle of the white of his eye and heard the soft tapping of his bare feet  She was dressed only in a yellow skirt  of plaited straw  her huge breasts swayed freely and her black arms were as big as thighs  She passed me   a distance of barely a meter separated us   without giving me the slightest glance  Her straw skirt swinging rhythmically  she continued on her way  like those Stone Age steatopygous statues you see in anthropology museums  She opened Gibarians door  Her silhouette stood out clearly in the doorway  surrounded by the brighter light that had come on inside the room  Then she closed the door  I was alone  With my right hand  I grabbed my left hand  which I squeezed with all my strength  until the joints cracked  I stared blankly at the large  empty room  What had happened  What was that   Suddenly I swayed  I remembered Snauts warnings  What did that mean  Who was this monstrous Aphrodite  I took a step  a single step  in the direction of Gibarians cabin  I knew very well that I would not enter  Nostrils wide apart  I sucked in the air  Why   Oh yes   Instinctively  I had waited for the characteristic smell of his sweat  but I hadnt felt anything  not even when we were only a step away from each other  I dont know how long I stood leaning against the cool metal wall  hearing nothing but the distant  monotonous sound of air conditioners  I lightly slapped both my cheeks and headed for the radio booth  When I pressed the handle  I heard a harsh voice    Whos there    Its me  Kelvin  Snaut sat at a table set between a heap of aluminum boxes and the transmitter  he ate meat concentrate  which he drew directly from the tin can  Did he no longer leave the radio booth  Bewildered  I looked at him playing with his jaws  then I realized that I myself was starving  I approached the cupboards  chose the least dusty plate and sat down opposite Snaut  We ate in silence  Snaut stood up  uncorked an insulated bottle  and filled two goblets with hot broth  Putting the bottle back on the floor   there was no room on the table   he asked me  Have you seen Sartorius   No  where is he     Up  Upstairs was the laboratory  We continued to eat  without saying anything more  Snaut dutifully scraped the bottom of his box  Four globes  fixed to the ceiling  lighted the room  an airtight shutter closed the window to the outside  The reflections of the luminous globes vibrated on the plastic cover of the transmitter  Snaut was now wearing a flowing black sweater  which frayed at the cuffs  Red veins marbled the taut skin of her cheekbones  He asked me    What is it    Nothing  why     Youre all swimming  I wiped my forehead  It was true  I was streaming  the reaction  surely  after an unexpected encounter  Snaut looked at me quizzically  Should I tell him  If he had shown me more confidence  What incomprehensible game we were playing here  and who was the adversary of whom    Its hot  I thought the air conditioning in your house worked better than that    The devices adjust themselves automatically every hour    His gaze became insistent  Are you sure its just the heat  I did not answer  Snaut tossed the utensils and empty cans into the sink  He returned to his chair and continued to question me    What are your intentions  I replied phlegmatically    It depends on you  I assume you have a research plan  right  A new stimulus  probably X rays  or something like that  He frowned   X rays  who told you about it    I do not remember  Someone touched me a word about it  Maybe on the Prometheus  So  have you started   I dont know the details  It was Gibarians idea  He prepared this with Sartorius  I wonder how you can know  I shrugged    You are not aware of the details  You should  since its you  I didnt finish my sentence  Snaut was silent  The yapping of the air conditioners had ceased  The temperature remained at a bearable level  In the air lingered a nasal sound  like the buzzing of a dying fly  Snaut rose from his chair and leaned over the transmitter control panel  he began to maneuver the levers  without order and without result  for he had left the ignition switch in neutral  He amused himself thus for a moment  then he remarked  Well have to complete the formalities concerning  I could only see his back  I say yes   He turned around and glared at me  I hadnt specifically sought to infuriate him  but  ignoring the game that was being played  I forced myself to expectation full of reserve  Adams apple jutted out from the neckline of his sweater  You went to Gibarians  he said suddenly   and that wasnt a question  I looked at him peacefully  He repeated   You went to his house   I sketched a movement of the head   If you insist     He asked    Was someone there  So he had seen her   at least he knew of her existence   Nobody  who could I have found there    Then why didnt you let me in   I smile    Because I was afraid  I remembered your warnings  When the handle moved  I held it back mechanically  Why didnt you tell me it was you  I would have let you in  In an unsteady voice  he answered  I thought it was Sartorius    So what   To my question  he replied again with another question    What do you think     what happened there  I hesitated    You must know better than me     where is he    In the cold room  We transported him right away this morning   Where did you find it     In the closet    In the closet   Was he already dead    The heart was still beating  but it was not breathing  It was the end   Have you tried to revive him     No    Why   He stammered  I havent had time  When I laid him down  he was dead   He was standing in the closet   In the middle of these combinations    Yes  Snaut took a sheet of paper from the corner desk and handed it to me   I wrote up a provisional report  After all  Im glad you saw the room  Cause of death  pernostal injection  lethal dose  Its written there  I scanned the sheet of paper with my eyes and murmured    Suicide  whats the reason    Nervous disorders  depression  call it what you want     you know better than me  I remained seated  Snaut stood before me  Intercepting his gaze  I replied    I only know what I saw myself  He asked quietly   What do you mean   He shot himself on the pernostal and hid in the cupboard  yes  In this case  it is not nervous disorders or an attack of depression  but a very serious condition  a paranoid psychosis    Speaking more and more slowly and not taking her eyes off him  I added  He certainly had the impression of seeing something  Snaut resumed playing with the transmitters joysticks  After a moment of silence  I resumed   Here is your signature   and Sartoriuss   Hes in the lab  I already told you  He doesnt show up  I suppose he    That he    That he locked himself away   That he locked himself away   Ah  hes locked himself in  Maybe hes barricaded himself    Its possible   Snaut  theres someone in the Station  someone else  He had let go of the levers and was looking at me  his torso tilted to the side    You saw   You warned me  Against who   Against what   A hallucination    What you saw     A human   He was silent  He had turned against the wall  as if to hide his face from me  His fingertips tapped the metal plating  I examined his hands  There was no trace of blood on the joints  I had a brief glare  In a low voice  almost a breath  as if I had entrusted him with a secret that no one should hear  I said    It is not a mirage  but a real being  that we can     touch   that we can  hurt  and that you saw just today    How do you know   Glued facing the wall  he hadnt moved  my words hit him in the back    Before my arrival     very shortly before my arrival  is not it  He contracted  I saw his distraught gaze    And you     He choked    And you  who are you   I thought he was going to rush at me  I had not expected such a reaction  The situation was becoming absurd  He didnt believe I was who I claimed to be  What did that mean  He looked at me with increasing terror  He was delirious  Had the mephitic emanations from the outside atmosphere intoxicated him  Everything was possible  Yes  and I  I had seen her  this creature  so  me too  I asked   Who is it   These words calmed him down  For a moment he looked at me with an inquisitive eye  as if he still doubted me  He sat down limply in his chair and put his head in his hands  even before he had opened his mouth  I had understood that he was not resolved to answer me directly   Fever   he said softly  I asked again   Who is it   He growled   If you dont know    Then what     Nothing    Snaut  We are isolated  far from everything  Lets put our cards on the table  Things are confusing enough    What do you want    Tell me who you saw    And you   he asked suspiciously    Well  Ill answer you and then you answer me  Dont worry  I wont think youre crazy    Crazy  Good Lord     He tried to smile    But you didnt understand anything  absolutely nothing  If for a single moment he could have thought he was delirious  he wouldnt have done that  he would be alive  So your report  this story of nervous disorders  is it a lie    Obviously    Why not write the truth   He repeated   Why   A long silence followed  No  decidedly  I did not understand anything  I thought I had convinced him of my sincerity  I had imagined that we were going to combine our efforts to solve the enigma  Why  why did he refuse to speak   Where are the robots     In warehouses  We locked them all away  We only left the reception staff in place    Why   Again he refused to answer    You do not want to talk     I can not  Constantly he seemed on the point of giving up  then he slipped away  I might as well go up to Sartorius  I remembered the letter and  at that moment  I gave it capital importance   Do you plan to continue the experiments   He shook his shoulders disdainfully    Ah     so what are we going to do  He was silent  We heard  in the distance  a faint sound of footsteps  bare feet hitting the ground  Among the nickel plated and plastic coated instruments  among the high casings furrowed with glass tubes and containing the complicated equipment of the electronic installations  the muffled echo of this shuffling gait resounded in a grotesque and unreal way  Unable to control myself  I stood up  I listened to the footsteps approaching and watched Snaut  Eyelids half lowered  he didnt look frightened  Wasnt he afraid of her  I asked   Where does she come from     And as he was slow to answer  You dont want to tell me    I do not know    Good  The sound of footsteps receded and died    You do not believe me   he said  I swear I dont know  In silence  I opened the closet that contained the diving suits and I pushed aside the heavy tracksuits  At the bottom  as I had expected  hung the gas guns that we used to move in the void  I picked up a pistol  checked it was loaded  and slipped the scabbard strap over my shoulder  It wasnt a weapon per se  but it was better than nothing  As I was adjusting the length of the sling  Snaut smiled quizzically  baring his yellow teeth   Happy hunting   he said  I walked towards the door    Thank you  He tore himself from his chair   Kelvin  I looked at him  He was no longer smiling  I had never seen a face expressing so much weariness  He stammered   Kelvin  its not I really  I cant   I waited  he moved his lips without uttering a sound  I turned around and got out
