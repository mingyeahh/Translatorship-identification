after six days  no reaction having occurred  we decided to repeat the experiment  immobilized until then at the intersection of the forty third parallel and the one hundred and sixteenth meridian  the station moved south  hovering at a constant altitude of four hundred meters above the ocean  our radars  indeed  as well as the radiograms of the satelloid  signaled a resurgence of plasma activity in the southern hemisphere  for forty eight hours  an invisible beam of x rays modulated by my encephalogram struck  at regular intervals  the almost smooth surface of the ocean  at the end of these forty eight hours of travel  we had reached the outskirts of the polar region  the disc of the blue sun descended on one side of the horizon  and already on the opposite side the purple bulges of the clouds announced the red sunrise  in the sky  blinding flames  sheaves of green sparks struggled with muffled purple lights  the ocean itself took part in this combat of two stars  of two balls of fire  set ablaze here with mercurial reflections and there with scarlet reflections  the smallest cloud passing in the firmament enriched with iridescent shimmers the brilliance of the foam on the slope of the waves  the blue sun had just disappeared when  at the edge of the sky and the ocean  there suddenly appeared  barely distinct  drowned in the bloody mists   but immediately signaled by the detectors   a gigantic glass flower  a symmetry  the station did not alter its course  after a quarter of an hour  the colossal ruby quivering with dying gleams was again concealed behind the horizon  a few minutes later  a thin column  whose base remained hidden from our eyes by the curvature of the planet  rose a few thousand meters into the atmosphere  this fantastic tree which continued to grow  dripping with blood and mercury  signified the end of symmetry  the proliferation of branches  at the top of the column  melted into an enormous mushroom simultaneously lit by the two suns and which flew away with the wind  the lower part  swollen  decomposed in heavy clusters and sank slowly  the agony of symmetry lasted a full hour  another forty eight hours passed  our rays had swept across a wide expanse of ocean  one last time  we repeated the experiment  from our vantage point we could distinctly see  three hundred kilometers to the south  a chain of arrhenids  six rocky summits  covered with a material like snow  in reality  they were deposits of organic origin  proving that this mountainous formation had once been the bottom of the ocean  we then headed southwest  for some time we skirted the mountain range  crowned with the clouds that gathered during the red day  then the clouds disappeared  ten days had passed since the first experiment  in the station  apparently  not much was going on    had set the program for the experiment  which an automatic installation repeated at fixed intervals   i didnt even know if anyone was checking the correct operation of the installation  in reality  the calm was not as complete as it seemed   but not due to human activities  i feared that   intended to finish building the annihilator  and how would   react  when he learned that i had deceived him to some extent  that i had exaggerated the dangers to which one exposed oneself in attempting to annihilate neutrinic matter  neither of them  however  spoke to me about this project anymore and i wondered about the reasons for their silence  i vaguely suspected them of cunning and concealment   perhaps they had undertaken work in secret  every day i would peek into the room where the annihilator was located  a windowless room located directly below the main lab  i never met anyone in that room  the layer of dust covering the frame and the cables of the apparatus testified that one had not touched this one for weeks  besides  i didnt meet anyone anywhere and i couldnt reach   anymore  when i tried to call the radio booth  no one answered the phone  someone must have been directing the stations movements  but who  i didnt know and  strange as it may seem  i considered that the question did not concern me  the absence of reactions from the ocean also left me indifferent  so much so that  after two or three days  i had ceased to hope for them or to apprehend them  i had completely forgotten about the experience and the possible reactions  i remained seated for whole days  either in the library or in my cabin     a discreet shadow  kept me company  i felt that a malaise remained between us and that my apathy  this state of respite outside of thought  could not stretch to infinity  obviously  it was up to me to take the initiative  it was up to me to change our relationship  but i rejected the very idea of any change whatsoever  i was unable to make any decision  i had the feeling that everything inside the station  and in particular my relationship with    had the fragility of an unstable scaffolding   that the slightest modification could upset this perilous balance and precipitate ruin  where did this feeling come from  i didnt know  the strangest thing is that she  too  somehow had a similar feeling  when  today  i relive these moments  i am convinced that this feeling of uncertainty  of respite  this presentiment of an imminent cataclysm were caused by an invisible presence  which had taken possession of the station  presence which i think i can affirm was also manifested in dreams  having never had such visions before or since  i decided to write them down  to transcribe them approximately  insofar as my vocabulary allows me to relate them  it being understood that it is not there are only fragmentary glimpses  almost entirely stripped of an intransmissible horror  in an indistinct region  in the heart of immensity  far from heaven and earth  no ground under my feet  no vault above my head  no walls  nothing  i am a prisoner of a foreign matter  my body is coated with a dead  formless substance  or rather  i no longer have a body  i am this matter foreign to myself  nebulous spots  of a pale pink  surround me  suspended in a medium more opaque than the air  for the objects become distinct only when they are very close to me  but then  when the objects come closer  they have an extraordinary clearness  they impose themselves on me with a supernatural precision  the reality of everything around me now has an incomparable power of material evidence   as i wake up  i have the paradoxical feeling that this is the waking state ive just left  and everything i see after i open my eyes seems hazy and unreal   so begins the dream   something around me awaits my consent  my agreement  an inner acquiescence  and i know  or rather something within me knows that i should not give in to an unknown temptation  for the more promising the silence seems  the more terrible will be the end  or  more exactly  i dont know any such thing  because if i knew  i would be afraid  and i never felt any fear  i wait  from the pink mist that envelops me  an invisible object emerges and touches me  inert  imprisoned in this foreign matter that surrounds me  i can neither step back nor turn around  and this invisible object continues to touch me  to examine my prison  and i feel this contact like that of a hand  and this hand recreates me  until now  i thought i saw  but i had no eyes  and now i have eyes  under the fingers caressing me with a hesitant movement  my lips  my cheeks come out of nothingness  and the caress extending  i have a face  the breath swells my chest  i exist  and recreated  i create in my turn  and before me appears a face that i have never seen before  both unknown and known  i try to meet the eyes in front of me  but that is impossible for me  because i cannot impose any direction on my gaze  and we mutually discover each other  beyond all will  in a collected silence  i came alive again  i feel unlimited strength and this creature   a woman    stay with me  and we remain motionless  our hearts beat  confused  and suddenly from the void that surrounds us  where nothing exists and can exist  an  influence  of indefinable  inconceivable cruelty insinuates itself  the caress which created us  which enveloped us in a golden mantle  becomes the tingling of an infinity of fingers  our bodies  white and naked  dissolve  turn into a swarm of black vermin  and i am   we are   a mass of sticky  intertwined worms  an endless  infinite mass  and in this infinity  no  i am infinity  and i scream silently  i crave death  i crave an end  but  simultaneously  i scatter in all directions  and the pain swells in me  a pain more acute than any pain experienced in the waking state  a pain multiplied  a sword searching the black and red distances   a rock hard and growing pain  a mountain of pain visible in the bright light of another world  this is one of the simplest dreams  i cannot relate the others  for lack of words to express their horror  in these dreams  i was unaware of  s existence  nor could i find any trace of recent or ancient events  there were also dreams without  images   in a motionless darkness  a  coagulated  shadow  i feel that someone is auscultating me  slowly  minutely  but no instrument  no hand touches me  yet i feel penetrated through and through  i crumble  i disintegrate  there is only emptiness  and total annihilation is followed by a terror  the mere memory of which is enough today to precipitate the beats of my heart  and the days followed one another  dull  always similar  i was indifferent to everything  i feared only the night and i did not know how to escape the dreams    never slept  stretched out beside her  i fled from sleep  i held her in my arms  i kissed her  i cajoled her  tenderness was only a pretext  a means of postponing the moment when i would fall asleep  i had not spoken to   about these horrible nightmares  but she must have guessed something  because her attitude betrayed an involuntary feeling of deep humiliation  as i said  i had not seen   or   for a long time     however  occasionally gave me signs of life  he left a ticket at my door  or called me by telephone  he then asked me if i had noticed any new phenomenon  any change  anything that could be interpreted as a reaction to the experience repeated so many times  i answered him negatively and returned the question to him  at the back of the small screen    was just shaking his head  on the fifteenth day after the experiments stopped  i woke up earlier than usual  the nightmare of the night had exhausted me and i felt a numbness in all my limbs  as if i had remained for long hours under the effect of a powerful narcosis  the first rays of the red sun illuminated the window  a river of purple flames flowed over the surface of the ocean and i noticed that this immense expanse  which no movement had disturbed the previous days  was beginning to stir  and suddenly a thin veil of mist covered the black ocean  but this pale haze seemed to have a very palpable consistency  here and there a tremor shook the mist  then  gradually  the vibration spread in all directions to the horizon  the black ocean then disappeared completely beneath thick rolling membranes  with rosy bulges and depressions of pearly shadow  these strange waves  suspended above the ocean  suddenly merged into a tumult and there was nothing more than a mass of glaucous foam with large bubbles  which a storm raised furiously up to the height of the station   and all around immense membranous wings  without any resemblance to clouds  soared into the red sky  some of these wings of foam  which completely veiled the sun  seemed carbonaceous  others  exposed at an angle to the light  had cherry or amaranth shades  and the phenomenon continued  as if the ocean were in the process of shedding  throwing off an old scaly skin  at times the black surface of the ocean gleamed in an opening  immediately covered with foam  wings of foam hovered close to me  a few yards from the window  one of them  a silky scarf  rubbed the window  and  while the ocean continued to spawn these bizarre birds  the first swarms dissipated high in the sky and broke up at the zenith into transparent filaments  the station remained immobilized as long as the spectacle lasted  approximately three hours  that is to say until nightfall  and even after the sun was gone  when the shadows already covered the ocean  you could still see myriads of jagged wings glowing red  sinking into the sky  hovering in serried ranks  climbing effortlessly  sucked up towards the firmament   the phenomenon had appalled    but it was no less disconcerting to me  its novelty should not have disturbed me  since the solarists observed two or three times a year   and even more often  when luck favored them   forms and creations that no repertoire had previously described  the following night  an hour before the blue sunrise  we witnessed another phenomenon  the ocean was becoming phosphorescent  patches of gray light swayed to the rhythm of the invisible waves  these spots  at first isolated  quickly spread out  joined together  and soon a carpet of spectral light spread out as far as the eye could see  the intensity of the light gradually increased for about fifteen minutes  then the phenomenon ended surprisingly  from the west came a blanket of shadow  advancing a breadth of several hundred miles  when this moving shadow had passed the station  the phosphorescent part of the ocean  receding towards the east  seemed to flee from the gigantic extinguisher  it was like a routed dawn  pushed back to the horizon  surrounded by a final halo  and the night triumphed  a little later  the sun rose above the desert ocean  rippled by a few frozen waves  whose mercurial reflections came to hit my window  the phosphorescence of the ocean was a listed phenomenon  which was sometimes observed before the eruption of an asymmetry  and which in any case meant a local amplification of the activity of the plasma  however  for the next two weeks  nothing happened either outside or inside the station  once  however  in the middle of the night  i heard a powerful cry  a superhuman cry  sharp and prolonged  awakened from a nightmare  i first thought that another dream had succeeded the previous one  before falling asleep  i had heard muffled noises coming from the laboratory  part of which was located above my cabin  it seemed to me that we were moving heavy objects  large appliances  and when i knew that i was not dreaming  i judged that this cry also came from above  but how could such a shrill cry pierce a soundproof ceiling  the excruciating howl lasted almost half an hour  dripping with sweat  my nerves raw  i was about to make up my mind to go upstairs  when the cry stopped  and again i heard the muffled  distant sliding of heavy objects dragged along the ground  two days later  while i was having dinner with      walked into the small kitchen  he had dressed  as one dresses on earth after a days work  and this new costume changed him  he looked taller  and also older  without looking at us  he approached the table  he did not sit down  opened a can of meat and began to eat  swallowing a mouthful of bread between two mouthfuls of cold meat  the sleeve of his jacket brushed the edge of the box and was stained with grease  i said to him    watch out for your sleeve  mouth full  he growled   huh  then he continued to gulp down the food  as if he hadnt eaten anything in days  he filled a glass of wine  emptied it in one gulp  sighed and rubbed his lips  with his bloodshot eyes  he looked at me and muttered   you dont shave anymore  ah  ah    piled the dishes in the sink    rocked on his heels  he grimaced and sucked noisily on his teeth  i had the impression that he exaggerated this noise for pleasure  he looked at me insistently    have you decided not to shave    i did not answer    believe me  he added  you are wrong  he  too  had begun by not shaving       go to bed    what   i want to chat a little  listen     maybe he wants us well  he might want to please us  but he doesnt know exactly how to go about it  it deciphers desires in our brains  and only two percent of nervous processes are conscious  therefore  he knows us better than we know ourselves  you have to get along with him  you listen to me   you do not want   why   he was tearing   why dont you shave    shut up      youre drunk   drunk  me   so what   because i drag my hump from one end of space to the other and i snoop around the cosmos  am i not allowed to get drunk  why   you believe in the mission of man  huh       told me about you  before letting his beard grow  he described you very well  above all  dont go into the laboratory  you would lose faith there  the laboratory is the domain of    our reverse faust1  he is looking for a remedy against immortality  hes the last knight of the holy contact  the man we need  his most recent find  too  wasnt bad   prolonged agony  not bad huh   agonia perpetuated straw straw hats and you dont drink     he lifted his swollen eyelids and looked at    motionless  she stood leaning against the wall    began to declaim   o  white aphrodite  born of the ocean  your divine hand     he choked out laughing   it sticks  huh  kel wine   a fit of coughing prevented him from continuing  calm  with a cold rage  i gritted  shut up  shut up and go   are you chasing me   you also   you dont shave anymore and you chase me away  you dont want my warnings anymore  you dont want my advice anymore  between interstellar companions  it takes 1 in french in the text  help each other  look     were going down  open the windows  and were going to call him  he may hear us  but what is his name  we have given a name to all the stars  to all the planets  when perhaps they already had a name  what nerve on our part  come on  lets go down  were going to shout  well explain to him the trick hes played on us so well  that hell be very moved    hell build us silver symetriads  hell raise his mathematical prayers to us  hell send us angels the color of blood  he will share our sorrows and our terrors  and he will beg us to help him die  he is already begging us  he is imploring us  by each of his manifestations  he is begging us to help him die  arent you smiling  but you know im kidding  if the man had a more pronounced sense of humor  things might have turned out differently  do you know what he wants to do  he wants to punish this ocean  he wants to make it howl from all its mountains at once    do you think he wont have the courage to submit his plan to the ossified areopagus who sent us here    as redeemers of sins that are foreign to us  youre right  hes scared  but hes only afraid of the little hat  he wont show the little hat to anyone  he wont have the courage  our faust  i was silent    swayed more and more violently  tears streamed down her cheeks and fell onto her clothes  he continued   who is responsible   who is responsible for this situation     giese  einstein  plato  all criminals    just think  in a rocket  man risks bursting like a bubble  or becoming petrified  or burning out  or sweating all his blood in one go  without having had time to shout  and all that remains are the ossicles which whirl between the armored walls  according to newtons laws corrected by einstein  these rattles of our progress  with a good heart  we followed the superb road  and here we are arrived  contemplate our success     contemplate our cells  these unbreakable plates  these immortal sinks  this cohort of faithful cupboards  these dedicated cupboards  if i wasnt drunk  i wouldnt talk like that  but eventually someone had to talk  should someone speak  you sit there  like a child in the middle of the slaughterhouse  and you let your beard grow  whose fault is it  find the answer yourself  he turned slowly and left  on the threshold  he clung to the doorpost  so as not to fall  and now his footsteps echoed down the hall  i avoided looking at    but  in spite of myself  i suddenly met his eyes  i wanted to get up  take her in my arms  stroke her hair  i did not move
