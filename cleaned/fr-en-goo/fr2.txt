the hallway was empty  i remained motionless for a moment behind the closed door  the groan of the wind enveloped the waterproof sheath of the hose  on the panel of the door  i saw  pasted askew  carelessly  a square of plaster  covered with an inscription in pencil   man   i looked at that word  scribbled indistinctly  and wanted to go back to snaut  i changed my mind  his demented warnings still vibrated in my ears  i walked down the passage  my shoulders bent under the weight of the suit  softly  fleeing more or less consciously from some invisible observer  i returned to the rotunda  as i walked out of the hallway  i found two doors to my left and two doors to my right  i read the names of the occupants  dr  gibarian  dr  snaut  dr  sartorius  no plaque was attached to the fourth door  i hesitated  squeezed the handle gently  and slowly opened the door  by pushing the panel  i had the presentiment  almost the certainty  that there was someone in the room  i entered  there was nobody  a concave picture window  only slightly smaller than the one in the cabin where id discovered snaut  overlooked the ocean  which gleamed here in the sun with a greasy sheen  the waves seeming to secrete a reddish oil  crimson reflections filled the whole room  the layout of which recalled a ships cabin  on one side  surrounded by shelves laden with books  a mechanical bed had been pushed up against the wall  on the other side  between the numerous cupboards  hung nickel frames   series of aerial views  glued end to end with adhesive strips   and racks of test tubes and retorts  plugged with cotton swabs  in front of the window  two rows of white enamel boxes obstructed the passage  i lifted a few   16   lids  the boxes were stuffed with instruments of all kinds  interspersed with plastic pipes  in each corner  there was a faucet  a refrigeration installation  a demister  a microscope had been placed on the floor  for lack of space on the large table next to the window  turning around  i saw near the front door a tall cupboard  it was ajar and contained coveralls  work coats  insulating aprons  linen  planetary exploration boots  polished aluminum cylinders   oxygen tanks for portable devices  two of these devices  equipped with their masks  hung  hooked to the handle of the vertical bed  everywhere was the same chaos  a disorder that we had rudely and hastily tried to hide  i sniffed the air  i smelled a faint odor of chemical reagents and traces of a more pungent odor   chlorine  instinctively  i looked for the grilles of the air vents  under the ceiling  attached to the bars  ribbons of paper fluttered gently  the blowers were working  providing normal air circulation  i cleared two chairs laden with books  devices and tools that i put down at the other end of the room  piling them up as best i could  so as to leave a relatively free space around the bed  between the cupboard and bookcases  i pulled out a support to hang my diving suit on  i grabbed the end of the zipper  then unclenched my fingers  held back by the confused idea that i was stripping myself of a shield  i couldnt make up my mind to abandon my diving suit  again i looked around the room  i checked that the door was firmly closed  that it had no lock  and after a brief hesitation  i dragged some of the heaviest boxes to the threshold  having thus temporarily barricaded myself  in three jerks i freed myself from my rattling carapace  a narrow mirror  set in a cupboard door  reflected part of the bedroom  out of the corner of my eye  i caught a moving shape  i jumped  but it was only my own reflection  the sweater under the diving suit was soaked with sweat  i pulled it out and pushed open a sliding wardrobe  it slid down the wall  revealing the shiny walls of a small bathroom  a flat  elongated box rested in the hollow of the shower basin  i carried the box without difficulty into the bedroom  when i put it back on the floor  a spring popped off the lid and i saw compartments  filled with strange objects  blanks of dark metal  grotesque replicas of the instruments contained in the cupboards  none of the instruments in the box were usable  they were blunted  atrophied  melted  as if emerging from a brazier  stranger still  even the ceramic handles  practically non fusible  had been deformed  no laboratory oven  heated to maximum temperature  could have melted them   perhaps an atomic battery  from the pocket of my suit  i pulled out a radiation counter  but the little black beak remained silent when i approached the debris  all i had on my body was a slip and a mesh swimsuit  i quickly pulled them off  throwing them away from me  and ran into the shower  the shock of the water was beneficial  spinning under the hard  hot jet  i rubbed myself with excessive vigor  spattering the walls  expelling  stripping from my skin all that filth of troubled apprehensions that had permeated me since my arrival  i searched the closet and found a training suit  which could also be worn under the suit  as i was about to slip all of my meager possessions into a pocket  i felt a hard object stuck among the sheets of the notepad  it was a key  the key to my apartment  over there  on earth  undecided  i turned the key between my fingers  finally  i put it on the table  suddenly it occurred to me that i would need a weapon  a pocketknife probably wasnt what i needed  but i didnt have anything else and i wasnt going to go looking for a radioactive gun or anything like that  i sat down on a tubular stool  in the middle of the empty space  i wanted to be alone  with satisfaction  i found that i had more than half an hour  by nature  i scrupulously respected my commitments  important or negligible  the hands of the clock   of which twenty four signs divided the dial   indicated seven oclock  the sun   18   was going down  seven oclock here was eight oclock aboard the prometheus  solaris  on moddards screens  was no more than an indistinct dust  confused with the stars  well  what did the prometheus matter to me  i closed my eyes  all i could hear was the groan of the pipes and a faint splash of water in the bathroom  gibarian was dead  shortly before  if i understood correctly  what had they done with his body  had they buried him  no  on this planet it was impossible  i pondered the question for a long time  preoccupied exclusively with the fate of the corpse  then i realized the absurdity of my thoughts  i got up and started to walk up and down  with the tip of my foot  i bumped into a haversack emerging from a pile of books  i bent down  i picked it up  it contained a bottle of dark glass  a bottle so light it looked like it had been blown into paper  i examined it outside the window  in the purple glow of a gloomy twilight  invaded by mists of soot  what was happening to me  why let myself be distracted by ramblings  or by the first knick knack that came to hand  i started  the lamps had come on  controlled by a photoelectric cell  the sun had just set  what would happen   i was so tense that the feeling of empty space behind me became unbearable  i decided to fight against myself  i pulled up a chair from the bookcase and selected a volume that had long been familiar to me  the second volume of hughes and eugels old monograph  historia solaris  i leaned the big  solidly bound book on my knees  i started leafing through it  solaris was discovered about a hundred years before i was born  the planet revolves around two suns   a red sun and a blue sun  no ship has approached the planet for forty years since its discovery  at that time  the gamow shapley theory  stating that life was impossible on the satellite planets of two solar bodies  was held to be a certainty  the orbit is constantly   19   modified by the varying play of gravitation  during the revolution around the two suns  the orbit  because of the variations of gravitation  flattens or distends and the elements of life  if they appear  are infallibly destroyed  either by an intense radiation of heat  or by an extreme drop in temperature  these modifications occur in a time estimated in millions of years  therefore a very short time   according to the laws of astronomy or biology  evolution requires hundreds of millions  if not a billion of years   according to the first calculations  solaris should in five hundred thousand years approach half of an astronomical unit of its red sun  and a million years later sink into the incandescent star  but  at the end of a few decades already  it seemed to be discovered that the orbit did not in any way show the expected modifications  it was stable  as stable as the orbits of the planets in our solar system  we began again  with extreme precision  the observations and calculations  which simply confirmed the first conclusions  the orbit of solaris was unstable  a modest unit among the hundreds of planets discovered annually  to which the great statistics confined themselves to devoting a few lines defining the peculiarities of motion  solaris rose little by little to the rank of celestial body worthy of more considerable attention  four years after this promotion  flying over the planet with the laakon and two auxiliary ships  ottenskjolds expedition set out to study solaris  this expedition had only the character of a preparatory reconnaissance  even improvised  the scientists not being equipped to land  ottenskjold placed in equatorial and polar orbits a large number of automatic satellite observatories  the main function of which was to measure gravitational potentials  in addition  the surface of the planet was studied  covered by an ocean dotted with innumerable islands in the configuration of a high plateau    the total area of these islands is less than the area of europe  although the diameter of   20   solaris is one fifth larger than that of the earth  these stretches of rocky and desolate territory  irregularly distributed  are mainly grouped in the southern hemisphere    the composition of the atmosphere  devoid of oxygen  was also analyzed and very precise measurements of the density of the planet were made  from which the albedo and other astronomical characteristics were determined  as expected  no trace of life was found  either on the islands or in the ocean  over the next ten years  solaris became the center of attraction for all observatories devoted to the study of that region of space  the planet  however  showed an astonishing tendency to maintain a gravitational orbit which  without a doubt  should have been unstable  the affair almost turned into a scandal  the results of the observations being bound to be inexact  attempts were made to overwhelm  for the good of science  certain scholars  or such computers which they used  lack of funds delayed the start of a real solarist expedition for three years  finally  shannahan  having completed his team  obtained from the institute three units of tonnage c  the largest cosmic vessels of the time  a year and a half before the arrival of the expedition  which departed from alpha aquarius  a second exploration fleet  acting on behalf of the institute  had placed an automatic satellite  luna 247  into solarist orbit  this satelloid  after three successive reconstructions  carried out several decades apart  still functions today    the data provided by the satellite definitively confirmed the observations of the ottenskjold expedition  concerning the active character of the movements of the ocean  one of shannahans ships remained in high orbit  the other two  after preliminary tests  landed on a rocky territory  about six hundred square miles  in the southern hemisphere of solaris  the work of the expedition lasted eighteen months and was carried out under favorable conditions  except for a regrettable accident caused by the defective functioning of the apparatus  the team of scientists  however  split into two opposing camps   21   with the ocean being the subject of the dispute  based on the analyses  it was assumed that the ocean was an organic formation  at that time  no one had yet dared to declare it alive   but  while biologists considered it a primitive formation   a kind of gigantic whole  a fluid cell  unique and monstrous  which they called  prebiological formation    which surrounded the globe with a colloidal envelope reaching in places a a few miles thick   astronomers and physicists asserted that it must be an extraordinarily evolved organized structure  in their view  the ocean was perhaps even more complex than earths organic structures  since it was capable of effectively influencing the course of the planets orbit  indeed  no other cause had been discovered that could explain the behavior of solaris  moreover  the planetophysicists had established a relation between certain processes of the plasmatic ocean and the gravitational potential measured locally  potential which modified in accordance with the  transformations of matter  of the ocean  so it was physicists  not biologists  who put forward this paradoxical formulation   plasma machine   meaning by this a formation perhaps deprived of life  according to our conceptions  but capable of undertaking useful activities   at the astronomical scale  we must hasten to add it  on the occasion of this quarrel   the turmoil of which  in a few weeks  reached the most eminent authorities   the doctrine of gamow shapley  uncontested for eighty years  found itself shaken for the first time  some still continued to support gamow shapleys assertions that the ocean had nothing in common with life  that it was not a  para  or  prebiological  formation  but a geological formation  little current certainly  and capable only of stabilizing the orbit of solaris  in spite of the variation of the forces of attraction  to support the argument  reference was made to le chateliers law    22   in contrast to this conservative attitude  new hypotheses were put forward   including that of civito vitta  one of the most elaborate   proclaiming that the ocean was the result of a dialectical development  from its first form of pre ocean  solution of slowly reacting chemical bodies  and by the force of circumstances  the changes of orbit threatening its existence   it had arrived in a single leap at the stage of  homeostatic ocean   without going through all degrees of terrestrial evolution  avoiding the unicellular and multicellular phases  vegetable and animal evolution  the constitution of a nervous and cerebral system  in other words  and unlike terrestrial organisms  it had not adapted to its environment in a few hundred million years  to finally give birth to the first representatives of a species endowed with reason  but it had immediately dominated its environment    the point of view was original  however  it was still unknown how this colloidal envelope could stabilize the orbit of the celestial body  for nearly a century  we have known devices capable of artificially creating fields of attraction and gravitation   gravitors  but no one was able to imagine how this formless glue could obtain an effect  which the gravitors caused by complicated nuclear reactions and extraordinarily high temperatures  the newspapers of that time  arousing the curiosity of the average reader and the anger of the scholar  were full of the most implausible fables on the subject of the  solaris mystery   one columnist went so far as to claim that the ocean was  a distant relative of our electric gymnotes  when  to some extent  the problem was unraveled  it turned out that the explanation   as often happened later in the field of solarist studies   replaced one enigma by another  perhaps even more surprising  the observations showed  at least  that the ocean did not act according to the laws of our gravitation  which  moreover  would have been impossible   but succeeded in directly imposing the periodicity of the course  this resulted in  among other things  deviations   23   in the measurement of time on one and the same meridian of solaris  so not only did the ocean know  in a certain sense  the einstein boevia theory  he also knew how to exploit the consequences  while we could not say the same   at the statement of this hypothesis  one of the most violent storms of the century was unleashed within the scholarly world  venerable theories  universally accepted  crumbled  audaciously heretical articles invaded the specialized literature   brilliant ocean  or  gravitating colloid   the question ignited the spirits  this all happened several years before i was born  when i was a student   new data having been collected in the meantime   it was already generally accepted that life existed on solaris  although limited to a single inhabitant    the second volume of hughes and eugel  which i continued to leaf through mechanically  began with a systematization as ingenious as it was amusing  the classification table had three definitions  type   polythera  order   syncytialia  category   shapeshifter  as if we knew of an infinite number of specimens of the species  when in reality there was only one   weighing  it is true  seven hundred billion tons  under my fingers fluttered colorful figures  picturesque graphs  analytical records and spectral diagrams  exposing the type and rate of fundamental transformations as well as chemical reactions  quickly  infallibly  the thick volume led me to the solid ground of mathematical faith  it could be concluded that we had acquired full knowledge of this representative of the metamorph category  which extended a few hundred meters under the metallic hull of the station  veiled at this moment by the shadows of a night which would last four hours  in reality  not everyone was yet convinced that the ocean was actually a living  creature  and even less  it goes without saying  that it was endowed with reason  i put the big book back on the shelf and picked up the next volume  it was divided into two parts  the first was devoted to a summary of countless attempts  all of which were aimed at establishing contact with the ocean  at the time of my studies  i remembered it perfectly  this establishment of contact was the object of anecdotes  of jokes and endless jeers  compared to the abundance of speculation aroused by this problem  medieval scholasticism seemed a model of luminous evidence  the second part  nearly one thousand three hundred pages  included only the bibliography relating to the subject  the texts could not have found a place in the room where i was standing  the first attempts at contact were attempted through specially designed electronic devices  which transformed the stimuli  emitted bilaterally  the ocean participated actively in these operations  since it fashioned the devices  all of this  however  remained obscure  what exactly was this  participation   the ocean modified certain elements of the submerged instruments  consequently  the planned rhythm of the discharges was upset and the recording devices reproduced a multitude of signals  fragmentary testimonies of some fantastic activity  escaping in fact all analysis  did this data reflect a momentary state of stimulation  or constant impulses  related to the gigantic structures that the ocean was creating somewhere  at the antipodes of the region where the researchers were  had electronic devices recorded the impenetrable manifestation of the venerable secrets of this ocean  had he given us his masterpieces  how to know   the stimulus had not provoked two identical reactions  sometimes the devices failed to burst under the violence of the impulses  sometimes there was absolute silence  in short  it was impossible to obtain the repetition of any manifestation previously observed  constantly  it seemed as if one were on the verge of deciphering the growing mass of recorded clues  hadnt electronic brains of practically unlimited information capacity been built for this purpose  such as no other problem had required until then  in fact  we got results  the ocean   source of electrical  magnetic and gravitational impulses   expressed itself in a kind of mathematical language  also  by appealing to one of the most abstract branches of analysis  the law of large numbers  it was possible to classify certain frequencies of current discharges  structural homologies appeared  already observed by physicists in the branch of science which takes into consideration the reciprocal relations of energy and matter  of components and compounds  of the finite and the infinite  this correspondence convinced the scientists that they were in the presence of a monster endowed with reason  a protoplasmic brain ocean  enveloping the whole planet and wasting its time in extravagant theoretical considerations of universal reality  our devices  by surprise  had seized the tiny snippets of a formidable monologue  which unfolded eternally in the depths of this disproportionate brain and which  necessarily  exceeded our understanding  so much for mathematicians  these hypotheses  according to some  underestimated the possibilities of the human mind  they bowed before the unknown  proclaiming an old doctrine  insolently exhumed  ignoramus et ignorabimus  others thought that the hypotheses of mathematicians were sterile and dangerous drivel  because they helped to create a contemporary mythology  based on the giant brain   electronic or plasma  it doesnt matter   considered as the ultimate objective of the existence and sum of life  still others  but scholars were legion and everyone had their opinion  if one compared the area of  contact  testing with the other branches of solarist studies  where specialization had developed strongly  particularly during the last quarter of a century  one found that a cybernetic solarist had difficulty in be heard by a symmetryadologist solarist  veubeke  director of the institute at the time of my studies  had asked one day  jokingly   how do you want to communicate with the ocean  when you yourself   26   can no longer understand yourself   the joke contained a fair amount of truth  there was nothing arbitrary about putting the ocean in the shapeshifter category  its undulating surface could give rise to extremely diverse formations  unlike anything seen on earth  and the function   process of adaptation  recognition or otherwise   of these sudden eruptions of plasma  creativity  remained a riddle  lifting the heavy volume with both hands  i put it back on the shelf and i said to myself that our scholarship  all the information accumulated in the libraries  was only a useless jumble  a quagmire of testimonies and suppositions  and that we had not progressed an inch since the beginning of the research  seventy eight years earlier  that the situation was much worse than in the days of the pioneers  since the assiduous efforts of so many years had not resulted in any indisputable certainty  all of our precise knowledge was strictly negative  the ocean did not use machines  in certain circumstances  however  he seemed able to build them  during the first and second year of the exploration work  he had reproduced the elements of a few submerged devices  thereafter  he purely and simply ignored the experiments which we pursued with benedictine patience  as if he had lost all interest in our instruments and our activities  as if  consequently  he had lost interest in us   it had no nervous system   i continue to paint the picture of our  negative knowledge    nor cells  and its structure was not protean  he did not always react to even the most powerful stimuli  he completely  ignored   for example  the catastrophic accident that occurred during gieses second expedition  an auxiliary rocket  falling from a height of three hundred thousand meters  crashed on the surface of the planet  the radioactive explosion of its nuclear reserves destroying the plasma within a radius of two thousand five hundred meters     27   gradually  in scholarly circles  people came to judge the  solaris affair  as a  lost game   in particular among the administrators of the institute  where voices had been raised recently  suggesting to cut the credits and to suspend research  nobody  until then  had dared to speak of a definitive liquidation of the station  such a decision would have too obviously meant defeat  moreover  during unofficial talks  many of our scholars advocated abandoning the  solaris affair  along a line of retreat as  honourable  as possible  many scientists  however  especially among the young  imperceptibly came to regard  business  as a touchstone of individual values   all things considered   they said   the challenge is not just to break into solarist civilization  it is essentially about us  about the limits of human knowledge  for a time the opinion prevailed  spread zealously by the daily press  that the  thinking ocean  of solaris was a gigantic brain  prodigiously developed  and millions of years ahead of our own civilization    a kind of  cosmic yogi   a sage  a representation of omniscience  who had long since understood the vanity of all activity and who  for this reason  now entrenched himself in an unshakeable silence  the opinion was incorrect  for the living ocean acted  not  of course  according to human notions  he did not build cities or bridges  he did not build flying machines  he did not try to abolish distances and was not concerned with the conquest of space  decisive criterion  according to some  of the incontestable superiority of man   the ocean gave itself up to innumerable transformations  to an  ontological self metamorphosis    scholarly terms are not lacking in the list of solarist activities  on the other hand  any scientist attaching himself to the study of the multiple solariana experiences the irresistible impression that he perceives the fragments of an intelligent construction  genius perhaps  mixed without order with absurd productions  apparently engendered by the delirium  thus was born  contrary to the  ocean yogi  conception  the idea of the  ocean moron   these hypotheses unearth one of the oldest philosophical problems   the relationship of matter and spirit  of spirit and consciousness  du haart was not lacking in audacity when he was the first to claim that the ocean was endowed with consciousness  the problem  which methodologists hastened to declare metaphysical  gave rise to a good deal of discussion and dispute  was it possible that thought was deprived of consciousness  besides  could we call thought the processes observed in the ocean  is a mountain a very big rock  is a planet a huge mountain  we remained free to choose our terminology  but the new scale of magnitude introduced new standards and new phenomena  the question presented itself as a contemporary transposition of the problem of squaring the circle  every independent thinker strove to cram his personal contribution into the treasury of solarist studies  new theories abounded  the ocean bore witness to a state of degeneration  of regression  following a phase of  intellectual plenitude   it was a wandering neoplasm from the bodies of the previous inhabitants of the planet  all of which he had devoured  swallowed up  and whose residues he had melted into this eternal  self reproducing form of supercellular element  in the white light of the fluorescent tubes  a pale imitation of the clarity of an earthly day  i cleared the table of the appliances and the books that cluttered it  on the plastic tray  i unrolled the map of solaris and stared at it  arms outstretched  hands resting on the chrome edge of the table  the living ocean had its shoals and its trenches  its islands  covered with a decaying mineral deposit  were certainly of the nature of the ocean floor   did it order the eruption and subsidence of the rock formations buried in its abyss  no one knew  considering the large flat projection of the two hemispheres  mottled with various shades of blue and violet  i felt that poignant astonishment which had often seized me  and which i had experienced as a child  at school  on learning the existence of solaris  lost in contemplation of this stunning map  i thought of nothing  no more of the mystery surrounding gibarians death than of the uncertainty of my own future  the different sections of the ocean bore the names of the scientists who had explored them  i was studying the bulge of thexall  which bathed the equatorial archipelagos  when i had the sudden sensation that someone was looking at me  i was leaning over the map  but i couldnt see it anymore  an invincible numbness seized all my limbs  boxes and a small cupboard barricaded the door in front of me  its a robot  i told myself   though i hadnt found any in the room  and none could have entered without my knowledge  on my neck and back  the skin began to burn  the weight of that heavy  motionless gaze became unbearable  my head buried in the crook of my shoulders  i leaned harder and harder against the table  which began to slide slowly  this movement freed me  i pivoted  the room was empty  ahead of me was only the wide arched window  and the night beyond  but the same feeling persisted  the night looked at me  the amorphous night  blind  immense  without borders  no star lit the darkness behind the glass  i drew the opaque curtains  i had not spent an hour in the station and already i was showing morbid signs  was it an effect of gibarians death  as i knew him  i had judged until then that nothing could ever have troubled his mind  i wasnt so sure anymore  i was standing in the middle of the room  next to the table  my breathing calmed down  i felt the sweat cool on my forehead  what had i been thinking a moment ago  ah  yes   to the robots  i was surprised not to have met any  anywhere  where had they all gone  the only one i had contact with   by far   belonged to the vehicle reception services  but the others  i looked at my watch  it was time to join snaut  i went out  luminous filaments  running under the ceiling  dimly lighted the rotunda  i approached gibarians door and stood motionless for a long time  silence  silence everywhere  i squeezed the handle  in reality  i had no intention of entering  the handle lowered  the door moved aside  revealing a black slit  then the lamps came on  i quickly crossed the threshold and quietly closed the door  then i turned around  shoulders  i brushed the panel of the door  the room was bigger than mine  a curtain dotted with small pink and blue flowers  no doubt brought from earth with personal effects and not provided for in the stations equipment  veiled three quarters of the panoramic window  along the walls were rows of shelves  separated by cupboards  both varnished in pale green enamel with silver reflections  the bookcases and cupboards had been emptied of their contents  which piled up in heaps between the stools and the armchairs  at my feet  blocking the way  two rolling tables were overturned  buried under a heap of periodicals escaping from stuffed briefcases  which had burst  books  the leaves fanned out  were smeared with multicolored liquids  which had been spilled by breaking retorts and flasks with corroded stoppers  glass containers so thick that a simple fall  even from a considerable height  could thus have smashed them  beneath the window lay a desk  dwarfing a swing arm task lamp  two legs of an overturned stool sank into the half open drawers  a veritable tide of papers of all sizes  covered with handwritten characters  drowned the floor  i recognized gibarians handwriting and leaned forward  as i lifted the loose sheets  i noticed that my hand cast a double shadow  i sat up  the pink curtain blazed  crossed by an incandescent line of bluish white which was widening  i lifted the curtain   an unbearable conflagration spread across the horizon  driving away an army of spectral shadows  rising from between the waves and stretching towards the station  it was dawn  after the one hour nocturnal interlude  the planets second sun  the blue sun  rose in the sky  when i returned to my pile of papers  the automatic switch turned off the lights  i came across the precise description of an experiment  decided upon three weeks before  gibarian intended to expose the plasma to extremely intense x ray radiation  from the content of the text  i understood that it was intended for sartorius  who was to organize the operations  i was holding a copy of the project in my hand  the whiteness of the sheets hurt my eyes  this new day was different from the previous one  in the warm light of the orange sun  red mists hovered above the black ocean with bloody reflections and almost constantly veiled the waves  the clouds  the sky with a crimson screen  now the blue sun was piercing the flower printed fabric with quartz light  my tanned hands looked gray  the room had changed  all objects with red reflections had faded  had turned gray brown  while white  green and yellow objects had acquired a more vivid luster and seemed to emit their own light  blinking  i risked another peek through the slit in the curtain  a stretch of fluid metal vibrated and throbbed under a sky of white flames  i lowered my eyes and stepped back  on the sink shelf  the edge of which was chipped  i found a pair of large dark glasses  they covered half of my face  the curtain was now radiating sodium light  i continued to read  picking up the pages and placing them on the only table that remained usable  the text had gaps  i rummaged through the scattered pages in vain  getting my hands on reports of experiments already undertaken  i learned that for four consecutive days gibarian and sartorius had subjected the ocean to radiation at a point fourteen hundred miles from the present position of the station    however  the use of x rays was prohibited by a un convention  because of their harmful action  and i was certain that no one had transmitted any request to the earth  asking for authorization to proceed with such experiences  raising my head  i saw my image in the mirror of a half open wardrobe door  a pale face  masked by dark glasses  the room  all in white and blue reflections  looked odd  too  but soon i heard a prolonged creaking and external  airtight shutters slid in front of the window  there was a moment of darkness  then the lamps came on  which seemed strangely dim to me  it was getting hotter and hotter  the steady flow of air conditioning units sounded like an exasperated yelp  the stations refrigeration equipment was working at full capacity  however  the oppressive heat kept rising  i heard footsteps  someone was walking in the rotunda  in two silent leaps  i was near the door  the footsteps slowed down  the stranger was behind the door  the handle lowered  without thinking  mechanically  i seize it  the pressure did not increase  it did not weaken  no one on either side of the door raised their voices  each holding the handle  we stayed like that for a while  suddenly  the handle straightened  slipping out of my hands  the footsteps  muffled  receded  i listened again  my ear glued to the panel  i heard nothing more
