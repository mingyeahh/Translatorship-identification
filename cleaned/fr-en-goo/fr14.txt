sitting in front of the large window  i watched the ocean  i had nothing to do  the report  written in five days  was now a beam of waves racing through the void  somewhere beyond the constellation of orion  when he reached the dark nebula  which absorbs all signals and light rays in a mass of eight trillion cubic miles  our report would be picked up by the first antenna in a chain of relays  then  describing a gigantic arc  jumping from one radio buoy to another in leaps of billions of kilometres  the report would finally reach the last relay  a metal block stuffed with precision instruments  and the elongated beak of the retransmission antenna would pick up the beam of waves by concentrating it  to relaunch it in space  towards the earth  months would then pass  then a similar beam of energy  starting from the earth  would dig a furrow of disturbances in the field of gravitation of the galaxy  hitting the cosmic cloud head on  it would continue its course without loss of speed  amplified by the long chain of free buoys which would direct it towards the two suns of solaris  under the red sun  the ocean was blacker than ever  a red mist veiled the horizon  the weather  exceptionally heavy  seemed to announce one of those terrible hurricanes which were unleashed two or three times a year on the surface of the planet  whose sole inhabitant   it is permitted to suppose   controlled the climate and ordered the storms  for months to come  i would stay there  from the height of my observatory  i would contemplate the birth of days   disc of white gold or faded purple  sometimes i would surprise the rays of dawn playing among the fluid shapes of some building rising from the ocean  i would see the sun reflected on the silvery bubble of a symmetry  i would follow with my gaze the oscillations of the graceful agilus which bend in the wind and i would linger to examine the old dusty mimoids  and  one day  the screens of all the videophones would begin to flicker  all the signaling devices  dormant for a long time  would come back to life  revived by an impulse emitted hundreds of billions of kilometers away and announcing the arrival of a metallic colossus  which would descend towards us with the deafening noise of its gravitational forces  it would be the ulysses  or the prometheus  or some other cosmic cruiser  through the hatch i would exit onto the flat roof of the station  i would then see battalions of massive  white shelled automatons  creatures foreign to original sin  who in their innocence go to the end of their task  not hesitating to destroy themselves or to destroy the unforeseen obstacle   strictly obeying the orders recorded by the crystals of their memory  then  faster than sound  the ship would rise soundlessly  leaving far behind  above the ocean  a volley of detonations  and the faces of all the passengers would light up at the idea of returning home  the return home  but what did that mean for me  earth   i thought of those big  crowded  noisy cities where i would get lost  where i would get lost   i thought of those cities  as i had thought of the ocean  on the second or third night  when i had wanted to rush into black waves  i will drown among men  i will be silent and attentive   a valued companion  ill have lots of connections  friends  and wives   and maybe even a wife  for a while  i will have to make an effort to smile  to bow  to stand up  to perform the thousand little gestures of which life on earth is made up  while waiting for all these gestures to become reflexes again  i will find new interests  new occupations  to which i will not give myself entirely  no  never again will i give myself entirely to anything or anyone  and perhaps  at night  i will look in the direction of the dark nebula  black curtain which veils the brilliance of the two suns  and ill remember everything  even what im thinking at the moment  with a condescending smile  mingled with a little regret  i will remember my follies and my hopes  and this kelvin of the future will be worth no less than the kelvin of the past  which was ready to do anything in the name of an ambitious project  called contact  and no one will have the right to judge me  snaut entered the cabin  he looked around  then stopped looking at me  i got up and approached the table    you need me     you have nothing to do   he said  i could give you work  calculations  oh  not a very urgent job     i smile    thank you  its not worth it  he was looking out the window   are you quite sure of that    yeah i was thinking about different things  and    id rather you thought a little less   but you dont know what i was thinking   tell me    do you believe in god  he gave me a worried look    what      who still believes today     i took a casual tone    its not that simple  this is not the traditional god of earth religions  i am not a specialist in the history of religions and i may not have invented anything  do you know  by any chance  if there ever was a faith in an imperfect god  he frowned   imperfect  what do you mean   in some sense  the gods of all religions were imperfect  charged only with amplified human attributes  the god of the old testament  for example  demanded humble submission and sacrifices  he was jealous of other gods  the greek gods  with their quarrelsome temper  their family disputes  were as imperfect as men  i interrupted him    no  im not thinking of a god whose imperfection results from the candor of his human creators  but whose imperfection represents the fundamental  immanent characteristic  a god limited in his omniscience and in his omnipotence  fallible  incapable of foreseeing the consequences of his acts  creating phenomena which engender horror  he is a god  crippled  whose ambitions exceed his strength  and who does not immediately realize it  a god who created clocks  but not the time they measure  he created systems  or mechanisms  serving definite ends  but which went beyond those ends and betrayed them  and he created eternity  which was to measure his power  and which measures his infinite defeat  snaut hesitated  but there was no longer in his attitude the wary reserve he had been showing me lately  manicheism used to be    i interrupted him immediately  nothing in common with the principle of good and evil  this god doesnt exist outside of matter  he would like to free himself from matter  but he cant  snaut thought for a moment    i dont know of any such religion  this kind of religion was never necessary  if i understand you  and im afraid i understood you  you envision an evolving god  who develops over time  increases  and continues to increase his power by becoming aware of his powerlessness  for your god  the divine condition is a hopeless situation   and  having understood his situation  he despairs  yes  but the desperate god  isnt it the man  my dear kelvin  its man youre talking to me about  and its not just a damn philosophy  its even a damn mysticism  i persisted  no  its not about the man  it is possible that in some respects man fits this working definition  but that is because it has many gaps  man  despite appearances  does not create goals  time   the era   imposes them on him  man can serve his time or revolt  but the object to which he devotes his care  or against which he rebels  is given to him from without  if there were only one man  he could apparently try the experiment of creating goals for himself in complete freedom   apparently  because the man who has not been brought up among other humans cannot become a male  and the one  the one im thinking of  he cant exist in the plural  you understand  snaut pointed to the window   ah   he said  then   no  neither does he  during his development  he undoubtedly came very close to the divine state  but he withdrew into himself too soon  hes more of an anchorite  a hermit of the cosmos  not a god  he repeats himself  snaut  and the one im thinking of would never repeat himself  it may have already been born somewhere  in a corner of the galaxy  and soon  seized with a youthful intoxication  it will begin to extinguish stars  to light up others    we will notice it after some time   weve noticed that before   snaut said sourly  the novae and the supernovae  according to you  are these the candles of his altar   if you take what im saying literally    and solaris may be the cradle of your divine infant   snaut added  his smile widening and the creases around his eyes multiplying  solaris may be a first state of the despairing god    his intelligence may grow immensely    all the content of our solaristic libraries may just be the enormous repertoire of his infantile wail    i continued   and for a while we will have been the rattles of this baby   its possible  and do you know what you just did  youve created an entirely new solaris themed hypothesis   my compliments  immediately  everything is explained  the impossibility of establishing contact  the absence of answers  certain  lets say certain extravagances in his behavior towards us  everything is explained by the psychology of a small child  standing in front of the window  snaut growled    i renounce the paternity of the hypothesis  for a long time  we contemplated the black waves  a pale  elongated patch loomed to the east  in the mist that veiled the horizon  without taking his eyes off the shimmering desert  snaut suddenly asked   where did you get this conception of an imperfect god     i do not know  i find it very  very plausible  he is the only god i would believe in  a god whose passion is not redemption  a god who does not save anything  does not do anything   a god who simply is   a mimoid   snaut whispered    what are you saying   ah  yes  i had noticed that  a very old mimoid  both of us were looking towards the misty horizon  suddenly  i say   im going out   ive never left the station before  its a good opportunity  ill be back in half an hour    snauts eyes widened   what     youre going out    where are you going   i showed him the flesh colored stain blurred by the mist  over there  no impediment  i will take a small helicopter  i wouldnt want  when i return to earth  to have to confess that i am a solarist who has never set foot on solaris  i opened the closet and started rummaging through the jumpsuits  snaut watched me silently  finally  he said  i dont like it  i had chosen a combination  i turned around    what    for a long time  i had not experienced such excitement    what is troubling you   show off your cards  youre afraid that i    what an idea  i swear i dont mean i didnt even think about it  no  really not    i come with you    thank you  but i prefer to go out alone    i was putting on the jumpsuit   do you realize  my first flight over the ocean   snaut muttered something  but i didnt understand what he was saying  i hurriedly completed my equipment  he accompanied me to the space station  helped me free the device from its stall and place it on the launch disc  as i was about to adjust the suit  he asked abruptly   can i take your word for it    good god  snaut again   yes  you can take my word for it  where are the oxygen tanks  he says nothing more  when i had closed the transparent dome  i waved to him  he started the elevator  and i emerged onto the roof of the station  the motor awoke  hummed  the three bladed propeller whirled  the craft rose  strangely light  and the station quickly moved away  alone above the ocean  i saw this one with new eyes  i was flying at low altitude   between forty and sixty meters  for the first time  i felt an impression  often described by explorers and which i had never felt while looking down from the top of the station  the alternating movement which animated the shining waves did not evoke the undulations of the sea or the racing clouds  but an animal crawl   the incessant  extraordinarily slow contractions of muscular flesh secreting a crimson foam  as i began to turn  to steer toward the adrift mimoid  the sun struck me in the eye  and bloody lightning flashed on the curved windows  the black ocean  bristling with dark flames  was tinged with blue  the aircraft described too wide a curve and i was deported far downwind of the mimoid  a long irregular silhouette dominating the ocean  freed from the mist  the mimoid was no longer pink  but grey yellow  i lost sight of it for a moment and saw the station  which seemed to be placed at ocean level and whose shape recalled an ancient zeppelin  i corrected the direction  the steep mass of the mimoid  baroque sculpture  grows in the line of sight  i was afraid of hitting the bulbous protuberances and i straightened the helicopter so abruptly that it  losing speed  began to pitch  my precaution had been useless  for the rounded tops of these whimsical towers were lowering  i adjusted my flight to the islands drift and slowly  meter by meter  i descended until i brushed against the eroded peaks  the mimoid was not large  from end to end it was three quarters of a mile long  and a few hundred yards wide  in certain places  narrowings announced an approaching rupture  this mimoid was evidently a fragment of an incomparably larger formation  on a solarist scale  it was just a tiny shard  a shard  who knows how many weeks or months old  among the veiny rocks overlooking the ocean  i discovered a sort of beach  an inclined and relatively flat surface   a few tens of square meters   towards which i pointed the camera  i landed  not without difficulty   the propeller had almost hit a cliff which had suddenly risen in front of me  i stopped the engine and lifted the cupola  standing on the helicopters fin  i checked that it was in no danger of slipping into the ocean  fifteen paces from the aircraft  the waves licked the jagged shore  but the helicopter rested firmly on its circumflex legs  i jumped  to  earth   the cliff i had nearly snagged was an enormous bony membrane pierced with holes  erect vertically and traversed by gnarled bulges  a breach  a few meters wide  split this wall at an angle and made it possible to examine the interior of the island  already glimpsed through the openings with which the cliff was pierced  i carefully hoisted myself onto the nearest ledge my soles didnt slip  the suit didnt interfere with my movements  continuing to climb  i found myself at a height of four stories above the ocean and could contemplate a wide expanse of the petrified landscape which was lost in the depths of the mimoid  i thought i saw the ruins of an archaic city  a centuries old moroccan city  shaken by an earthquake or some other cataclysm  i could make out a tangled network of winding alleys  clogged with rubbish  alleys that descended steeply towards the shore bathed in unctuous foam  further on stood intact battlements  bastions with bare buttresses  in the swollen  sagging walls there were black holes  remnants of windows or loopholes  this whole floating city  leaning heavily to one side  like a ship about to capsize  was sliding at random  very slowly turning on itself  as evidenced by the movement of the sun in the firmament  the shadows crawled lazily through the alleys of this ruined city  and from time to time a polished surface reflected a ray of light towards me  i took the risk of climbing higher  then i stopped  trickles of fine sand began to flow from the rocks above my head and  falling into the ravines and alleys  the cascades of sand bounced in whirlwinds of dust  the mimoid  of course  is not made of stone and all that is needed is to lift a  rocky  chip and any resemblance to limestone is dispelled  the material that makes up the mimoid  lighter than pumice stone  is made up of small cells and extremely porous  i was high enough to feel the movement of the mimoid  not only did it advance  pushed by the black muscles of the ocean towards an unknown destination  but its inclination varied  it leaned now to one side  now to the other  and this languid rocking was accompanied by the light rustling of the yellow and gray foam which trickled along the emerged shore  this pendulum movement had been imprinted on the mimoid long before  no doubt at its birth  and the floating island  growing and breaking up  had retained the initial movement  having examined everything in sight from my aerial observatory  i descended cautiously  and only then  strangely enough  did i realize that the mimoid didnt interest me at all  that i had flown here not to become acquainted with the mimoid  but to become acquainted with the ocean  with the helicopter a few feet behind me  i sat down on the rough  cracked beach  a heavy black wave washed over the lower shore and spread out  not black  but dirty green  as it receded  the wave left viscous streams  which flowed trembling towards the ocean  i moved closer to the edge  and when the next wave came  i stretched out my arm  then there was faithfully reproduced a phenomenon already experienced by man a century earlier  the wave hesitated  retreated  then enveloped my hand  without however touching it  so that a thin layer of  air  separated my glove from this cavity  fluid a moment before and now really fleshy  slowly  i raised my hand  and the wave  or rather this outgrowth of the wave  rose simultaneously  still enveloping my hand in a translucent cyst with greenish reflections  i stood up  so that i could raise my hand again  the gelatinous substance  following the movement of my hand  stretched like a rope  but did not break  the very mass of the wave  completely flat  clung to the shore and surrounded my feet  without touching them   like some strange beast patiently awaiting the end of the experience  from the ocean had sprung a flower  whose calyx molded my fingers  i stepped back  the rod vibrated  wavered  irresolute  and fell back  the wave picked her up and retreated  i repeated the game several times  and then   as the first experimenter had noticed a hundred years earlier   a wave came  which avoided me  indifferent  as if sated with a too well known impression  i knew that to revive the  curiosity  of the ocean i would have to wait a few hours  i sat down again  i was no longer quite the same  disturbed by this phenomenon that i had provoked  and of which i had nevertheless read numerous descriptions  but no description could translate the experience as i had lived it  in all its movements  considered together or separately  each of these branches growing out of the ocean seemed to reveal a kind of cautious  but not shy  candor  a curiosity eager to know quickly  to understand a new  unexpected form  and a regret at having to withdraw  at not being able to cross the limits imposed by a mysterious law  what an inexpressible contrast between this alert curiosity and the shimmering immensity of the ocean that stretched out as far as the eye could see    never before had i felt its gigantic presence  its powerful and uncompromising silence  this secret force which regularly animated the waves  motionless  my gaze fixed  i plunged into a hitherto unknown universe of inertia  i slid down an irresistible slope  i identified with this fluid and mute colossus   as if i had forgiven him everything  without the slightest effort  without a word  without a thought  during the last week  i had behaved so well that snaut had ceased to pursue me with his wary gaze  on the surface  i was calm  secretly  and without admitting it clearly  i was waiting for something  what   his return   how could i have expected his return  we all know that we are material beings  subject to the laws of physiology and physics  and the very force of all our feelings united cannot fight against these laws  we can only hate them  the immemorial faith of lovers and poets in the power of love  stronger than death  the age old finis vitae sed non amoris is a lie  a useless lie  and not even funny  so  resign yourself to the idea of being a clock measuring the passage of time  sometimes out of order  sometimes repaired  and whose mechanism  as soon as the builder sets it in motion  engenders despair and love  resolve to the idea that each man relives old torments  all the more profound as they become more comical by repeating themselves  that human existence repeats itself  fine  but that it repeats itself like a worn out song  like the record that a drunk keeps spinning by throwing a coin in the slot machine  i did not believe that this fluid colossus  which had caused the death of hundreds of men  with which the whole human species had been trying in vain for so many years to establish even the most tenuous relationships  this ocean which carried me caring about me except for a speck of dust  no  i didnt think he could be moved by the tragedy of two human beings  but his activities had a purpose  to be honest  i wasnt absolutely sure  but to leave was to give up a chance  perhaps negligible  perhaps only imaginary    should we therefore continue to live here  among the furniture  the objects that we had both touched  in the air we had she breathed  in the name of what   hoping for his return  i expected nothing  and yet i lived in expectation   since she had disappeared  i was left with nothing but expectation  what accomplishments  what taunts  what tortures was i still waiting for  i didnt know it  i didnt know everything  and i persisted in the faith that the time for cruel miracles was not over
