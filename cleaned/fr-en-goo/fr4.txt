i followed a long deserted corridor  then i turned right  i had never stayed at the station  but on earth  in training  i had lived six weeks in the stations exact replica  i knew where the little aluminum staircase led  the library was not lit  groping  i found the switch  i consulted the map library  having composed the numbers for the first volume of the yearbook of solarist studies and the supplement  i pressed the computer key  a red light came on  i looked at the register  the two books were with gibarian  as well as the petit apocryphe  i turned off the light and went back downstairs  despite the footsteps i had heard receding  i was afraid to return to gibarians  she could come back  i stood behind the door for a long time  finally  pressing the handle  i forced myself to enter  there was no one in the room  i began to turn over the books scattered in front of the window  interrupting my research for a moment to close the cupboard  i suffered to see the empty space in the middle of the combinations  the supplement was not under the window and i began to methodically lift the books  one after the other  all around the room  when i had reached the last heap  between the bed and the cupboard  i discovered the volume i was looking for  i was hoping to find a mark and  indeed  a bookmark was slipped between the pages of the index  a name  which i did not know  had been underlined in red pencil  andre berton  the numbers next to the name referred the reader to two different chapters  i glanced at the first reference and learned that berton was a reserve pilot on shannahans ship  the next reference appeared about a hundred pages later  at first the expedition acted with extreme caution  then  sixteen days having elapsed  it appeared that the plasmatic ocean not only showed no sign of aggression  but evaded all direct contact with apparatus and men  recoiling whenever any body whatsoever approached its surface  also  shannahan and his substitute  timolis  renounced some of the precautions which hindered and delayed the course of the work  the expedition then split into small groups of two or three men  making flights over the ocean within a radius  sometimes  of a few hundred miles  the radiant ramps  previously used to delimit and protect the works  were transported to the base  four days passed  without the slightest accident  except for some damage to the equipment ensuring the oxygen supply to the suits  the atmosphere exerted an exceptionally corrosive action on the valves  which had to be replaced almost daily  on the morning of the fifth day  that is to say the twenty first day since the arrival of the expedition  two scientists  carucci and fechner  the first was a radiobiologist  the second a physicist   set out to explore above of the ocean  they were sailing on board an airmobile   not a flying vehicle  but a glider  moving on a cushion of compressed atmosphere  six hours later  the two explorers were not back  timolis  who was running the base in shannahans absence  sounded the alarm and organized the search  calling on all available men  by a fatal coincidence  the radio link that day had been cut an hour after the exploration parties had left   a large patch had obscured the red sun  which bombarded the upper layers of the atmosphere of a very dense shot of energetic particles  only the devices transmitting on ultra short waves continued to operate  limiting contact to a radius of twenty something miles  to make matters worse  the fog thickened before sunset and the search had to be interrupted  as the rescue parties returned to base  a helicopter spotted the airmobile just eighty miles from the command ship  the engine was running and the aircraft  apparently undamaged  was holding above the waves  in the translucent cabin there was only one man  half conscious   carucci  the airmobile was conveyed to the base  carucci received medical attention and quickly regained consciousness  he was unable to say anything about fechners disappearance  he only remembered that he himself had been overcome with suffocation when they had decided to return  the valve of his oxygen apparatus had failed and toxic gases  in small quantities  penetrated inside the suit  fechner  struggling to repair caruccis device  had been forced to unhook his seatbelt and stand up  it was the last thing carucci remembered  according to the opinion of specialists  it was possible to establish the sequence of events  to repair caruccis device  fechner had opened the roof of the cabin  because the low dome hindered its movements   an admissible procedure  the cabin of these vehicles not being airtight and constituting a simple screen against atmospheric infiltration and the wind    while fechner was busy with his companion  his own oxygen apparatus had probably also suffered damage  and fechner  no longer knowing what he was doing  had climbed to the top of the carcass  whence he had fallen into the ocean  fechner was therefore the first victim of the ocean  they searched for his body   the suit should have survived   without result  besides  perhaps the diving suit was floating somewhere  the expedition was unable to meticulously search the vast expanses of a rolling desert  covered in shreds of mist  by dusk   im picking up the story at the end of this twenty first day   all the rescue vehicles had returned to the base  with the exception of a large supply helicopter  in which berton had flown away  bertons helicopter reappeared an hour after dark  when serious concerns were beginning to arise  berton was obviously suffering from nervous concussion  he freed himself from his device and immediately began to run in all directions like a maniac  they mastered it  he cried and wept  it was astounding to say the least from a man with seventeen years of cosmic navigation and more than one flight in very arduous conditions  the doctors assumed that berton  too  had absorbed poisonous gases  however  having regained some semblance of balance  berton refused to leave  even for a moment  the interior of the base  and even to approach the window overlooking the ocean  after two days  he asked permission to dictate a report about his flight  he insisted on the importance of the revelations he was about to make  the council of the expedition studied the report and concluded with the morbid creation of a spirit intoxicated by the harmful gases of the atmosphere  the alleged revelations concerned  not the history of the expedition  but the development of bertons disease  so it was deemed superfluous to mention them  thats what the supplement said  i tell myself that bertons report must in any case deliver a key to the mystery   what event could have shaken a spaceflight veteran to such an extent  i again undertook to turn the books upside down  but the little apocrypha could not be found  i felt more and more tired  i postponed further research until the next day and left the room  passing the foot of a staircase  i saw specks of light spreading from top to bottom of the aluminum steps  sartorius was still working  i decided to go see him  upstairs it was warmer  a slight current of air was blowing  however  and the strips of paper were moving frantically at the grille of the ventilation openings  the hallway was low and wide  a thick sheet of frosted glass  in a chrome doorway  enclosed the main laboratory  inside  a dark curtain veiled the door  light fell from the pierced windows above the lintel  i squeezed the handle  the door didnt yield   i had foreseen it  no other sound came from the lab except an intermittent chirp   like the hiss of a malfunctioning gas burner  i knocked  no answer  i called   sartorius   dr  sartorius  its me  kelvin  the new one  i need to see you  please open the door  there was a rustle of crumpled papers   its me  kelvin   you have heard of me  i arrived from prometheus a few hours ago   i was screaming  my lips glued to the corner where the door clung to the metal jamb   dr  sartorius   i am alone  please open up  not a word  then the same rustle as before  then  the rattling of steel instruments being placed on a tray  then i couldnt believe my ears a series of tiny steps  the trotting of a child  the tight  hasty stamping of a pair of tiny legs  did remarkably nimble fingers imitate this gait by tapping the lid of an empty box  i yelled   dr  sartorius  are you opening the door or not   no response  only the trotting of a child and  simultaneously  the footsteps of a man walking on tiptoe  but  if this man moved  he could not at the same time imitate the gait of a child  besides  it didnt matter to me  without containing the rage that was invading me  i burst out    dr  sartorius  i did not undertake a journey of sixteen months to come and amuse myself with your comedies  i count to ten  if you dont open  ill break down the door  i doubted  moreover  to easily force this door  and the discharge of a gas pistol is not very powerful  yet i was determined to carry out my threat  one way or another  even if i had to resort to explosives  which i would no doubt find in quantity in the warehouse stores  i couldnt allow myself to give in  that is to say  i couldnt continue to play a fools game with the fake cards that the situation put in my hand  there was a sound of struggle  or simply repelled objects  the curtain split in the middle and a slender shadow cast itself on the frosted glass  which the light frosted around  a hoarse  high pitched voice spoke   ill open the door  but you have to promise me you wont come in     in that case  why open   ill be going out     good  i promise  the figure stepped back and the curtain was carefully closed  confused operations were taking place inside the laboratory  i heard scraping   was it a table scraping the floor  finally  the lock clicked  the pane of glass slid aside  and sartorius slipped into the hallway  he leaned against the door  he was very tall  thin  all bony under his whitish sweater  around his neck he had tied a black scarf  over his arm  folded in half  he wore a laboratory coat  burnt by the reagents  his extraordinarily narrow head was tilted to one side  i couldnt see his eyes  dark  arched glasses covered half of his face  the lower jaw was elongated  he had blue lips and huge ears  also bluish  he hadnt shaved  anti radiation gloves  red gloves  tied with laces  hung from his wrists  we stood for a moment looking at each other with undisguised aversion  his shaggy hair  he had obviously shaved it himself  was the color of lead  the beard repelled salt and pepper  like snaut  his forehead was burnt  but only halfway up  and pale above a horizontal line  he had to wear a kind of skullcap when he was exposed to the sun   im listening   he said  i got the feeling he didnt care what i had to say to him  tense and still glued to the glass plate  he was attentive above all to what was happening behind him  for fear of letting go of a folly  i did not know at first what to say  i began   my name is kelvin youve probably heard of me  i am  or rather i was  gibarians collaborator  his lean face  all vertical lines   thats how i imagined don quixote   was devoid of expression  and the black mask didnt help me find the words  i heard that gibarian  was dead    i interrupted myself    yes  i listen  the voice betrayed impatience   did he commit suicide   who found the body  was it you or snaut   why are you talking to me   didnt doctor snaut tell you   i wanted to hear what you had to say about this case   you studied psychology  dr  kelvin  didnt you    yes  well    do you serve science     yes of course  what report       you are not commissioner or inspector of the judicial police  it is now two forty and  instead of devoting yourself to your task  to the work that is assigned to you here  not content with forcing the door of my laboratory  you question me as if i were a suspect  sweat oozed down his forehead  i mastered myself with an effort  in a muffled voice  i said   you are a suspect  dr  sartorius   i tried to reach him at all costs and i added  furious    besides  you know it perfectly   kelvin  if you dont recant and apologize to me  ill file a complaint against you over the radio   why would i apologize to you   because you lock yourself up and barricade yourself in this lab  instead of coming to greet me  instead of letting me know honestly about whats going on here  have you completely lost your mind  and you  yes  who are you  a scholar or a wretched capon  answer  i dont know what i was screaming again  he didnt even flinch  large drops ran down her cheeks with dilated pores  suddenly i understood  he hadnt heard me  with both hands clasped behind his back  with all his might he held the door  which was swinging as if someone on the other side had pulled the panel  in a strange  high pitched voice  he moaned   go away   im begging you  for gods sake  go  come down  ill join you  ill do whatever you want  but im begging you  go  his voice betrayed such exhaustion that i mechanically stretched out my arms  wanting to help him hold that door open  he then let out a howl of horror  as if i had pointed a knife in his direction  i began to step back  while he shouted in his falsetto voice   go  go   im coming back  im coming back  im coming back  no no   he opened the door a crack and rushed inside  it seemed to me that a yellow object  a shiny disk  shone for a moment across his chest  a dull murmur was now coming from the laboratory  the curtain flew aside  a large shadow cast itself on the glass screen  then the curtain fell again and i saw nothing more  what was going on in the room  footsteps hit the ground  a mad pursuit ensued  followed by a terrible crash of glass and i heard a childs laughter  my legs were wobbling  i stared at the door with haggard eyes  silence had succeeded the uproar  i sat down on the plastic edge of a window  i sat there  maybe a quarter of an hour  i dont know  waiting for something  or just so stunned that i didnt want to get up  my head was exploding  i heard a continuous creak and an increased light shone on the landing  from my seat  i could see only part of the circular corridor that surrounded the laboratory  this was located at the top of the station  under the very carapace of the upper frame  so the walls were concave and inclined  with oblong windows a few meters apart  the exterior shutters were up  the blue day was coming to an end  a blinding glare pierced the thick panes  every nickel plated rod  every latch blazed  the door to the lab that big  rough pane of glass streamed pale sparks  i looked at my hands  resting on my knees  and turning gray in this spectral light  my right hand was holding the gas pistol   i hadnt realized it  i hadnt known that i had pulled the pistol from its scabbard  i sheathed it  i knew now that even a radioactive spear wouldnt have helped me much  what use would it have served me  to attack the door  to storm the laboratory  i got up  the solar disc  like an explosion of hydrogen  plunged into the ocean and penetrated me with a jet of horizontal  almost tangible rays  when the rays hit my cheek  i was going down the stairs   i felt them like a burning imprint  halfway up the stairs  i paused to think and climbed the steps again  i walked around the lab  as i said  the corridor surrounded him entirely  after having covered a hundred steps  i found myself in front of a second glass door  exactly like the other  i didnt try to open it  i knew it was closed  i scanned the wall  looking for a window  some slot  the idea of spying on sartorius had come to me quite naturally and without shame  i wanted to get rid of the assumptions and know the truth  a truth that in advance i imagined incomprehensible  i noticed that the rooms of the laboratory were lit by ceiling windows  arranged at the top of the carapace which enveloped the station  from the outside  it would therefore be possible to spy on sartorius  to start  i had to go down  equip myself with a diving suit and an oxygen apparatus  at the top of the stairs  i hesitated  these snuffboxes were probably ground glass slabs  but i wanted to see the laboratory  and no other solution presented itself  i returned to the middle floor  the door to the radio booth was open  snaut  slumped in his chair  was asleep  at the sound of my footsteps  he jumped and opened his eyes   hi  kelvin  he said hoarsely  as i remained silent  he asked  so you learned something    yes     he is not alone  snaut grimaced   ah  really  indeed  it is something  does he have visitors  almost involuntarily  i replied    i do not understand why you do not want to tell me what it is  since im staying here  sooner or later ill learn the truth  why these mysteries   when you yourself have received visitors  you will understand   it seemed to me that my presence bothered him and that he did not want to continue the conversation  i went out    where are you going   i did not answer  the space station was just as i left it  my charred capsule stood gaping on its base  i approached the locker room where the suits were lined up  but suddenly i lost interest in this escapade on the surface of the shell  i turned around and went down a spiral staircase  which led to the warehouse stores  downstairs  heaps of bottles and crates filled the cramped hallway  plates of bare metal  with bluish reflections  lined the walls  a few more steps  and under an arch appeared the frosty pipes of the refrigeration plant  at the end of the corridor  they engulfed themselves in a sleeve with a large plastic neck  when i opened the heavy door  two inches thick and sheathed in insulating foam  an icy cold penetrated me  i shivered  i was standing at the threshold of a cave cut in an ice floe  with sculpted reliefs in the shape of large coils  from which stalactites of ice hung  here too  buried under a layer of snow  there were crates  space capsules  side shelves were laden with translucent boxes and bags containing oily yellow matter  the vault was lowering  a shimmering curtain of frost hid the bottom of the cave  i parted the curtain  a large  elongated body  covered in canvas  rested on an aluminum grid  i lifted the edge of the tarp and saw gibarians frozen face  the straight black hair  barred with a gray streak  clung tightly to the skull  the cartilages of the throat protruded in a ridge in the middle of the neck  the dull eye stared fixedly at the vault  a tear of opaque ice clinging to the corner of the eyelids  the cold was so brutal that i had to grit my teeth to keep them from chattering  supporting the shroud with one hand  i brushed gibarians cheek with the other  i thought i touched a trunk of petrified wood  bristling with black  prickly hairs  the curve of the lips expressed an infinite  disdainful patience  letting go of the canvas  i noticed  protruding from between the folds  five black pearls arranged in order of size  i stiffened  i had recognized fingers  the oval pads of the toes of a bare foot  beneath the crumpled shroud  flattened against gibarians body  lay the black woman  slowly  i removed the tarp  the head  helmeted with frizzy hair  twisted into little tufts  rested in the crook of a massive black arm  the back shone  tense at the edge of the vertebrae  no movement animated this colossal body  i examined the soles of the bare feet again and found that they were not flattened or deformed by the weight they had to bear  that the walk had not hardened the skin  as intact and soft as the skin of the hands or the shoulders  with more difficulty than i had had in touching gibarians corpse  i forced myself to touch one of those bare feet  i then made another incredible observation  this body  abandoned in a freezer  this body lived and moved  the woman had withdrawn her foot  like a sleeping dog whose paw has been grabbed  i confusedly thought   shes going to freeze   but the body  having become peaceful again  was warm and i had felt the regular beating of the pulse in the pads of the toes  i stepped back  the curtain fell  i left hastily  coming out of the white grotto  the heat seemed stifling to me  i followed the corridor and climbed the stairs  which brought me back to the space station  i sat on the rings of a coiled parachute  i took my head in my hands  i was knocked out  my thoughts escaped  impossible to retain them  they slid down a steep slope  what was happening to me  if my reason collapsed  i might as well lose consciousness right away  the idea of immediate annihilation aroused an inexpressible unrealizable hope  no need to go find snaut or sartorius  no one could fully realize what i had experienced  what i had seen  what i had touched with my own hands  there was only one explanation  only one way out  madness  yes  thats it  i had gone mad as soon as i arrived here  the fumes from the ocean had attacked my brain  hallucinations followed one another  i should not waste my strength trying to solve illusory riddles  but ask for help from a doctor  radio the prometheus or some other ship  send an sos an unexpected change took place in me  at the thought that i had gone mad  i calmed down  i had however clearly heard the words of snaut  if snaut existed and if i had ever spoken with him  the hallucinations could have started much earlier  perhaps i was staying aboard the prometheus  a mental illness had suddenly struck me down and i faced the creations of my irritated brain  assuming i was ill  i was allowed to believe that i was going to be cured  which granted me a hope of deliverance   a hope that i had to give up  if i attributed reality to the muddled nightmares i had just experienced  to cross  above all  it was necessary to design a logical experiment   experimentum crucis   which would reveal that i had really gone mad  that i was the victim of the mirages of my imagination  or that  despite their absurd improbability  i had experienced events real  thinking  i looked at the rail that led to the launch pad  it was a steel beam  sprung from the wall  painted pale green and lined with curved metal plates  in a few places  a meter above the ground  the varnish was peeling  worn by the friction of the trolleys transporting the rockets  i touched the steel  i warmed it under my fingers  i hit the flattened top of the armour  could delirium reach such a degree of reality  yes  i answered to myself  after all  it was my field  i knew the matter  but was it possible to design a key experience  no  i tell myself at first  its impossible  because my sick brain  if it is really sick  will create the illusions that i will demand of it  in the most banal sleep  without being sick  we converse with strangers  to whom we ask questions and whose answers we hear  moreover  although our interlocutors are in reality the creations of our own psychic activity  forged by a pseudo independent process  until these interlocutors speak to us  we do not know what words will escape their lips  yet these words were formulated by a separate part of our mind  we should  therefore  know them the very moment we elaborate them to place them in the mouths of fictitious beings  also  whatever my project of experience  and in whatever way i put it into execution  i will always be able to estimate that i behave exactly as in my dream  snaut or sartorius having no real existence  it would be futile to ask them any questions  i had the idea of taking a powder  some powerful drug  peyote  for example  or some other preparation causing colored hallucinations  if visions ensued  it would prove that i had truly experienced the recent events and that they related to the surrounding material reality  and then no  i thought  that wouldnt be the desirable key experience  since i knew the effects of the drug  which i would have to choose myself   and my imagination could suggest to me the double illusion of having taken this drug and experiencing its effects  i went around in circles  the circle always closed  there was no way out  you couldnt think otherwise than with your brain  you couldnt see yourself from the outside in order to check the proper functioning of your internal processes  suddenly  a thought struck me  as simple as it is effective  i jumped to my feet and ran to the radio booth  the room was deserted  i glanced at the electric clock on the wall  almost four oclock  the agreed fourth hour of the night inside the station  outside  the red sun shone  i quickly plugged in the long range transmitter and  as the lamps warmed up  i mentally reviewed the main steps of the experiment  i didnt remember the call signal to which the satelloids automatic station responded  i found it on a piece of cardboard  hanging above the central control panel  i sent the call in morse code and the answer came eight seconds later  the satelloid  that is to say its electronic brain  announced itself by a rhythmic signal  i commanded the satelloid to let me know which interstellar meridians of the galaxy it passed through at twenty two second intervals as it circled solaris  and demanded fractions of five digits  then i sat down and waited for the answer  she came to me after ten minutes  i tore off the strip of freshly printed paper and hid it in a drawer  being careful not to look at it   i took out of the library large maps of the sky  tables of logarithms  a calendar defining the daily route of the satellite  as well as a few auxiliary books  then i set out to find the answer to the question i had asked  for a good hour  i lined up the equations  for a long time  since the time of my studies  i had not indulged in such calculations  when was my last performance  on the practical astronomy exam  no doubt  i carried out the operations with the help of the stations huge calculator  my reasoning was as follows  by carrying out my calculations according to the sky charts  i will obtain an approximate cross check of the results provided by the satelloid  approximate  because the path of the satelloid is subject to very complicated variations  due to the action of the gravitational forces of solaris and its two suns  also due to localized gravitational deviations caused by the ocean  when i have the two series of figures  one provided by the satelloid and the other calculated theoretically from the sky chart  i will bring corrections to my operations  then  the two groups will overlap up to the fourth decimal place  differences will remain only at the fifth  due to the unpredictable action of the ocean  if the figures obtained from the satelloid are not a reality  but the product of my wandering mind  there will be no possible cross check with the second series  i said to myself  my brain may be sick  but it cannot  under any circumstances  compete with the stations great calculator and secretly perform calculations that would have required several months of work  therefore  if the numbers match  the stations great calculator really exists  ive actually used it  and im not delusional  my hands were shaking as i took the telegraph tape out of the drawer and spread it out beside the wide strip of paper from the computer  the two sets of numbers matched  as i had expected  down to the fourth decimal place  the differences did not appear until the fifth  i hid all the papers in the drawer  so the calculator existed independently of me  it meant that the station  with its inhabitants  really existed  i was about to close the drawer when i noticed that it was stuffed with sheets  covered with calculations impatiently scribbled  a single glance revealed to me that someone had already tried an experiment similar to mine and asked the satelloid  not for information concerning the interstellar meridians  but for measurements of the albedo of solaris at intervals of forty seconds    i was not crazy  the last ray of hope faded  i unplugged the transmitter  i drank the broth that remained at the bottom of the heat insulated bottle and i went to bed
