     is it because of this experience  the sound of his voice came to me in surprise  i stiffened  lying in the dark  i was not asleep  i had not closed my eyes  for many hours  not hearing her breath  i had forgotten her  lonely  i had allowed myself to be carried away by the confused current of nocturnal thoughts  pursuing the delirium of my waking dream  i had lost sight of the exact measure and meaning of reality    what    how do you know im not sleeping    when youre asleep  you breathe differently   she said softly  as if to make amends for her remark  i didnt want to disturb you    if you cant answer me  dont answer      why shouldnt i be able to talk  yes  you guessed it  its this experiment    what do they expect from it    they dont know themselves  something  anything  its not  operation thinking   its  operation despair   the truth is that one of us would have to have the courage to cancel the experiment and take responsibility for the decision  but most of us believe that such courage is nothing more than fear  and that to cancel the experience is to signal retreat  renunciation  a flight unworthy of man  as if it were worthy of man to wade  to get bogged down  to drown in what he does not understand and will never understand    i stopped  but almost immediately a new fit of anger erupted    of course  they are not short of arguments  they claim that even if we dont succeed in making contact  we wont have wasted our time studying this plasma   all those living cities that emerge all the time 

 they claim that even if we dont succeed in making contact  we wont have wasted our time studying this plasma   all these living cities that emerge all day long and disappear   and that we will eventually unlock the secret of matter  they know perfectly well that they are fooling themselves  that they are walking through a library where all the books are written in an incomprehensible language and where only the colour of the bindings is recognisable    are there no other planets like this one    maybe    we dont know  this is the only one we know  in any case  it is an extremely rare species   not like the earth  earth is a common species   the grass of the universe    and we boast of this universality  we imagine that nothing can remain foreign to us  with this idea  bold and joyful  we set out for other worlds  and what were we going to do with these other worlds  to dominate them or to be dominated by them  that was the only thing on our unfortunate minds  ah  what useless pain  what useless pain    i got up  i groped about in the medicine chest  my fingers recognised the broad  flat bottle containing the sleeping pills  i turned around in the darkness   im going to sleep  dear    under the ceiling the fan was humming    i must sleep  i must    i sat down on the bed    touched my hand  i leaned forward and took   in my arms  and we lay there motionless  pressed against each other  i fell asleep  in the morning i woke up fresh and rested  the experience seemed a small matter to me  i could not understand how i could have attributed such importance to my encephalogram  nor did i care that i had to bring   into the laboratory  in spite of all her efforts  she could not bear to remain more than five minutes without seeing and hearing me  so i had given up trying  she was even prepared to let herself be locked up somewhere  and  in asking her to accompany me  i advised her to take a book with her  i was especially curious about what i would find in the laboratory  the appearance of the big blue and white room did not seem to be very attractive 

 the appearance of the large blue and white room was nothing special  except that the shelves and cupboards for storing the glass instruments seemed sparsely furnished  the panel of one glass door was slit in a star shape  and some doors had no panel at all  these details suggested that a fight had recently taken place here  the traces of which had been removed as far as possible     who was working at a machine  behaved quite properly  he showed no surprise at seeing   enter and bowed slightly to her  i was lying down and   was moistening my temples and forehead with saline  when a small door opened and   emerged from an unlit room  he was dressed in a white coat and a black radiation apron  which fell to his ankles  he greeted me authoritatively  looking very professional  as if we were in some great institute on earth  two researchers among hundreds of other scientists  carrying on the work of the veil  his dark glasses were gone  but i noticed that he was wearing contact lenses  and i thought i could explain the inexpressive look  with his arms crossed over his chest    was watching    who had put the electrodes in place and was wrapping a white band around my head  several times   looked around the room  he ignored    curled up on top of a stool  leaning against a wall  she pretended to read her book    stepped back  and i moved my head  laden with metal discs and wires  to watch him make contact  but   raised his hand and spoke angrily   dr     i ask you for a moments attention and concentration  i do not intend to dictate to you any precise thought process  for that would distort the experiment  but i insist that you stop thinking about yourself  about me  about our colleague    or about anyone else  strive to eliminate all intrusions of definite personalities and concentrate on the business that has brought us here  earth and

 solaris  the body of scholars as a whole  though generations have succeeded one another and man as an individual has a limited existence  our aspirations and perseverance in making intellectual contact  the long historical journey of mankind  the certainty that we shall continue that progress  our determination to renounce all personal feelings in order to accomplish our mission  the sacrifices we are prepared to make  the difficulties we are about to overcome    these are a series of themes that should be fed into your consciousness  the association of ideas does not depend entirely on your will  however  the very fact that you are here guarantees the authenticity of the development i have just presented  if you are not sure that you have done your job  please say so  and our colleague   will start the recording again  as he said these last words  he gave a small  dry smile  but his eyes remained gloomy  i was trying to unravel the pompous phrases he had thrown at me with the utmost seriousness    broke the prolonged silence   shall we go     his elbow was on the control panel of the electroencephalograph and he seemed to be leaning casually on the back of a chair  i liked his confident tone  and was grateful that he had called me by my first name  i closed my eyes and said   lets go  when   had fixed the electrodes and approached the control panel  a sudden anxiety had oppressed me  now this anxiety dissipated just as suddenly  through my lowered eyelashes i could see the red glow of the control lamps on the blackboard of the machine  i could no longer feel the wet  unpleasant touch of the metal electrodes  the crown of cold medals around my head  my mind was a grey  empty arena  surrounded by a crowd of invisible spectators  massed on bleachers  attentive to my

 silence   and from that silence emanated an ironic contempt for   and the mission  what was i going to improvise for all these inner spectators       i put his name forward uneasily  ready to withdraw it at once  but there was no protest  i persevered  i became intoxicated with tenderness and pain  i was prepared to endure long sacrifices patiently      filled me completely  she had no body  no face  she breathed in me  real and imperceptible  suddenly  as if superimposed on this desperate presence  i saw in the grey half light the learned and professorial face of giese  the father of solaristics and solarists  i did not think of the muddy eruption  the nauseating abyss that had swallowed up his golden spectacles and carefully brushed moustache  i saw the engraving on the title page of the monograph  the tight pencil strokes with which the draughtsman had haloed the head  a head that so closely resembled my fathers   not in features  but in the expression of ancient wisdom and honesty   that finally i no longer knew which of the two was looking at me  my father or giese  they were dead  neither of them had been buried   but in our time the unburied are not rare  the image of giese vanished  and for a moment i forgot the station  the experiment     the black ocean  immediate memories vanished before the overwhelming certainty that these two men  my father and giese  now turned to dust  had once faced all the events of their lives  and from this certainty i drew a deep peace  which annihilated the shapeless crowd massed around the grey arena in anticipation of my defeat  i heard the click of switches  the light of the lamps penetrated my eyelids  i blinked    had not moved  he was watching me     with his back to me  was snooping about the apparatus  and it seemed to me that he was enjoying the clacking of the sandals which slipped off his feet    do you think  dr     that the first stage of the experiment has been successful   asked   in that nasal voice i hated    yes  i do 

   are you sure   he insisted with some surprise  and perhaps even distrust    yes  i am  for a brief moment  my assurance and the harsh tone of my answer triumphed over his stiffness    ah    well   he stammered  looking distraught    came over to me and began to unravel the bands around my head    stepped back  hesitated  then disappeared into the dark room  i was stretching my legs when   reappeared  holding the already developed and dried film in his hand  trembling lines drew a white lace on fifteen metres of shiny black tape  my presence was no longer needed  but i stayed    inserted the film into the oxidised head of the modulator     with a sad and wary eye  looked once more at the end of the tape  as if trying to decipher the contents of those vibrating lines  there was nothing spectacular about the start of the experiment    and   each sat at a control panel and operated buttons  through the shielded floor i heard the muffled rumble of current in the coils  the light lines fell along the glass tubes of the counters  signifying that the body of the huge x ray gun was descending to the opening of the shaft that housed it  the light lines stopped at the minima    raised the voltage  the white arrow on the voltmeter moved in a semicircle from left to right  now the hum of the current was barely audible  the film was running  unseen under two spherical covers  numbers jumped with a slight tinkle in the footage indicator  i approached    who was looking at us over her book  she glanced at me quizzically  the experiment had just finished    was walking towards the big conical head of the apparatus   s lips drew a silent question   are we leaving 

 i answered in the affirmative    stood up  without taking leave of anyone  we left the room  a wonderful twilight lit up the windows of the corridor on the upper floor  the horizon was not russet and gloomy  as usual at this hour  but a shimmering pink  spangled with silver  under the soft caress of the light  the dark valleys of the ocean had soft purple reflections  the sky was red only at its zenith  when we reached the bottom of the stairs  i stopped  i could not bear the thought that we were to be shut up in my cabin again  as in a prison cell         i would like to see something in the library    do you mind  with somewhat forced animation she exclaimed   oh  no  ill find some reading material    i was aware that since the day before  a gap had opened up between us  i should have been more cordial  overcome my apathy  but where could i find the strength to shake off this torpor  we went down the ramp that led to the library  in the small hallway there were three doors and flowers under crystal globes set against the walls  i opened the middle door  which was covered on both sides with synthetic leather   when i entered the library i always avoided touching this padding  a pleasant breath of fresh air greeted me  the large circular room  despite the stylised sun painted on the ceiling  had not warmed up  distractedly caressing the spines of the books  i was about to choose  among all the solaris classics  the first volume of giese  in order to review the portrait on the title page  when i discovered by chance gravinskys work  an in  octavo with a cracked binding  which i had not noticed before  i sat down in an upholstered chair     sitting next to me  was leafing through a book  i could hear her turning the pages  gravinskys compendium  which students usually consulted as an aide memoire  was an alphabetical classification of solarist hypotheses  the compiler  who had never seen solaris  had stripped away all the

 the compiler  who had never seen solaris  had combed through all the monographs  expedition reports  fragmentary overviews and provisional papers  he had even fished out quotations from the works of planetologists studying other globes  he had written an inventory in which simplistic formulations abounded  grossly reducing the subtleties of the original thought  the work  conceived with encyclopaedic pretensions  was now little more than a curiosity  gravinskys compendium had appeared twenty years earlier  but since then so many new hypotheses had accumulated that a single book would not have been enough to contain them  i went through the index  which was almost an obituary list  for a small number of the authors mentioned were still alive  of those who survived  none was still actively involved in solarist studies  reading all these names  measuring the amount of intellectual effort exerted in all directions  one could not help thinking that at least one of the hypotheses formulated must be right  and that the thousands of hypotheses put forward must each contain some shred of truth   that reality could not be entirely different  in his introduction  gravinsky divided the first sixty years of solarist studies into periods  during the initial period   which began with the expedition sent to reconnoitre the planet   no one had  strictly speaking  formulated any hypotheses  common sense  then intuitively accepted that the ocean was a lifeless chemical conglomerate  a gelatinous mass  which by its  quasi volcanic  activity produced marvellous creations and stabilised its unstable orbit by a self generating mechanical process  in the same way that a pendulum maintains itself on a fixed plane after being set in motion  in fact  three years after the first expedition  magenon had put forward the idea that the colloidal machine was alive  but gravinskys period of biological hypotheses did not begin until nine years later  when magenons previously discarded opinion had gained many supporters  the following years were full of highly complex theoretical descriptions of the living ocean  supported by

 biomathematical analysis  during the third period  the opinion of the scientists  which had been more or less unanimous until then  became divided  a host of rival schools arose and fought furiously  this was the era of panmaller  strobel  freyhouss  le greuille  osipowicz  the whole legacy of giese was subjected to merciless criticism  the first atlases and inventories appeared  stereophotographs of asymmetriads  until recently considered impossible creations to explore  were presented   new remote controlled instruments had been introduced inside these formidable behemoths  which could be torn apart by an unpredictable explosion at any moment  in the tumult of the discussions  the minimal hypotheses were dismissed with contempt  even if we could not make that famous contact with the reasonable monster  some felt  it was worthwhile to study the cartilaginous cities of the mimoids and the blown up mountains on the surface of the ocean  for we could gain valuable chemical and physicochemical knowledge and enrich our experiments in the structure of giant molecules  but no one deigned to engage in controversy with the proponents of such theses  inventories of typical metamorphoses were being compiled  catalogues whose authority survives today  and frank was developing his bioplasmatic theory of mimoids   although it turned out to be inaccurate  it remains a superb example of intellectual impetuosity and logical construction  these first three gravinsky periods   thirty odd years   this candid assurance  this irresistibly optimistic romanticism  was the youth of solaristics  already  with scepticism  the mature age was coming  towards the end of the first quarter of the century  the old colloidomechanical hypotheses had found a distant descendant in the theory of the apsychic ocean  opinion was almost unanimous in judging the viewpoint of a whole generation of scientists  who had believed that they were observing the manifestations of a conscious will  teleological processes  an activity

 motivated by some inner necessity of the ocean  the press  in passionately refuting this view  cleared the field for the holden  eonides and stoliwa team  whose lucid  analytically sound speculations focused on a careful examination of ever accumulating data  this was the golden age of the archivist  microfilm libraries abounded  expeditions  some with more than a thousand members  were lavishly equipped with all the sophisticated equipment the earth could provide   automatic recorders  probes  detectors  but as the materials accumulated at an ever increasing rate  the very spirit of the research became bogged down and  during this still optimistic period  a decline began  courageous men such as giese  strobel and sevada  who were daring in their affirmation or negation of a theoretical conception  had left their mark on this first phase of solaristics  sevada  the last of the great solarists  disappeared inexplicably near the planets south pole  apparently  he was the victim of an imprudence that even a novice would not have committed  hovering at low altitude over the ocean  in front of a hundred observers  he had flown his plane into an agilus  which was not in his way  there was talk of a sudden weakness  a fainting spell  a failure of the control system  in reality  in my opinion  this was the first suicide  a first and sudden crisis of despair  there were other crises  but gravinskys book did not mention them  contemplating the yellowed pages  covered with tight print  i found in myself the facts  the dates  the details that i knew  later on  moreover  the manifestations of despair were fortunately less violent   outstanding personalities were also rarer among scholars  the recruitment of scientists to study a particular field of planetology has never been studied as a phenomenon in itself  each generation has a roughly constant number of men with brilliant minds and great

 of character  only the paths they take differ  the presence or absence of such men in a given sector of research is undoubtedly explained by the perspectives that this sector opens up for the scientific process  the researchers of the classical solaristic era can be appreciated in different ways  but no one can deny their greatness  even their genius  for a few decades  the mysterious ocean had attracted the best mathematicians  the best physicists  the most eminent specialists in biophysics  information theory and electrophysiology  and suddenly the army of researchers seemed to be leaderless  there remained a grey and anonymous crowd of patient  collectors   of compilers  skilled in imagining a few original experiments  but there was no longer any succession of vast expeditions conceived on the scale of the entire globe  and no more high profile hypotheses  stimulating by their audacity  were stirring up the scientific community  the monument of solaristics was deteriorating  like moss eating away at stone  hypotheses multiplied  differentiated only in secondary details  and unanimously embroidering on the theme of the degeneration  regression and involution of the ocean  from time to time  a bolder and more interesting conception would stand out from the mass  but always it was a sort of condemnation of the ocean  the final product of a development that had long before   thousands of years before   passed through a phase of superior organisation  the ocean now had only a physical unity and its multiple  useless  absurd creations were bursts of agony   a fantastic agony  to be sure  that had been continuing for centuries  thus  the longus or the mimoids were tumours  all the processes observed on the surface of the enormous fluid body expressed chaos and anarchy    this way of considering the problem became an obsession  for seven or eight years  the learned literature poured out in courteous terms assertions which were  in spite of the oratorical precautions  nothing but a heap of insults   the revenge of a crowd of misguided solarists  deprived of leaders  against the object of their assiduous care  which did not depart from

 indifference and stubbornly ignored all advances  a team of european psychologists had carried out a survey of public opinion over an extended period of time  their report  indirectly related to solaristics  was not among the books in the stations library  but i had studied it and remembered it well  by systematically collecting lay statements  the investigators had demonstrated in a striking way that changes in popular opinion followed very closely the fluctuations of opinion recorded in scholarly circles  in the coordinating commission of the planetological institute  which decided on material support for research  the change was manifested in a gradual reduction in the institutes budgets and in the number of posts devoted to solar science  as well as in restrictions on the exploration teams  some scientists  however  had taken the complete opposite position and were calling for more energetic action  the administrative director of the universal cosmological institute went so far as to assert stubbornly that the living ocean did not disdain humans  but had not noticed them   just as an elephant neither sees nor feels the ants that wander on its back  to attract the oceans attention and keep it there for a long time  powerful stimuli and gigantic machines designed to the size of the entire planet were needed  a piquant detail  which the press mischievously pointed out  was that the director of the cosmological institute generously invited people to dip into their pockets  since it was the planetological institute that should have financed these costly expeditions  hypotheses continued to pour in   old ones refreshed  superficially modified  simplified or over complicated   and solaristics  a relatively clear discipline despite its breadth  became an increasingly tangled labyrinth  where every apparent exit ended in a dead end  in a climate of

 of general indifference  stagnation and discouragement  the ocean of solaris was being covered with an ocean of printed paper  two years before i began my internship in the laboratory of the department headed by     at the end of which i had graduated from the institute   the mettirving foundation  recently created for this sole purpose  promised the highest rewards to anyone who could find a way to use the oceans energy  the idea was not new  cosmic ships had already brought many a shipment of plasma jelly to earth  patiently  various methods of preservation had been tried  high and low temperatures  micro atmospheres and artificial microclimates  reproducing the atmospheric and climatic conditions of solaris  prolonged irradiation    a whole arsenal of physical and chemical procedures had been deployed  only to observe in the end  and invariably  a more or less slow process of decomposition  passing through stages that have been abundantly described  consomption  maceration  liquefaction in the first degree  known as primary  and late liquefaction  known as secondary  the samples taken from the plasma efflorescences and creations suffered an identical fate  with some variations in the decomposition process  but  in the final stage  the matter always dissipated by self fermentation into a light ash with metallic reflections  any solarist could  however  establish the composition of the matter under study  specify the ratios of the elements and the chemical characteristics  the scientists having recognised that it was impossible to keep alive   or even in a vegetative state  in  hibernation    any fragment  large or small  taken from the ocean and dissociated from the monstrous organism  the conviction was acquired  developed by the school of meunier and proroch  that the key to the mystery depended only on the way in which it was approached  and that when we had found the correct method of interpretation  the whole problem would be resolved  the search for this key  this philosophers stone of solaris  had absorbed the time and energy of a crowd of people generally lacking any scientific training  during

 during the fourth decade of solaristics  a veritable epidemic had spread  which had moved the psychologists  an incalculable number of maniacs  of ignorant obsessives  devoted themselves to their groping search  with a zeal that surpassed that of the ancient prophets of perpetual motion or of the squaring of the circle  this passion  however  was extinguished after a few years  by the time i was preparing to leave for solaris  the famous epidemic had long ceased to be mentioned in the newspapers or in conversations  where  moreover  there was little concern about the ocean  as i put gravinskys book back on its shelf   and i was careful to keep to the alphabetical order   i came across a thin pamphlet by grattenstrom  one of the most bizarre authors of solaristic literature  i knew the pamphlet  it was a pamphlet  driven by a concern to understand what is beyond man  and specifically directed against the individual  man  the human species   the abstract  snarky work of a self taught man  who had previously made a series of unusual contributions to some marginal  highly specialised areas of quantum physics  in this fifteen page booklet   and yet his most important work   the polemicist tried to demonstrate that the most abstract achievements of science  the most haughty theories  the highest mathematical conquests meant only a derisory progress  a step or two forward  compared to our prehistoric  crude  anthropomorphic understanding of the surrounding world  looking for the correspondents of the human body   the projections of our senses  of the structure of our organism  of the physiological conditions that limit man   in the formulas of the theory of relativity  in the theorem of magnetic fields  in parastatics  in the hypotheses concerning the unified field of the cosmos  grattenstrom had concluded that there was no question  and could never be a question  of any  contact  of man with an extra human civilisation  in this pamphlet against humanity  there was no mention of the living ocean  however  between the lines 

 one could feel its constant presence  its contemptuous and triumphant silence  such  at least  had been my impression on studying this pamphlet  which   had pointed out to me  and which he had certainly added on his own authority to the stations collection of classics   grattenstroms pamphlet being regarded as a curiosity  but not as a true solarianum  with a strange  reverent feeling  i carefully slid the thin pamphlet between the tightly packed books on the shelf  with my fingertips i caressed the bronze green binding of the solaris yearbook  in a few days  we had undoubtedly acquired certainty on some fundamental questions  which had caused so much ink to flow and fuelled so many arguments that remained sterile for lack of arguments  today  even though the mystery surrounded us on all sides  we had strong arguments  was the ocean a living creature  we could not continue to doubt it  unless we indulged in paradoxes or stubbornness  it was becoming impossible to deny the psychic functions of the ocean   whatever that term meant exactly  this alone invalidated the solarist theories that the ocean was an  inner world    a  recluse life    deprived by an involutive process of thought organs that had once existed  unaware of the existence of external objects and phenomena  trapped in a gigantic vortex of mental currents created and confined in the abysses of this monster rotating between two suns  better still  we had discovered that the ocean could reproduce what we ourselves had never managed to create by artificial synthesis   the human body  a perfected human body  modified in its infra atomic structure  in order to serve inconceivable purposes  the ocean lived  thought  acted  the  solaris problem  was not annihilated by its very absurdity  we were indeed dealing with a creature  the lost game was by no means lost    that seemed to be the final outcome  whether we like it or not

 willy nilly  men had to take into consideration this neighbour  from which they were separated by a void of trillions of kilometres and light years  a neighbour  however  situated in our expansion zone and more disturbing than the rest of the universe  perhaps we had reached a turning point in history    what decision would prevail in high places  would they order us to give up  to return to earth  immediately or in the near future  would they even order us to liquidate the station  it was not impossible  at least not implausible  i did not believe  however  in the escape solution  the existence of the thinking colossus would not cease to torment mankind  even if man had explored the cosmic spaces in all directions  even if he had established relations with other civilisations founded by creatures similar to ourselves  solaris would remain an eternal provocation  i discovered  lost among the thick volumes of the yearbook  a small skin bound book  i looked at the worn cover for a moment  it was an old book  the introduction to solaristics  by muntius  i had read it in one night     with a smile  had lent me his copy  and when i reached the word end  the dawn of a new day on earth lit up my window  solaristics  muntius wrote  is the religion substitute of the cosmic age  it is a faith  disguised as science  contact  the goal of solaristics  is no less vague and obscure than the communion of saints or the return of the messiah  exploration is a liturgy according to the formulas of the methodology  the humble work of the scientists is only the expectation of an accomplishment  of an annunciation  because there are not and cannot be any bridges between solaris and the earth  the comparison is obvious  the solarists reject the arguments   no common experiences  no transmissible notions   just as the believers rejected the arguments that undermined the foundations of their faith  besides  what can humans expect  what can they hope for from an information link with the living ocean  a catalogue of the vicissitudes associated with an infinite existence in time  and if

 that it probably has no memory of its origins  a description of the aspirations  passions  hopes and sufferings  which are released by the chronic creation of living mountains  the promotion of mathematics to embodied existence  the revelation of fulfilment in isolation and renunciation  but all of this represents untransferable knowledge  transposed into any human language  the values and meanings sought lose all substance   they cannot be passed across the barrier  the  adepts  do not expect such revelations   of the order of poetry  rather than science   because  unconsciously  it is revelation that they are waiting for  a revelation that would explain the meaning of mans destiny  solaristics resurrects myths that have long since disappeared  it expresses mystical nostalgia  which men no longer dare to express openly  the cornerstone  deeply buried in the foundations of the edifice  is the hope of redemption    unable to recognise this truth  the solarists cautiously avoid any interpretation of contact  presented in their works as a final outcome  whereas originally the lucid minds considered it as a beginning  an opening  a foray on a new path  among many other possible paths  over the years  contact has been sanctified   it has become the heaven of eternity  muntius analyses this heresy of planetology very simply  and bitterly  he brilliantly dismantles the solarist myth  or rather the myth of the mission of man  muntius work was the first discordant voice to be met with the disdainful silence of scholars  at a time when they still had a romantic confidence in the development of solaristics  how  indeed  could they have approved a thesis that denounced the very foundations of their work  solaristics continued to wait for someone who would firmly re establish its foundations and rigorously set its boundaries  five years after muntiuss death  when his book had become the white bird of bibliophiles   almost impossible to find 

 five years after muntius death  when his book had become a bibliophiles whitebird   almost impossible to find in both solariana and philosophy libraries   a group of norwegian scholars founded a school bearing the scholars name  in contact with the personalities of his various spiritual heirs  the masters serene thought underwent profound transformations  it led to the corrosive irony of erle ennesson and  on a lesser level  to phaelengs  utilitarian solaristics   or  utilitarianism   which recommended focusing on the immediate benefits that explorations could bring without worrying about any intellectual communion of two civilisations  any utopian contact  compared to muntius relentless and clear analysis  however  the works of his followers are little more than compilations  or even simple works of popularisation  with the exception of ennesons treatises  and perhaps takatas studies  muntius himself had already set out the full development of solaristic conceptions  he called the first phase of solaristics the era of the  prophets   among whom he counted giese  holden and sevada  he called the second phase the  great schism    the break up of the one solaristic church into a host of antagonistic chapels  he foresaw a third phase  which would come when all had been explored  and which would manifest itself in scholastic and sclerotic dogma  this prediction  however  was to prove inaccurate  in my opinion    was right when he called muntius attack a monumental simplification  neglecting everything in solaristics that was the opposite of a faith  since the work that was pursued unceasingly referred only to the material reality of a globe revolving around two suns  in muntiuss book i found a separate issue of the quarterly journal parerga solariana  yellowed leaves folded in two  one of the first articles written by    even before his appointment as head of the institute  the article  entitled why i am a solarist  began with a succinct enumeration of all the material phenomena that justify the chances of contact    belonged to that generation of researchers who had the audacity to revive the optimism of

   belonged to this generation of researchers  who had the audacity to revive the optimism of the golden age and did not deny a strong faith  going beyond the boundaries imposed by science  a concrete faith  since it implied the success of persevering efforts    had been influenced by the classical works of bioelectronics  to which the eurasian school   cho enmin  ngyalla  kawakadze   owed its fame  these studies established an analogy between the diagram of the brains electrical activity and certain discharges occurring within the plasma before the appearance of  for example  elementary polymorphs or twin solarydes    rejected the overly anthropomorphic interpretations  all the mystifications of the psychoanalytic  psychiatric and neurophysiological schools  which tried to discern in the ocean symptoms of human diseases  including epilepsy  to which the spasmodic eruptions of the asymmetriads were supposed to correspond   for  among the defenders of contact    was one of the most cautious and lucid  and condemned sensationalist declarations   which were  in fact  becoming increasingly rare  moreover  my own doctoral thesis had provoked some questionable interest  i was building on the findings of bergmann and reynolds  who had succeeded in isolating and filtering the components of the strongest emotions   despair  pain  pleasure   in a series of very diverse processes  i had systematically compared these recordings with the current discharges emitted by the ocean  i had observed oscillations and noted curves  in certain parts of symmetriads  at the base of forming mimoids  etc    revealing a noteworthy analogy  journalists were quick to seize on my name  which was attached by a certain press to grotesque titles such as  the desperate gelatin  or  the planet in orgasm   this troubled fame had  however  a happy consequence  such was my opinion only a few days before   i had attracted the attention of     who  of course  could not read the whole of the published solarist works   and he sent me a letter  with that letter  a chapter of my life ended  a new chapter began
