i followed a long deserted corridor  then turned right  i had never been on the station  but on earth  during training  i had lived for six weeks in the exact replica of the station  i knew where the small aluminium staircase led  the library was not lit  i groped for the switch  i consulted the map library  having dialled the numbers of the first volume of the yearbook of solarist studies and the supplement  i pressed the computer key  a red light came on  i looked at the register  both books were at gibarian  as well as the little apocrypha  i turned off the light and went back downstairs  despite the footsteps i had heard going away  i was afraid to go back to gibarian  she might come back  i stood behind the door for a long time  finally  pressing the handle  i forced myself to enter  there was no one in the room  i began to upset the books scattered in front of the window  interrupting my search for a moment to go and close the cupboard  i suffered to see the empty place among the combinations  the supplement was not under the window  and i began to methodically lift the books  one by one  all around the room  when i reached the last pile  between the bed and the wardrobe  i discovered the volume i was looking for  i hoped to find a mark  and indeed a bookmark was slipped between the pages of the index  a name  which i did not know  had been underlined in red pencil  andre berton  the numbers beside the name referred the reader to two different chapters  i glanced at the first reference and learned that berton was a reserve pilot on shannahans ship 

 the next reference appeared about a hundred pages later  at first the expedition acted with extreme caution  then  sixteen days having elapsed  it was found that the plasma ocean not only showed no signs of aggression  but shrank from direct contact with apparatus and men  recoiling whenever any body approached its surface  so shannahan and his deputy  timolis  dispensed with some of the precautions which were hindering and delaying the course of the work  the expedition then divided into small groups of two or three men  flying over the ocean in a radius  sometimes  of a few hundred miles  the radiation booms  previously used to delineate and protect the work  were transported to the base  four days passed without the slightest accident  except for some damage to the equipment supplying oxygen to the suits  the atmosphere was exceptionally corrosive to the valves  which had to be replaced almost daily  on the morning of the fifth day  the twenty first day since the arrival of the expedition  two scientists  carucci and fechner  the first was a radiobiologist  the second a physicist   set out to explore over the ocean  they sailed in an aeromobile   not a flying vehicle  but a glider  moving on a cushion of compressed atmosphere  six hours later  the two explorers had not returned  timolis  who was running the base in shannahans absence  raised the alarm and organised the search  calling in all available men  by a fatal twist of fate  the radio link that day had been cut off an hour after the away parties had left   a large blob had obscured the red sun  which was bombarding the upper layers of the atmosphere with a dense shot of energetic particles  only the ultra shortwave devices continued to operate  limiting contact to a radius of twenty or so miles 

 to make matters worse  the fog thickened before sunset and the search had to be called off  just as the rescue teams were returning to base  a helicopter found the airmobile just eighty miles from the command ship  the engine was running and the aircraft  apparently undamaged  was holding above the waves  in the translucent cabin there was only one man  half conscious   carucci  the aircraft was ferried back to the base  carucci received medical attention and quickly regained consciousness  he was unable to say anything about fechners disappearance  he only remembered that he himself had been suffocated when they had decided to return  the valve of his oxygen apparatus had disengaged and small amounts of toxic gas were entering the suit  fechner  trying to repair caruccis apparatus  had been forced to unhook his seatbelt and stand up  that was the last thing carucci remembered  in the opinion of the specialists  the sequence of events could be established  in order to repair caruccis aircraft  fechner had opened the roof of the cabin  as the low dome impeded his movements   a permissible procedure  as the cabin of these vehicles is not airtight and is merely a screen against atmospheric infiltration and the wind  while fechner was busy with his companion  his own oxygen apparatus had probably also been damaged  and fechner  not knowing what he was doing  had climbed to the top of the carcass  from where he had fallen into the ocean  fechner was thus the first victim of the ocean  a search was made for his body   the diving suit should have survived   but without success  perhaps the suit was floating somewhere  the expedition was not in a position to search meticulously in the vast expanse of an undulating desert  covered with shreds of mist  by dusk   ill pick up the story at the end of this twenty first day   all the rescuers vehicles had returned to the base  except for a large supply helicopter  in which berton had flown 

 bertons helicopter reappeared an hour after dark when there was serious concern  berton was clearly suffering from concussion  he broke free from his aircraft and immediately began to run around like a madman  he was restrained  he was screaming and crying  this was amazing  to say the least  for a man with seventeen years of cosmic navigation under his belt and who had flown more than one flight in very difficult conditions  the doctors assumed that berton  too  had absorbed poisonous gases  however  having regained some semblance of equilibrium  berton refused to leave the interior of the base  even for a moment  or even to go near the window overlooking the ocean  after two days  he asked permission to dictate a report on his flight  insisting on the importance of the revelations he was about to make  the expedition council studied the report and concluded that it was the morbid creation of a mind intoxicated by the noxious gases of the atmosphere  the alleged revelations were of interest  not to the history of the expedition  but to the development of bertons disease  and so it was deemed unnecessary to mention them  this is what the supplement said  i thought that bertons report must hold the key to the mystery   what could have shaken a veteran space flyer so badly  i again set about shaking up the books  but the little apocrypha was nowhere to be found  i felt increasingly tired  so i postponed further research until the next day and left the room  as i passed the foot of a staircase  i saw spots of light spread from the top to the bottom of the aluminium steps  sartorius was still working  i decided to go and see him  upstairs it was warmer  there was a slight draught  however  and the paper strips were waving frantically at the ventilation grates  the corridor was low and wide  a thick plate of frosted glass  in a chrome embrasure  closed off the main laboratory  inside  a dark curtain veiled the door  light fell from windows pierced above the lintel  i pressed the handle  the door did not give way   i had anticipated this  no other sound came from the

 no sound came from the laboratory but an intermittent chirping   like the hiss of a faulty gas burner  i knocked  there was no answer  i called    sartorius  dr  sartorius  its me  kelvin  the new guy  i need to see you  please  open up  there was a rustle of crumpled papers    its me  kelvin  youve heard of me  i arrived from the prometheus a few hours ago    i shouted  my lips pressed into the corner where the door stuck to the metal jamb    dr sartorius  i am alone  please  open up  not a word  then the same rustling as before  then the clatter of steel instruments being placed on a tray  then    i couldnt believe my ears    a series of tiny steps  the trotting of a child  the tight  hurried stomping of a pair of tiny legs  were remarkably nimble fingers imitating this gait as they tapped the lid of an empty box  i shouted   dr  sartorius  are you going to open it or not  there was no answer  only the scampering of a child and  at the same time  the footsteps of a man walking on tiptoe  but if this man was moving  he could not at the same time imitate a childs walk  i could no longer contain my rage and burst out   dr  sartorius  i did not undertake a sixteen month journey to come and amuse myself with your comedies  i count to ten  if you dont open the door  ill break it down  i doubted  moreover  that i could easily break down this door    and the discharge of a gas pistol is not very powerful  yet i was determined to carry out my threat  one way or another  even if i had to resort to explosives  of which i would no doubt find plenty in the warehouse shops  i could not afford to give in  that is to say  i could not continue to play a fools game with the rigged cards that the situation put in my hand 


 there was a sound of struggle  or just objects being pushed away  the curtain parted in the middle and a slender shadow was cast on the frosted glass  which the light froze around  a hoarse  high pitched voice spoke    i will open  but you must promise not to come in    in that case  why open up    ill come out    ill come out  i promise  the figure stepped back and the curtain was carefully closed  confused operations were going on inside the laboratory  i heard scratching   was it a table scraping the floor  at last the lock clicked  the glass panel swung open and sartorius slipped into the corridor  he leaned against the door  he was very tall  skinny  bony under his whitish knitwear  around his neck he had tied a black scarf  on his arm  folded in half  he wore a laboratory coat  burnt by the reagents  his head  extraordinarily narrow  was tilted to one side  i couldnt see his eyes  dark  arched glasses covered half his face  his lower jaw was elongated  he had blue lips and huge  bluish ears  he had not shaved  radiation proof gloves  red gloves  tied with laces  hung from his wrists  we stared at each other for a while with undisguised dislike  his shaggy hair  he had obviously shorn it himself  was the colour of lead  the beard was growing back salt and pepper  like snaut  he had a burnt forehead  but only halfway up  and pallid above a horizontal line  he must have been wearing some kind of cap when he was out in the sun    im listening   he said  i had the impression that he didnt care what i had to say  tense and always glued to the glass plate  he was mostly attentive to what was happening behind him  for fear of blurting out something stupid  i didnt know what to say at first  i began 


   my name is kelvin    you have certainly heard of me  i am  or rather i was  gibarians collaborator  his thin  vertical face   thats how i imagined don quixote   was devoid of expression  and the black mask didnt help me find the words    i learned that gibarian    was dead    i interrupted myself    i interrupted  im listening  the voice betrayed impatience    did he kill himself  who found the body  you or snaut    why are you coming to me  didnt dr  snaut give you any information    i wanted to hear what you had to say about the case    youve studied psychology  dr  kelvin  havent you    yes  well    do you serve science    yes  of course i do  whats that got to do with    youre not a police commissioner or a detective  its now two forty and  instead of devoting yourself to your task  to the work that has been assigned to you here  not content with breaking into my laboratory  you question me as if i were a suspect  sweat was pouring from his forehead  i struggled to control myself and  with a choked voice  said   you are a suspect  dr  sartorius  i tried to reach him at all costs and added angrily   besides  you know that    kelvin  if you dont retract your statement and apologise to me  ill report you to the police    why should i apologise to you  because you lock yourself away in this laboratory instead of coming to greet me  instead of honestly telling me what is going on here  have you completely lost your mind  and you  yes  who are you  a scientist or a miserable capon  answer me 

 i dont know what i was shouting again  he did not even flinch  big drops were running down his cheeks with dilated pores  suddenly i understood  he hadnt heard me  with both hands behind his back  he held the door  which was swinging as if someone on the other side had pulled the panel  in a strange  high pitched voice he moaned   go away  i beg you  for gods sake  go away  ill come down and join you  ill do anything you want  but i beg you  go away  his voice betrayed such exhaustion that i reached out mechanically to help him hold that door  and he gave a howl of horror as if i had pointed a knife at him  i began to back away  while he shouted in his falsetto voice   go  go  im coming back  im coming back  im coming back  no  no   he opened the door and rushed in  it seemed to me that a yellow object  a glowing disc  had shone for a moment across his chest  now there was a dull murmur from the laboratory  the curtain flew aside  a great shadow was cast on the glass screen  then the curtain fell and i saw nothing  what was going on in the room  footsteps struck the floor  there was a mad chase  followed by a terrific crash of glass  and i heard a childs laughter    my legs wobbled  i looked at the door with a haggard eye  the noise had been replaced by silence  i sat down on the plastic edge of a window  i sat there for maybe a quarter of an hour  i dont know  waiting for something  or just so stunned that i didnt want to get up  my head was bursting  i heard a continuous creak and more light shone on the landing  from where i sat i could only see part of the circular corridor that surrounded the laboratory  it was situated at the top of the station  under the very shell of the upper frame  so the walls were concave and sloping  with oblong windows a few metres apart  the outer shutters were going up  the blue day was coming to an end  a blinding glare

 through the thick glass  every nickel plated rod  every latch flashed  the laboratory door   that great panel of rough glass   flashed with pale sparks  i looked down at my hands  which had turned grey in the spectral light  my right hand held the gas pistol   i hadnt realised it  i didnt know id taken the pistol out of its sheath  i sheathed it  i knew now that even a radioactive lance would not have helped me much  what good would it have done me  to attack the door  to storm the laboratory  i stood up  the solar disk  like a hydrogen explosion  was sinking into the ocean and penetrating me with a jet of horizontal  almost tangible rays  when the rays hit my cheek  i was descending the stairs   i felt them like a burning imprint  in the middle of the staircase i stopped to think and climbed the stairs again  i went round the laboratory  as i have said  the corridor encircled it completely  and after a hundred steps i found myself in front of a second glass door  exactly the same as the other  i did not try to open it  i knew it was locked  i scanned the wall  looking for a window  a slot of some kind  the idea of spying on sartorius had come to me quite naturally and without shame  i wanted to put an end to the suppositions and find out the truth  a truth that i had imagined incomprehensible in advance  it occurred to me that the laboratory rooms were illuminated by ceiling windows at the top of the shell surrounding the station  so it would be possible to spy on sartorius from the outside  to begin with  i had to go downstairs and don a suit and an oxygen apparatus  at the top of the stairs i hesitated  those snuff boxes were probably frosted glass slabs  but i wanted to see the laboratory  and there was no other option    i returned to the middle floor  the door to the radio booth was open  snaut  slumped in his chair  was sleeping  at the sound of my footsteps he jumped up and opened his eyes    hi  kelvin   he said in a hoarse voice 

 as i remained silent  he asked   so  have you learned anything    yes    hes not alone  snaut grinned   oh  really  ah  indeed  thats something  does he have visitors  almost involuntarily  i replied   i dont understand why you wont tell me what its about  since im staying here  sooner or later ill learn the truth  why these mysteries    when you yourself have had visitors  you will understand  it seemed to me that my presence bothered him and that he did not want to continue the conversation  i went out    where are you going  i did not answer  the space station was just as i had left it  my burnt out capsule stood gaping on its base  i approached the locker room where the spacesuits were lined up  but suddenly i lost interest in this escapade on the surface of the shell  i turned around and went down a spiral staircase  which led to the storage rooms  downstairs  stacked bottles and crates filled the narrow hallway  bare metal plates with bluish highlights lined the walls  a few dozen more steps  and under an archway appeared the frosted pipes of the refrigeration plant  at the end of the corridor they ran into a sleeve with a wide plastic collar  when i opened the heavy  two inch thick  foam insulated door  a cold chill entered me  i shivered  i was standing at the threshold of a cave carved into an ice floe  with carved reliefs in the shape of large coils  from which ice stalactites hung  here too  buried under a layer of snow  were crates  space capsules  side shelves were loaded with translucent boxes and bags containing an oily yellow material  the

 the vault was lowering  a frosty curtain hid the bottom of the cave  i drew aside the curtain  a large  elongated body  covered with canvas  lay on an aluminium grid  i lifted the edge of the sheet and saw gibarians frozen face  the straight black hair  with a grey streak through it  stuck tightly to the skull  the cartilage of the throat jutted out in a ridge in the middle of the neck  the dull eye stared at the arch  a tear of opaque ice hanging from the corner of the eyelids  the cold was so brutal that i had to grit my teeth to keep them from chattering  supporting the shroud with one hand  i touched gibarians cheek with the other  i thought i was touching a petrified wooden log  bristling with black  prickly hair  the curve of the lips expressed an infinite  disdainful patience  letting go of the cloth  i noticed five black beads protruding from between the folds  arranged in order of size  i stiffened  i recognised fingers  the oval pulp of the toes of a naked foot  under the crumpled shroud  flattened against gibarians body  lay the black woman  slowly i pulled back the sheet  the head was covered with frizzy hair  twisted into little tufts  and rested on a massive black arm  the back gleamed  stretched to the edge of the vertebrae  there was no movement in this colossal body  i examined the soles of the bare feet again and found that they were not flattened or deformed by the weight they must have borne  that the skin had not hardened from walking  and was as intact and soft as the skin of the hands or shoulders  with more difficulty than i had experienced in touching gibarians corpse  i forced myself to touch one of these bare feet  then i made another implausible observation  this body  abandoned in a freezer  this body was alive and moving  the woman had withdrawn her foot  like a sleeping dog whose paw someone has tried to grab  i thought confusedly   she will freeze      but the body  now peaceful again  was warm and i had felt the steady beat of the pulse in the pads of the toes  i stepped back  the curtain fell and i left in a hurry 


 as i left the white cave  the heat seemed stifling  i followed the corridor and climbed the stairs  which took me back to the space station  i sat on the rings of a rolled up parachute  i held my head in my hands  i was stunned  my thoughts were escaping  i couldnt hold them back  they were sliding down a steep hill    what was happening to me  if my mind was going to collapse  i might as well lose consciousness right away  the idea of immediate annihilation awakened an inexpressible hope   unattainable  there was no point in going to snaut or sartorius  no one could fully appreciate what i had experienced  what i had seen  what i had touched with my own hands  there was only one explanation  only one way out  madness  yes  i had gone mad as soon as i arrived here  the emanations of the ocean had attacked my brain  the hallucinations followed one another  i should not waste my strength trying to solve illusory riddles  but ask for a doctors help  radio the prometheus or some other ship  send an s o s  an unexpected change took place in me  at the thought that i had gone mad  i calmed down  i had clearly heard snauts words    if snaut existed and if i had ever spoken with him  the hallucinations could have started much earlier  perhaps i had been on board the prometheus  a mental illness had suddenly overtaken me and i was confronting the creations of my irritated brain  assuming that i was ill  i was allowed to believe that i would recover  which gave me hope of deliverance   a hope i had to give up  if i attributed reality to the confused nightmares i had just gone through  above all  it was necessary to devise a logical experiment   experimentum crucis   which would reveal that i had really gone mad  that i was a victim of the mirages of my imagination  or that  despite their absurd implausibility  i had experienced real events 


 reflecting  i looked at the rail that led to the launch pad  it was a steel beam  jutting out from the wall  painted pale green and lined with curved metal plates  in some places  a metre above the ground  the varnish was peeling  worn away by the friction of the rocket carts  i touched the steel  warmed it under my fingers  hit the flattened top of the armour  could delirium reach such a degree of reality  yes  i answered to myself  after all  this was my field  i knew the question  but was it possible to design a key experiment  no  i thought at first  it was impossible  for my sick brain  if it is really sick  will create the illusions i demand of it  in the most ordinary sleep  without being ill  we talk to strangers  ask them questions and hear their answers  moreover  although our interlocutors are in reality the creations of our own psychic activity  forged by a pseudo independent process  until these interlocutors have spoken to us  we do not know what words will escape from their lips  yet these words have been formulated by a distinct part of our mind  we should  therefore  know them at the very moment we elaborate them in order to place them in the mouths of fictional beings  therefore  whatever my plan of experiment  and however i carry it out  i shall always be able to consider that i am behaving exactly as in a dream  since snaut or sartorius have no real existence  it would be futile to ask them any questions  i had the idea of absorbing a powder  some powerful drug  peyote  for example  or some other preparation causing coloured hallucinations  if visions followed  it would prove that i had really experienced the recent events and that they were related to the surrounding material reality  and no  i thought  this would not be the desirable key experiment  since i knew the effects of the drug  which i would have to choose for myself   and my imagination could suggest the double illusion of having taken the drug and experiencing its effects 

 i was going round and round in circles  always closing the circle  there was no way out  there was no way to think other than with ones brain  no way to see oneself from the outside in order to check the correct functioning of ones internal processes    suddenly  a thought struck me  as simple as it was effective  i leapt to my feet and ran to the radio booth  the room was deserted  i glanced at the electric clock on the wall  it was almost four oclock  the fourth hour of the night agreed upon inside the station  outside the red sun was shining  i quickly switched on the long range transmitter and  as the lamps warmed up  i mentally reviewed the main steps of the experiment  i couldnt remember the call signal that the automatic satelloid station answered  i found it on a cardboard box hanging above the central control panel  i sent the call in morse code and the answer came eight seconds later  the satelloid  its electronic brain  announced itself with a cadenced signal  i commanded the satelloid to let me know which interstellar meridians of the galaxy it was crossing at twenty two second intervals as it orbited solaris  and i demanded fractions of five digits  then i sat down and waited for the answer  it came after ten minutes  i tore off the freshly printed strip of paper and hid it in a drawer  taking care not to look at it   from the bookcase i took out large sky maps  logarithm tables  a calendar defining the daily path of the satellite  and some auxiliary books  then i set out to find the answer to the question i had asked  for a good hour i lined up the equations  it had been a long time since i had studied  and i had not done such calculations  when was my last performance  the practical astronomy exam  no doubt  i did the calculations with the help of the stations huge calculator  my reasoning was as follows  by performing my calculations according to the sky charts  i would obtain

 an approximate cross check of the results provided by the satelloid  approximate  because the path of the satelloid is subject to very complicated variations  due to the action of the gravitational forces of solaris and its two suns  and also due to localised gravitational deviations caused by the ocean  when i have the two sets of figures  one provided by the satelloid and the other calculated theoretically from the sky chart  i will make rectifications to my operations  then the two groups will overlap up to the fourth decimal place  differences will only remain at the fifth  due to the unpredictable action of the ocean  if the numbers obtained from the satelloid are not a reality  but the product of my misguided mind  there will be no possible overlap with the second series  i thought  my brain may be sick  but there is no way it could compete with the great calculator of the station and secretly perform calculations that would have taken months of work  therefore  if the numbers match  the stations great computer really does exist  i have really used it  and i am not delusional  my hands were shaking as i took the telegraph tape out of the drawer and spread it out next to the wide strip of paper from the calculator  the two sets of numbers matched  as i had expected  to the fourth decimal place  the differences were only apparent to the fifth  i hid all the papers in the drawer  so the calculator existed independently of me  that meant that the station  with its inhabitants  really existed  i was about to close the drawer when i noticed that it was crammed with sheets of paper  covered with impatiently scribbled calculations  one look revealed that someone had already tried an experiment similar to mine and asked the satelloid not for information about the interstellar meridians  but for measurements of the albedo of solaris at forty second intervals  i was not crazy  the last ray of hope faded  i unplugged the transmitter  drank the broth that remained at the bottom of the thermo insulated bottle and went to bed
