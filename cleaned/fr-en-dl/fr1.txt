at nine oclock  ships time  i made my way to the launching pad  around the shaft  the men lined up to let me pass  i climbed down the ladder and entered the capsule  in the narrow cabin i could hardly spread my elbows  i attached the pump hose to the valve of my suit  which quickly inflated  i could no longer make the slightest movement  i was standing  or rather hanging  wrapped in my air suit and embedded in the metal shell  i looked up  above the transparent globe i saw a smooth wall and  at the very top  moddards head  bent over the opening of the well  moddard disappeared  it was suddenly night  the heavy protective cone had been put in place  i heard  eight times over  the hum of the electric motors turning the nuts  then the hiss of compressed air in the dampers  my eyes were getting used to the darkness  i could make out the phosphorescent frame of the single meter  a voice echoed through the headphones   ready     i replied   ready  moddard    dont worry about a thing   he said  the station will pick you up in flight  have a safe trip  there was a creak  the capsule wobbled  almost in spite of myself  i tensed my muscles  there was no other sound  no other movement    when will it leave   i asked  i heard a rustle outside   like a shower of fine sand 

   youre on your way     good luck   replied moddards voice  as close as before  a slit opened wide at my eye level and i saw the stars  the prometheus was sailing around the alpha of aquarius  but i tried in vain to orient myself  the porthole was filled with sparkling dust  i did not recognise any constellations  the sky in this part of the galaxy was alien to me  i waited for the moment when i would pass close to the first distinct star  i was unable to isolate any of them  their brightness diminished  they faded into a vague purple glow  i became aware of the distance i had travelled  my body stiffened  squeezed by my pneumatic envelope  and i split the space  with the impression of remaining immobile in the void and with the only diversion being the heat that was slowly  gradually rising  suddenly there was a crunch  a sour sound  like the rubbing of a steel blade on a wet glass plate  and then it was a fall  if the jumping numbers in the meter light hadnt warned me  i wouldnt have noticed the change in direction  the stars long gone  the gaze lost  again and again  in the pale red light of infinity  i could hear my heart beating heavily  on the back of my neck i could feel the cool breath of the air conditioner  but my face was on fire  i was sorry i had not seen the prometheus  it must have been out of sight when the automatic controls had pushed the window shutter aside  a jolt shook the capsule  another jolt followed  the vehicle began to vibrate  the vibration penetrated the layers of insulation  penetrated my pneumatic envelope and spread to my whole body  the phosphorescent frame of the counter spread in all directions  i ignored the fear  i had not undertaken this long journey to go astray  i called    solaris station  solaris station  solaris station  i think im going off course  pull me up  solaris station  this is the capsule from the prometheus  come in  solaris  go ahead 

 i had missed the precious moment of the planets appearance  it stretched out before my eyes  already immense and flat  yet  from the appearance of its surface  i judged that i was still far away  or  more exactly  that i was still very high  since i had passed the imperceptible boundary from which the distance separating us from a celestial body is measured in terms of altitude  i was falling  now  even when i closed my eyes  i could feel the fall  i hurriedly lifted my eyelids  for i didnt want to miss any more of what there was to see  i waited for a minute in silence  then i started calling again  there was no answer  in the headphones  crackling sounds came in bursts  against a background of low  deep rumour  which i imagined to be the very voice of the planet  a veil covered the orange sky and the window darkened  instinctively i crouched down  as much as my pneumatic suit would allow  almost immediately i realised that i was flying through clouds  as if sucked upwards  the cloud mass flew away  i hovered  sometimes in the light  sometimes in the shadow  the capsule turning on itself around a vertical axis  at last the gigantic solar ball appeared in front of the window  rising to the left and disappearing to the right  a distant voice reached me through the noise and crackling    attention  solaris station  this is solaris station  all is well  you are under the control of solaris station  the capsule will land at time zero  repeat  the capsule will land at time zero  stand by  stand by  im starting  two hundred and fifty  two hundred and forty nine  two hundred and forty eight    dry mewing interspersed with the words  an automatic device articulated the words of welcome  this was surprising  to say the least  usually all the men on a space station would hasten to greet the newcomer  especially when he came directly from earth  i did not have time to be surprised for long  for the orbit of the sun  which had hitherto surrounded me  unexpectedly shifted  and the glowing disc seemed to dance on the planets horizon  sometimes to the left  sometimes to the right of it  i was

 i swayed  like the weight of a giant pendulum  while the planet  a surface streaked with purplish and blackish furrows  rose before me like a wall  my head was beginning to spin when i saw a small chessboard of green and white dots   the stations orientation signal  with a clatter something snapped off the cone of the capsule  the long collar of the parachute furiously unfurled its rings  and the sound that came to me was irresistibly reminiscent of earth   for the first time  after so many months  the roar of the wind  then everything happened very quickly  until then i knew i was falling  now i realised it  the green and white chessboard was growing rapidly  i saw that it was painted on an elongated  whale shaped  silver sheen body with radar antennae bristling from its sides  i saw that this metallic colossus  pierced by several rows of dark openings  did not rest on the surface of the planet  but hung above it  casting an ellipsoidal shadow of deeper blackness on the inky background  i could see the slatey ripples of the ocean  with a faint movement  and suddenly the clouds rose high  surrounded by a blinding scarlet glow  beyond them the tawny sky became ashen  distant and flat  and all faded away  i was falling into a spin  a brief shock stabilised the capsule  through the window i saw the ocean waves again  like ridges of glittering mercury  the ropes suddenly snapped and the parachute rings  carried by the wind  flew tumultuously over the waves  oscillating at the very particular slow rhythm imparted by an artificial magnetic field  the capsule descended gently  i still had time to catch a glimpse of the grids of the launch pads and  atop their openwork towers  the mirrors of two radio telescopes  there was a clatter of steel bouncing off steel  the capsule came to a halt  a hatch opened and  with a long  hoarse sigh  the metal shell that imprisoned me ended its journey  i heard the lifeless voice of the control facility    solaris station  zero and zero  the capsule has landed  the end  with both hands  i felt a vague pressure on my chest and the viscera weighed me down unpleasantly  i grabbed the

 i grabbed the levers and cut the contacts  a green inscription lit up   arrival   the wall of the capsule opened  the airbed pushed me slightly backwards  so that i had to take a step forward to avoid falling  with a muffled  resigned hiss  the suit expelled air from its pads  i was free  i was under a silver funnel  as high as the nave of a cathedral  bundles of coloured pipes ran down the sloping walls and disappeared into rounded openings  i turned around  the ventilation shafts roared  sucking in the poisonous gases of the planetary atmosphere  which had seeped in as my vehicle landed inside the station  empty  like a shattered cocoon  the cigar shaped capsule stood  encased by a chalice mounted on a steel base  the outer skin  charred during the journey  had turned a dirty brown  i went down a small ramp  at the bottom  the metal floor had been covered with a rough plastic coating  in places  the wheels of the rocket carts had worn away this plastic mat and the steel was exposed  suddenly the fan bellows stopped working and there was absolute silence  i looked around  a little indecisive  waiting for someone to appear  but no one seemed to be approaching  only a neon arrow blazed  indicating a mechanical pavement that unrolled noiselessly  i let myself be carried forward  the ceiling of the room dropped in a beautiful parabolic line to the entrance of a gallery  in the recesses of the gallery were piled up heaps of compressed gas bottles  gauges  parachutes  crates  a quantity of objects thrown in disorder  the mechanical walkway deposited me at the end of the gallery  at the threshold of a rotunda  even more obvious disorder reigned here  a pool of oily liquid lay beneath a tumble of cans  a foul odour reeked in the air  footprints  slimy stains  wafted in different directions  a tangle of telegraph tapes  torn papers  all sorts of rubbish covered the cans 

 a green arrow lit up again  pointing to the central door  behind the door stretched a narrow corridor  where two men could hardly have walked abreast  glass paving stones  embedded in the ceiling  lit up this passageway  another door  painted in a green and white checkerboard pattern  was ajar and i entered  the cabin with its curved walls had a large panoramic window  which was filled with a fiery mist  under the window  the sooty crests of the waves passed silently by  against the walls were open cupboards filled with instruments  books  dirty glasses  and dusty insulated containers  five or six small rolling tables and shrivelled armchairs cluttered the stained floor  only one seat was inflated  with the back properly straightened backwards  in that chair was a small  skinny man with a sunburned face  the skin of his nose and cheekbones peeling off in large patches  i recognised him  it was    a cybernetics specialist   s deputy  in his day he had published some quite original articles in the solarist yearbook  i had never had the opportunity to meet him  he was wearing a net shirt  the mesh of which showed here and there the grey hairs of a scrawny chest  and a pair of canvas trousers with multiple pockets  a pair of fitters trousers  which had once been white and were now stained at the knees and punctured by reagents  he was holding one of those plastic drinking cups used in spacecraft without internal gravity  he stared at me  the pear slipped from his fingers and bounced a few times  spilling a little clear liquid  slowly the blood had drained from his face  i was too surprised to speak  and the silent scene lasted so long that   insensibly communicated his terror to me  i took a step forward  he curled up in his chair  he shuddered  as if i had struck him  he looked at me with indescribable horror and said in a hoarse voice   im sorry  im sorry 

   i dont know you    i dont know you    what do you want  the spilled liquid evaporated quickly  i breathed in a whiff of alcohol  was he drinking  was he drunk  but what was he so afraid of  i stood in the middle of the cabin  my legs were limp  my ears felt like they were stuffed with cotton  i felt as if the ground beneath my feet was not real  behind the curved glass of the window  the ocean was moving steadily   s bloodshot eyes never left me  the terror was receding from his face  the expression of invincible disgust remained  i asked softly   whats wrong with you  are you ill  he answered in a dull voice   youre worried    ah  so youre worried  why do you care about me  i dont know you  i asked   where is    his breath failed him  in the depths of his eyes  which had become glassy again  a gleam lit up and went out  he stammered   gi    giba    no  no  a stifled laugh  an idiots laugh  shook him to the core  then he calmed down    have you come for    for    what do you want to do with it  he looked at me as if i had just ceased to be a threat to him  in his words  or rather in his tone  there was hatred and provocation  i stammered out   what    where is he    dont you know  he was drunk  obviously  he had completely lost his mind  i was getting angry  i should have controlled myself and got out  but patience deserted me  i shouted    enough  how should i know where he is  since im coming now     whats going on 

 his jaw dropped  again his breath failed him and a different glow came to his eyes  with both hands he grasped the armrests of the chair  he stood up with difficulty  his knees were shaking    where did you come from   he said  almost sober  i replied angrily   from earth  perhaps you have heard of it  it doesnt look like it    from the    big sky    so you are         yes  what are you looking at me like that for  whats so strange about me  nothing   he said  wiping his forehead   nothing    im sorry     its nothing  i assure you  its just surprise    i didnt expect to see you    what do you mean you didnt expect to see me  you were notified several months ago  and moddard telegraphed today from the prometheus      yes  yes  of course  only  you see  these days were a bit    disorganised  i replied curtly   indeed    i can see that    circled around me  inspecting my suit  a very ordinary suit  with the usual harness of wires and cables across the chest  he coughed  felt his bony nose   perhaps you would like to take a bath  it would do you good    the blue door  on the other side    thank you  i know the layout of the station    maybe youre hungry    no  where is    without answering  he approached the window  with his back turned  he looked distinctly older  his hair was cut short and grey  and deep wrinkles crept into the sunburnt nape of his neck  behind the window the crests of the huge waves shimmered  creeping up and down in slow motion  watching

 the ocean  one had the impression   a mere illusion  certainly   that the station was moving imperceptibly  as if sliding off an invisible pedestal  then it seemed to regain its balance  before tilting to the other side in the same lazy movement  below  thick  blood coloured foam gathered in the hollow of the waves  for a fraction of a second my throat constricted and i missed the harsh discipline aboard the prometheus  a memory of a life that suddenly seemed happy and forever gone    turned round  rubbing his hands nervously   listen   he said suddenly   for the moment there is only me    today you will have to be content with my company  call me old rat  and dont make a fuss  since youve seen my photograph  youll just have to imagine that youve known me for a long time  everyone calls me old rat  i cant help it  besides  i suppose its a predestined name  my parents have always had cosmic aspirations    stubbornly  i repeated my question    where is    his eyelid fluttered again    i regret having welcomed you in this way  its    its not really my fault  id completely forgotten    a lot has happened here  you understand      its fine    so     hes not on the station  is he on an observation flight    looked at a pile of coiled cables    no  hes not out  no  hes not out  and he wont fly away  my ears were still plugged  my hearing was getting worse and i asked  what  where is he  his voice changed and he answered   you understand very well  he looked coldly into my eyes  i shivered  he was drunk  but he knew what he was talking about    yes    an accident 

 he nodded  nodding vigorously and watching for my reaction    when was it    this morning  at dawn  i felt an emotion without violence  this exchange of questions and answers had rather calmed me down by its conciseness  i began to explain  s strange behaviour to myself    what kind of accident    go to your cabin and take off that suit    come back here    in    in  say  an hour  i hesitated for a moment    well   i said at last  just as i was heading for the door  he called me back    wait  he had a strange look in his eyes and  if he wanted to say something  the words wouldnt pass his lips  after a while he said   there were three of us  and now  with you  there are three again  do you know      as i knew you in photography    hes in the laboratory up there  and i dont think hell come out before dark  but    youd know him anyway  if you saw someone else  you understand  someone who wasnt me or    you understand  then      so what  i was dreaming  it was all a dream  those black waves  with their bloody reflections  under the low sun  and that little man who had just sat back down in his chair  his head hanging again  and who was looking at a pile of cables    so dont do anything  i said   who can i see  a ghost    of course you think im crazy  no  no  im not crazy  i cant tell you anything else at the moment  besides  maybe    maybe nothing will happen  in any case  dont forget my warning    speak more clearly  what is it about 

   control yourself  prepare to face    anything  i know its impossible  try anyway  thats the only advice i can give you  i cant think of anything else  i shouted    but what could i face  seeing him sitting there  looking sideways  with his tired  sunburned head  i could hardly contain myself  i wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake him hard  i wanted to grab him by the shoulders and give him a good shake  he painfully let out his words one by one    i dont know  in a way  it depends on you    hallucinations    no  its    its real  dont attack  and remember what i told you  i didnt recognise my own voice    what are you talking about    we are not on earth  i shouted again    a polythereal form  they are not human at all  i was about to throw myself on him  to tear him away from the contemplation which apparently inspired him to make such foolish remarks  when he murmured   that is why they are formidable  remember what i told you  be on your guard    what happened to    he did not answer    what is   doing    come back in an hour  i turned away and went out  as i closed the door  i took one last look at him  he was small  huddled  with his head in his hands and his elbows resting on his stained trousers  only then did i notice the curdled blood on the back of both his hands
