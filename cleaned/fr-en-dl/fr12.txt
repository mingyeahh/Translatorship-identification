After six days  no reaction having occurred  we decided to repeat the experiment  Immobilized until then at the intersection of the forty third parallel and the one hundred and sixteenth meridian  the Station moved southward  hovering at a constant altitude of four hundred meters above the ocean  our radars  in fact  as well as the radiograms of the satelloid  signalled a renewal of plasma activity in the southern hemisphere  For forty eight hours an invisible beam of X rays modulated by my encephalogram struck the almost smooth surface of the ocean at regular intervals  At the end of these forty eight hours of travel  we had reached the edge of the polar region  The disc of the blue sun was descending on one side of the horizon  and already on the opposite side the puffy bulges of clouds announced the rising of the red sun  In the sky  blinding flames  sprays of green sparks fought with muted crimson gleams  the ocean itself took part in this combat of two stars  two balls of fire  blazing here with mercurial reflections and there with scarlet ones  the smallest cloud passing over the firmament enriched with iridescent shimmers the brilliance of the foam on the slope of the waves  The blue sun had just disappeared when  at the edge of the sky and the ocean  a gigantic glass flower  a symmetriad  appeared  barely distinguishable  drowned in the bloody mists  but immediately signalled by the detectors  The Station did not change its course  after a quarter of an hour  the colossal ruby pulsating with dying glow was again hidden behind the horizon  A few minutes later  a slender column  its base hidden from our view by the curvature of the planet  rose a few thousand metres into the atmosphere  This tree

 The swarming branches at the top of the column melted into a huge mushroom  simultaneously illuminated by the two suns  and blew away with the wind  the swollen lower part decayed into heavy clusters and slowly collapsed  The agony of the symmetriad lasted a whole hour  Forty eight more hours passed  Our rays had swept over a vast expanse of the ocean  one last time we repeated the experiment  From our vantage point we could see distinctly  three hundred kilometres to the south  a chain of Arrhenides  six rocky peaks  covered with a snow like material  in reality they were deposits of organic origin  proving that this mountainous formation had once been the bottom of the ocean  We then headed southwest  For a while we skirted the mountain range  crowned by the clouds that accumulated during the red day  then the clouds disappeared  Ten days had passed since the first experience  At the Station  apparently  nothing much was happening  Sartorius had set the programme for the experiment  which was repeated by an automatic system at certain intervals   I didnt even know if anyone was checking that the system was working properly  In fact  it was not as quiet as it seemed   but not because of human activity  I feared that Sartorius intended to finish building the annihilator  And how would Snaut react when he learned that I had deceived him to some extent  that I had exaggerated the dangers of attempting to annihilate neutrinic matter  Neither of them  however  spoke to me about the project any more  and I wondered why they were silent  I vaguely suspected them of cunning and concealment   perhaps they had been working in secret  Every day I went to look in the room where the annihilator was kept  a windowless room exactly under the main laboratory  I did not meet

 I never met anyone in this room  the layer of dust covering the frame and the cables of the device showed that it had not been touched for weeks  I couldnt meet anyone anywhere and I couldnt reach Snaut  when I tried to call the radio booth  no one answered the phone  Someone must have been directing the Stations movements  but who  I didnt know and  strange as it may seem  I didnt consider it my business  I was also indifferent to the lack of reaction from the ocean  so much so that after two or three days I had ceased to expect or apprehend it  I had completely forgotten about the experience and the possible reactions  I sat for days on end  either in the library or in my cabin  Harey  a discreet shadow  kept me company  I could feel that there was still an uneasiness between us and that my apathy  this state of suspended animation  could not be stretched to infinity  Obviously  it was up to me to take the initiative  it was up to me to change our relationship  But I rejected the very idea of any change  I was unable to make any decision  I felt that all things within the Station  and especially my relationship with Harey  had the fragility of an unstable scaffold   that the slightest change could upset this perilous balance and precipitate ruin  Where did I get this impression  I didnt know  The strange thing was that she too had a similar feeling in some way  When  today  I relive those moments  I am convinced that this impression of uncertainty  of reprieve  this presentiment of an imminent cataclysm was caused by an invisible presence  which had taken possession of the Station  A presence which I believe I can affirm that it also manifested itself in dreams  Having never had such visions before or since  I have decided to note them down  to transcribe them approximately  insofar as my vocabulary allows me to relate them  it being understood that these are only fragmentary glimpses  almost entirely stripped of an untransmissible horror 

 In an indistinct region  in the heart of immensity  far from heaven and earth  no ground under my feet  no vault above my head  no walls  nothing  I am a prisoner of a foreign matter  my body is coated with a dead  shapeless substance  or rather  I no longer have a body  I am this matter alien to myself  Nebulous spots of pale pink surround me  suspended in a medium more opaque than air  for objects do not become distinct until they are very close to me  but then  when the objects come nearer  they have an extraordinary sharpness  they impose themselves upon me with a supernatural precision  the reality of all that surrounds me now has an incomparable power of material evidence   When I wake up  I have the paradoxical impression that it is the waking state that I have just left  and everything I see after having opened my eyes again seems blurred and unreal   So the dream begins  Around me  something is waiting for my consent  my agreement  an inner acquiescence  and I know  or rather something in me knows  that I should not give in to an unknown temptation  because the more promising the silence seems  the more terrible the end will be  Or  more exactly  I dont know anything of the sort  because if I did  I would be afraid  and I have never felt any fear  I wait  From the pink mist that envelops me  an invisible object emerges and touches me  Inert  imprisoned in this foreign matter that surrounds me  I can neither move back nor turn around  and this invisible object continues to touch me  to examine my prison  and I feel this contact like that of a hand  and this hand recreates me  Until now I thought I could see  but I had no eyes  and now I have eyes  Under the fingers that caress me with a hesitant movement  my lips and cheeks emerge from nothingness  and as the caress spreads  I have a face  the breath swells my chest  I exist  And recreated  I create in turn  and before me appears a face I have never seen before  both unknown and known  I strive to meet the eyes in front of me  but this is impossible  for I cannot impose any direction on my gaze  and we discover each other  beyond all will  in a collected silence  I am

 I am alive again  I feel an unlimited strength and this creature   a woman    remains beside me  and we stand still  Our hearts beat together  and suddenly from the void that surrounds us  where nothing exists and cannot exist  an  influence  of indefinable  inconceivable cruelty creeps in  The caress that created us  that wrapped us in a golden cloak  becomes the tingling of an infinite number of fingers  Our bodies  white and naked  dissolve  turn into a swarm of black vermin  and I am   we are   a mass of slimy  intermingled worms  an endless  infinite mass  and in this infinity  no  I am the infinite  and I silently scream  I implore death  I implore an end  But at the same time I scatter in all directions  and the pain swells within me  a suffering more vivid than any pain experienced in the waking state  a suffering multiplied  a sword searching the black and red distance  a suffering hard as rock and growing  a mountain of pain visible in the bright light of another world  This is one of the simplest dreams  I cannot tell the others  for lack of words to express their horror  In these dreams I was unaware of Hareys existence  and I could find no trace of recent or ancient events  There were also dreams without images  In a still darkness  a  coagulated  shadow  I feel that I am being examined  slowly  thoroughly  but no instrument  no hand touches me  Yet I feel myself being penetrated from one side to the other  I am crumbling  I am disintegrating  there is nothing left but emptiness  and total annihilation is followed by a terror  the memory of which is enough today to make my heart beat faster  And the days followed one another  dull  always the same  I was indifferent to everything  I only dreaded the night and I did not know how to escape the dreams  Harey never slept  and I lay by her side and avoided sleep  I hugged her  kissed her  and cuddled her  and tenderness was only a pretext  a means of postponing the moment when I fell asleep    I had not told Harey of these horrible nightmares  but she must have guessed something  for her attitude was so different from that of my mother 


 I had not told Harey about these horrible nightmares  but she must have guessed something  for her attitude involuntarily betrayed a feeling of deep humiliation  As I said  I had not seen Snaut or Sartorius for a long time  Snaut  however  sometimes gave me a sign of life  he would leave a note at my door  or call me by telephone  He would ask me if I had noticed any new phenomena  any changes  anything that could be interpreted as a reaction to the experiment that had been repeated so many times  I answered in the negative and returned the question  in the background of the small screen  Snaut just shook his head  On the fifteenth day after the experiments had stopped  I woke up earlier than usual  the nightmare of the night had exhausted me and I felt a numbness in all my limbs  as if I had been under the effect of a powerful narcosis for many hours  The first rays of the red sun illuminated the window  a river of crimson flames flowed over the surface of the ocean  and I saw that this immense expanse  which had not been disturbed in the previous days  was beginning to stir  And suddenly a thin veil of mist covered the black ocean  but this pale mist seemed to have a very palpable consistency  Here and there a tremor agitated the mist  then gradually the vibration spread in all directions to the horizon  The black ocean then disappeared completely under thick  undulating membranes  with pinkish bulges and depressions of pearly shadow  These strange waves  suspended above the ocean  suddenly merged in a tumult  and there was nothing but a mass of glaucous foam with large bubbles  which a storm raised furiously to the height of the Station  and all around immense membranous wings  bearing no resemblance to clouds  soared into the red sky  Some of these foamy wings  which completely veiled the sun  appeared charcoal  others  exposed at an angle to the light  had cherry or amaranth tints  And the phenomenon continued  as if the ocean were moulting  shedding an old scaly skin  at times the black surface of the ocean glowed in an opening 

 immediately covered with foam  Wings of foam hovered close to me  a few metres from the window  one of them  a silky scarf  rubbed the glass  And as the ocean continued to spawn these strange birds  the first swarms dissipated high in the sky and decomposed into transparent filaments at the zenith  The Station remained stationary for the duration of the show  about three hours  i e  until nightfall  And even after the sun had disappeared  when the ocean was already in shadow  myriads of jagged wings could still be seen glowing as they sank into the sky  hovering in tight rows  climbing effortlessly  sucked towards the firmament  The phenomenon had appalled Harey  but it was no less disconcerting to me  nor should its novelty have troubled me  for solarists observed two or three times a year   and even more often  when luck favoured them   forms and creations which no directory had previously described  The following night  an hour before the blue sun rose  we witnessed another phenomenon  the ocean became phosphorescent  Patches of grey light were swaying to the rhythm of the invisible waves  These spots  isolated at first  spread out rapidly  joined together  and soon a carpet of spectral light spread out as far as the eye could see  The intensity of the light gradually increased for about fifteen minutes  then the phenomenon came to a surprising end  From the west came a blanket of shadow  advancing over a width of several hundred miles  when this moving shadow had passed the Station  the phosphorescent part of the ocean  retreating towards the east  seemed to flee from the gigantic extinguisher  it was like a routed aurora  pushed back to the horizon  which was encircled by a last halo  and the night triumphed  A little later  the sun rose over the deserted ocean  wrinkled with a few frozen waves  whose mercurial reflections came to strike my window  The phosphorescence of the ocean was a recorded phenomenon  which was sometimes observed before the eruption of an asymmetrical wave  and which in any case signified an amplification of the earthquake 

 of the plasma activity  However  for the next two weeks  nothing happened either outside or inside the Station  Once  however  in the middle of the night  I heard a loud scream  a superhuman  high pitched and prolonged scream  Awakened from a nightmare  I thought at first that another dream had followed the previous one  Before I fell asleep I had heard muffled noises coming from the laboratory  part of which was situated above my cabin  it had seemed to me that heavy objects  large apparatus  were being moved  And when I knew I was not dreaming  I judged that the scream was also coming from up there  but how could such a shrill scream have pierced a soundproof ceiling  The agonising scream lasted for almost half an hour  Dripping with sweat and nerves  I was about to decide to go upstairs  when the screaming stopped  and again I heard the muffled  distant sliding of heavy objects dragging on the floor  Two days later  while I was having dinner with Harey  Snaut came into the small kitchen  He had dressed  as one would dress on Earth after a days work  and this new costume changed him  He looked taller  and also older  Without looking at us  he approached the table  he did not sit down  but opened a tin of meat and began to eat  swallowing a mouthful of bread between two bites of cold meat  The sleeve of his jacket brushed the edge of the tin and was stained with grease  I said to him   Watch your sleeve  With his mouth full  he grunted    Huh  Then he continued to stuff the food as if he hadnt eaten anything for days  He filled a glass of wine  drained it in one gulp  sighed and rubbed his lips  With his bloodshot eyes he looked at me and muttered   You dont shave anymore  Ah  ah    Harey piled the dishes into the sink  Snaut rocked back and forth on his heels  grinning and sucking his teeth loudly  It seemed to me that he was exaggerating the noise to his hearts content  He glared at me 

   Have you decided not to shave anymore    I didnt answer    Believe me   he added   youre wrong  He had also started by not shaving      Go to bed    Go to bed    What  I want to have a little chat  Look  Kelvin  maybe he wants to do us good    Maybe he wants to please us  but he doesnt know exactly how to do it  Hes deciphering desires in our brains  and only two percent of the nervous processes are conscious  Therefore  it knows us better than we know ourselves  We have to get along with it  Are you listening to me  Dont you want to  Why   he was crying   why dont you shave    Shut up      youre drunk    Im drunk  So what  Because I drag my hump from one end of space to the other  and snoop around the cosmos  I dont have the right to get drunk  Why not  You believe in the mission of man  dont you  Kelvin  Gibarian told me about you before he grew a beard    He described you very well    Dont go into the laboratory  youll lose your faith  The laboratory is the domain of Sartorius  our Faust in reverse1     He is looking for a cure for immortality  He is the last knight of the Holy Contact  the man we need    His most recent find  too  was not bad   prolonged agony  Not bad  eh  Agonia perpetua    straw    straw hats    and you dont drink  Kelvin  He lifted his swollen eyelids and looked at Harey  she stood motionless against the wall  Snaut began to declaim   O white Aphrodite  born of the Ocean  your divine hand       He choked with laughter    A coughing fit prevented him from continuing  Calmly  with a cold rage  I squeaked    Shut up  Shut up and go away    Are you chasing me away  You too  You dont shave anymore and youre kicking me out  You dont want my warnings  you dont want my advice  Between interstellar companions  one must

 help each other  Listen  Kelvin  well go down  open the windows and call him  Maybe he will hear us  But what is his name  Weve given all the stars and planets a name  even though they may already have a name  Come on  lets go down  Well shout  well explain so well the trick he played on us that hell be moved    hell build us silver symmetries  hell raise his mathematical prayers to us  hell send us angels the colour of blood  He will share our sorrows and our terrors  and he will beg us to help him die  He already begs us  he implores us    with each of his manifestations  he begs us to help him die  Arent you smiling  You know Im joking  If the man had a better sense of humour  things might have turned out differently  Do you know what he wants to do  He wants to punish this ocean  he wants to make it howl with all its mountains at once    You think he wont have the courage to submit his plan to the approval of the sclerotic Areopagus that sent us here  as redeemers of faults that are foreign to us  You are right    He is afraid  But he is only afraid of the little hat  He wont show the little hat to anyone  he wont have the courage  our Faust    I was silent  Snaut swayed more and more violently  Tears streamed down his cheeks and fell on his clothes  He continued    Who is responsible  Who is responsible for this situation  Gibarian  Giese  Einstein  Plato  All criminals    Just think  in a rocket  man might burst like a bubble  or petrify  or fry  or sweat all his blood out at once  without having had time to scream  and there are only bones left spinning between the armoured walls  according to Newtons laws corrected by Einstein  those rattles of our progress  Contemplate our success  Kelvin  contemplate our cells  these unbreakable plates  these immortal sinks  this cohort of faithful cupboards  these devoted wardrobes  If I wasnt drunk  I wouldnt talk like that  but sooner or later someone had to talk  Did someone have to talk  You sit there like a child

 in the middle of the slaughterhouse  and you let your beard grow    Whose fault is that  Find the answer yourself  He turned slowly and went out  on the threshold he held on to the doorpost so as not to fall  And now his footsteps echoed in the hallway  I avoided looking at Harey  but suddenly I met his eyes in spite of myself  I wanted to stand up  to take her in my arms  to stroke her hair  I did not move
