The relentlessness  a kind of silent rage  had kept me upright in front of the calculator  Now  overwhelmed with fatigue  I could no longer tip a mechanical bed  forgetting to push back the spikes  I hung on to the handle and the bed frame collapsed with a single mass  I tore off my clothes and linen and threw them away  rolled them up in a ball  and then I dropped onto the pillow  I did not even bother to fluff it up properly  I fell asleep without turning off the lamps  I went to sleep without turning off the lights  and when I opened my eyes I felt as if I had been asleep for a few minutes  The room was bathed in a red gloom  I was less hot  I felt good  I was lying  blankets folded back  completely naked  The curtain covered only half of the window and there  opposite me  next to the glass lit by the red sun  sat someone  I recognised Harey  She was wearing a white beach dress  the material stretched to the tips of her breasts  her legs were crossed  her feet were bare  she was standing still  her arms spread out   her arms tanned to the elbow   and she was looking at me from under her black lashes  Harey  with her dark hair combed back  I gazed at her for a long time  peacefully  My first thought comforted me  I was dreaming and I was aware that I was dreaming  However  I would have preferred her to have disappeared  I closed my eyes and tried to chase the dream away  When I opened my eyes again  Harey was sitting opposite me  Her lips were turned up in her usual way  as if she were about to whistle  but her gaze remained serious  I remembered my speculations of the previous day about dreams  She had not changed since the day I last saw her  she was then a young woman of nineteen  Today she would be twenty nine  but of course the dead do not change  they remain eternally young 

 She looked at me with her always astonished gaze  I thought I was going to throw something at her head  but although it was a dream I could not bring myself to abuse a dead woman  even in a dream  I whispered   Poor thing  have you come to visit me  The sound of my voice frightened me  and the room  Harey  everything looked so real  A dream in relief  slightly coloured  and I could see a lot of things on the floor which I had not noticed when I went to bed  When I wake up   I said to myself   I shall see if these objects are really there  or if  like Harey  I have only seen them in a dream    I asked   Do you intend to stay long  I saw that I was speaking in the low voice of a man who fears to be heard beyond the door  Why worry about prying ears in a dream  The sun was rising above the horizon  A good sign  I had gone to bed on a red day  to be followed by a blue day  followed by another red day  I had not slept fifteen hours without interruption    it was a dream  Reassured  I looked carefully at Harey  The sun was shining on her against the light  the crimson rays gilded the velvety skin of her left cheek and the lashes cast a shadow across her face  She was really pretty  And I  even asleep  was terribly precise  I was watching the movements of the sun  waiting to see the dimple deepen in that unusual place  lower than the corner of the lips  However  I would have preferred to wake up  I had to get to work  I squeezed my eyelids shut  I heard a squeak  Immediately I opened my eyes again  Harey was sitting beside me on the bed  still looking at me gravely  I smiled at her  she smiled and leaned over  We kissed  a first shy kiss  a childs kiss  Then more kisses  I kissed her for a long time  Could I enjoy a dream like that  I asked myself  I was not betraying her memory  I was dreaming of her  of her alone 

 We did not speak  I lay on my back  when she lifted her face  I could see her diaphanous nostrils  whose quivering I had learned to interpret  With my fingertips I caressed the concha of her ear  where the blood had flowed under my kisses  Was it then that I began to worry  I kept telling myself it was a dream  but my heart was clenching  I bandaged my muscles to jump out of bed  I was almost certain to fail  for in dreams our numb bodies often shrink from obedience  I hoped  however  that this attempt would rouse me from sleep  I did not wake up  I sat up with my legs dangling  I had to endure this dream to the end    My good mood was gone  I was afraid  I asked    What   I cleared my throat   what do you want  My bare feet felt the ground  looking for a pair of mules  A sharp edge abruptly stopped my toe  I stifled a scream  With satisfaction I thought that this cry would wake me up  and I remembered that I had no mules  But it went on    Harey had stepped back  she was leaning against the bedpost  The throbbing heart was gently lifting the dress at the point of her left breast  Harey was watching me with quiet interest  Quick  a shower  Then I said to myself that a shower in a dream would not interrupt sleep      Where did you come from  She grabbed my hand  with a gesture I knew well  threw it in the air  caught it  fiddled with the fingers and answered    I dont know  Are you angry  It was her voice  her deep intonated voice  her slightly absent voice  She always spoke like that   as if she didnt care much about the words she was saying  as if she was already preoccupied with something else  People thought she was thoughtless  or insolent  for her eyes never wavered from an expression of vague astonishment 

   Did    who saw you    I dont know  I arrived without a fuss  Kris  does it matter  She continued to fiddle with my fingers  but her frown was no longer part of the game    Harey    What  darling    How did you know where I was  She thought  A smile   her lips were the colour of cherries   uncovered her teeth    No idea  Its funny  isnt it  When I came in  you were asleep  I didnt wake you up  I didnt wake you up  because you have a temper  You have a bad temper    She squeezed my hand tighter    Did you go downstairs    Yes  its all frozen  I ran away  She let go of my hand  She stretched out  her head back  all her hair thrown to one side  and she looked at me with that half smile which had irritated me before she seduced me  I stammered   But    Harey    but     I leaned over her and rolled up the short sleeve of her dress  There  above the flower shaped scar left by the smallpox vaccination  was a red dot  an injection mark  I was not surprised  instinctively  I was probing the implausible to gather the shreds of a coherent truth  and yet I felt dizzy  I touched that red spot with my finger  of which I still dreamed after so many years  of which I had so often dreamed  waking up at once with a groan and finding myself still in the same position  folded in half among the crumpled sheets  finding myself as I had found her  already almost cold  for in sleep I tried to relive what she had gone through  as if  beyond time  I had hoped to obtain her forgiveness or to keep her company during the last few minutes  when she was feeling the effects of the injection and terror invaded her  She  who dreaded a single scratch  who could not bear the pain  nor the sight of blood  had

 deliberately committed this horrible act  leaving only a few scribbled words for me  I had kept her note in my wallet  a faded note  with worn folds  which I never parted with  I didnt have the courage to get rid of it  So many times I had imagined her drawing those words  preparing to act    I convinced myself that she had put on an act  that she had only wanted to frighten me  and that the dose  due to a mistake  had proved too strong  Everyone suggested to me that it had happened that way  or that it had been a hasty decision  brought on by a breakdown  a sudden depression  People didnt know what I had said to her five days earlier  they didnt know that  in order to get to her more cruelly  I had packed my things  and that she  as I was packing my bags  had asked very quietly   Do you know what this means   And I had pretended not to understand  even though I understood perfectly  but I thought she was a coward  besides  I had told her so    And now she was lying across the bed and looking at me attentively  as if she didnt know that it was me who had killed her  She asked    Yes  so  Her eyes reflected the red sun  the whole room was red  Harey looked at her arm with interest  because I had watched her so long  and when I stepped back she laid a cool  smooth cheek in the palm of my hand  I stammered   Harey  this is impossible  I could see the movement of her eyes under the closed lids    Where are we  Harey    At home    Where is this  One eye opened and closed instantly  the long lashes had tickled my palm    Kris    What 
   Im fine  I looked up and saw part of the bed in the mirror above the sink  a tumble of soft hair  Hareys hair  and my bare knees  With the tip of my foot I drew one of the shapeless objects I had taken out of the box  I picked it up with my free hand  A rod had melted into a needle  I put the point against my skin and pushed it in  next to a small pink scar  Pain shot through my entire body  I looked at the blood dripping down my inner thigh and dripping soundlessly onto the floor  Terrifying thoughts assailed me  distinctly formulated thoughts  I had stopped thinking   This is a dream  I no longer believed in a dream  I said to myself   I must defend myself  I looked at her shoulders  the hip moulded in light coloured cloth  the bare feet hanging down    I bent down  took a gentle hold of one ankle  then ran my fingers under the sole of the foot  The skin was soft  the skin of a newborn  I knew  I had no doubt  that it was not Harey  and I was almost certain that she herself did not know  The bare foot stirred  a silent laugh swelled in Hareys lips   Stop   she whispered  I carefully released the hand that held her cheek and stood up  I dressed quickly  She had straightened up  she was looking at me  I asked her   Where are your things  And immediately I regretted my question    My things    What  you only have this dress  From then on  I continued the game lucidly  I tried to act carefree  indifferent  as if we had left each other yesterday   no  as if we had never left each other  She stood up  with a familiar  brisk and sure gesture  she pulled her skirt down to smooth it  My words had disturbed her  but she did not

 but she said nothing  For the first time she looked around the room with a curious  scrutinizing eye  then  perplexed  she answered    I dont know      She opened the wardrobe door   Maybe in there    No  there are only suits in there  I found an electric appliance next to the sink and began to shave  careful not to take my eyes off her  She came and went  snooping around  Finally  glancing out of the window  she approached me   Kris  I feel like something happened     She paused  I had disconnected the razor  I was waiting    I feel like Ive forgotten something   she continued   Ive forgotten a lot    I only remember you    I    I dont remember anything else  I listened to her  trying to keep a straight face    Was I    was I ill   she asked    Oh    yes  in a way  Yes  you have been a bit ill    Ah  well  that explains my memory lapses  She had calmed down  I could never describe what I was feeling  As I watched her come and go  smiling or serious  talking or silent  sitting down and standing up  my horror gave way to the conviction that I had Harey right in front of me  even as I corrected my judgment and she seemed stylized  reduced to a few expressions  a few gestures  a few characteristic movements  She pressed herself against me  both fists on my chest  at the base of my neck    Where are we now  the two of us  Are we doing well or are we doing badly    We couldnt be better  She smiles faintly    When you answer like that  it means that things are going badly  I said hurriedly    What an idea  Harey  my dear  I must go out now  wait for me    And I added  because I was getting terribly hungry   Would you like to eat    Eat    She shook her head  shaking the waving mass of her hair    No    we have to wait for you    for a long time 

   A little while    Ill come with you    You cant come with me  I have to work    Im coming with you  She had changed  it wasnt Harey at all  the other didnt impose her presence  no  she never imposed herself    She looked me up and down  and suddenly she took my hand  And my hand lingered  went up a warm  full arm  In spite of myself  I caressed her  My body recognized her body  my body desired her  my body drew me to her  beyond reason  beyond thought  beyond fear  Making sure I remained calm  I repeated    Harey  its impossible  you must stay here  One word rang out   No    Why    I dont know    She looked around  then looked up at me again    I cant   she said breathlessly    But why    I dont know  I just cant  She looked for the answer  and when she found it  it was a revelation to her    It seems to me that I must always see you  The decisive tone did not lend itself well to the admission of a feeling  it was something else entirely  This realisation abruptly  though not apparently  changed the nature of my embrace  I held her in my arms  I looked into her eyes  Insensibly  with an instinctive movement  I began to pull her hands back  and when they were together  my gaze searched the room  I needed a tie to bind her hands  His elbows collided  a powerful release followed  I hardly resisted for a second  Bent backwards and with his toes barely touching the floor  even an athlete could not have freed himself  but Harey straightened his waist and brought his hands to his feet 

 But Harey straightened her waist and pulled her arms to one side  her face  faintly lit with an uncertain smile  had not participated in the struggle  She watched me with a quiet interest  as she had at first  when I had woken up  As if she had not been moved by my desperate attempt  as if she had not noticed anything  as if she had ignored my panic attack  Standing before me  she waited   grave  passive  a little surprised  Leaving Harey in the middle of the room  I made my way to the shelf above the sink  I was trapped in a senseless trap and I wanted to get out of it  whatever the cost  If someone had asked me what exactly was going on inside me and what the events meant  I would not have been able to say three words  But I already knew that my situation was identical to that of the other inhabitants of the Station  that everything I had experienced  learned or glimpsed was part of a single  terrifying and incomprehensible whole  However  at this very moment  I was simply trying to find a trick  to work out a way of escape  Without turning away  I could feel Hareys gaze  Above the shelf  a small first aid kit was embedded in the wall  Hastily I examined the contents  Among the medicines was a bottle of sleeping tablets  I uncapped it and threw four tablets   the maximum dose   into a glass  I was acting openly  not trying too hard to hide my actions from Harey  Why did I do this  I didnt ask myself that question  I filled the glass with hot water  When the tablets were dissolved  I walked over to Harey  who had remained standing  She asked me in a low voice   Are you angry    No  Im not  Drink this  I had unconsciously anticipated that she would obey me  She silently accepted the glass and drank the hot liquid in one gulp  I put the empty glass on a stool and went to sit in the corner of the room  between the cupboard and the bookcase  Harey joined me  and she sat down on the floor in her usual way  with her legs bent  and with another movement

 her hair back with another familiar movement  I was no longer mistaken  it was not her  but I knew her by her slightest habits  Horror knotted my throat  And the most awful thing was that I had to trick her into thinking she was Harey  when she herself  in good faith  thought she was Harey   I was sure of it  if there was any certainty left  She leaned against my knee  her hair brushed against my still hand  and we sat there for a long time  From time to time I glanced at my watch  Half an hour passed and the sleeping pill should have started to take effect  Harey mumbled something    What are you saying  She was silent  I attributed her silence to the torpor of sleep  but in truth I secretly doubted the effectiveness of the tablets  Why  I didnt have an answer to that question either  Because my subterfuge probably seemed too easy  Slowly her head slid down my lap  dark hair covering her face completely  she was breathing at a steady pace  she was asleep  I bent down to carry her to the bed  Immediately she opened her eyes  grabbed the back of my neck and burst into a high pitched laugh  I was stunned  Harey was not happy  Her eyelids were pressed together and she was watching me  looking both naive and clever  I sat back down  stiff  bewildered  distraught  A final burst of laughter agitated her  then she snuggled up against my legs  In a toneless voice I asked   What are you laughing at  Her face again showed a worried astonishment  She obviously wanted to give me an honest explanation  She rubbed her little nose and sighed    I dont know   she finally said  genuinely surprised  Im acting like an idiot  arent I  But you look like a famous idiot too  as stuffy as    as Pelvis  It seemed to me that I had heard wrong 

   Like who    Like Pelvis  you know  the fat man    Harey couldnt possibly have known Pelvis  or heard me speak of him  for the simple reason that he had returned from the expedition three years after she had died  I had not known him before  and therefore did not know that he had an inveterate tendency  when presiding over the meetings of the Institute  to prolong the sessions indefinitely  His name was Pelle Villis  and until he returned I did not know that he had been nicknamed Pelvis by contraction  Harey leaned his elbows on my knees and looked me in the eye  I put my hands on his arms  moved up to his shoulders and to the base of his neck  the low cut dress bared the skin  which throbbed under my fingers  One could assume that I was caressing her  indeed  judging from her look  she did not interpret the touch of my hands in any other way  In fact  I could see once again that her body was warm to the touch  an ordinary human body  with muscles  bones and joints  Staring quietly into her eyes  I felt the awful desire to clench my fingers tightly  Suddenly I remembered Snauts bloody hands and let go  Harey said quietly   How you look at me     My heart was beating so fast that I could not speak  I closed my eyes  Immediately  from beginning to end and in detail  I conceived a plan of action  Without wasting a moment I rose to my feet   I must go out  Harey  I must go out  Harey  If you want to come with me  Ill take you    Ill take you  She jumped to her feet  Opening the wardrobe and choosing a suit for each of us from the coloured shirts  I asked   Why are you barefoot  She answered in a hesitant voice    I dont know    I must have thrown my shoes in a corner 

 I didnt insist    To put this on  youll have to take off your dress    A suit    why  She tried to take off her dress  but a strange fact was revealed  the impossibility of unzipping a dress without clasps  The red buttons on the bodice were just ornaments  There was a zip or other fastener missing  Harey smiled  embarrassed  As if this was the only way it had ever been done  I picked up a kind of scalpel from the floor and slit the fabric in the back  from the collar to the waist  Harey was able to remove her dress over her head  When she had put on her suit  which was a little too loose  and as we were leaving  she asked   Shall we fly away  You too  yes  I just nodded  I was dreading meeting Snaut  But the rotunda was deserted  the door leading to the radio booth was closed  A dead silence  always silence  hung over the space station  Harey was following my movements carefully  I opened a stall and examined the rocket  I checked successively the state of the microreactor  the functioning of the controls and the diffusers  Then  having cleared the empty capsule from the flared base  under the funnel shaped dome  I directed the electric carriage carrying the departing projectile towards the inclined runway  I had chosen a small vehicle used for the exchange of material between the Station and the satelloid  and only transporting men on exceptional occasions  because it did not open from the inside  I had chosen it very precisely according to my plan  Of course  I was not planning to launch the rocket  but I was simulating the preparations for a real departure  Harey  who had accompanied me so many times on my travels  knew a little about the preliminary manoeuvres  I checked the air conditioning and the oxygen supply in the cabin  connected the central circuit and the control lights came on  I came out and said to Harey  who was standing at the foot of the ladder 

   Come in    What about you    Ill go in after you  I have to close the trap door behind us  I didnt think she had any idea of the deception  When she had disappeared inside  I looked up into the opening and asked    Are you comfortable  I heard a muffled  yes   muffled by the smallness of the cabin  I bent down and with a single thrust I slammed the hatch shut  I pushed the two bolts open and with the key I had prepared  I began to turn the five safety nuts  The sharpened cigar stood upright  as if it would actually fly through space  There was no danger to the captive  the oxygen tanks were full and there was food in the cabin  and I did not intend to keep her prisoner indefinitely  I was desperate for two hours of freedom so that I could concentrate on making decisions and working out tactics with Snaut  As I turned the penultimate nut  I felt the three pronged fork that gripped the base of the rocket vibrate  I thought I had shaken the support with my impetuous spanner  However  when I took a few steps back  I saw a sight I would rather not have to see a second time  The whole rocket was shaking  shaken from the inside   and what shaking  A steel robot could not have given this convulsive tremor to a mass of eight tons  and yet in the cabin of the vehicle was enclosed only a graceful young woman  a young woman with dark hair  On the polished shell of the rocket  the reflections of the lamps quivered  I could not hear the shots  inside the projectile there was absolute silence  But the widely spread feet of the large base vibrated like strings  The rhythm of the shaking was such that I feared the whole scaffolding would collapse 

 I turned the last nut with an insecure hand  threw away the key and jumped down the ladder  Slowly backing up  I noticed that the shock absorbers  designed to withstand continuous pressure  were dancing furiously  It seemed to me that the shell of the rocket was wrinkling  Like a madman  I leapt to the remote control panel  with both hands I pulled up the starting lever of the engine  Then the loudspeaker inside the rocket let out a piercing sound   not a scream  a sound that did not resemble the human voice at all  and yet I could make out my name  repeated several times   Kris  Kris  Kris   I had rushed so violently at the controls  with such disordered movements  that the blood flowed from my flayed fingers  A blue glow  a pale dawn  illuminated the walls  Swirls of vaporous dust sprang up around the launch pad  the dust turned into a column of violent sparks  and the echoes of a mighty roar drowned out all other sounds  Three flames  at once merged into a single pillar of fire  lifted the rocket  which flew through the opening in the dome  a fiery furrow rippled as it collapsed  The shutters closed the shaft opening  the automatic fans began to suck in the choking smoke that bubbled into the room  My mind pieced it all together later  in reality  I dont know what I actually observed  Clinging to the control panel  my face baking hot  my hair twisted and toasted  I jerked in the acrid  ember scented air mixed with the ozonated effluvia of ionization  At the moment of the launch  I had instinctively closed my eyes  but the blaze had penetrated my eyelids  For a while I saw only black  red and gold spirals  which gradually spread out  The fans continued to whine  the smoke  mist and dust dissipated  I saw the greenish screen of the radar  Hastily manipulating the graduated knobs  I began to look for the rocket  When I located it  it was already flying above the atmosphere  I had never launched a projectile in such an aberrant manner  and I had never seen a rocket in such a short time 

 I had never launched a projectile in such an aberrant and indiscriminate manner  without bothering to regulate the speed and direction  I judged that the simplest thing to do was to place the rocket in a circular orbit around Solaris  at a distance of about a thousand kilometres  I could then cut off the thrusters  the range of which I did not know  and I feared a catastrophe with incalculable consequences  A thousand kilometre orbit was stationary   I made sure of that by consulting the chart  To tell the truth  this was no guarantee  but I could not see any other way out  I did not have the courage to switch on the loudspeaker  which was disconnected immediately after the launch  No  I didnt want to expose myself to hearing that horrible voice again  which had nothing human about it  I felt entitled to think that I had overcome the simulacra  beyond appearances  I was back to Harey  the real Harey  for her sake  the assumption of madness would have meant deliverance indeed  At one oclock I left the space station
