Hastily pocketing Gibarians notes  I approached the wardrobe  suits and other clothes had been pushed aside  squeezed to one side  as if a man had taken refuge in the back of the wardrobe  From the avalanche of papers on the floor emerged the corner of an envelope  I picked it up  It was addressed to me  With a dry throat I tore the envelope open  I had to make an effort to unfold the sheet of paper it contained  In his regular handwriting  perfectly legible  though very thin  Gibarian had drawn two lines  Supplement Ann  Solar  Vol 1   Vot  Separat  Messenger ds aff  F   Ravintzer  Petit Apocryphe  That was all  not a word more  Did these two lines contain any important information  When had he written them  I told myself that I had to consult the librarys files as soon as possible  I knew the supplement to the first volume of the Yearbook of Solarist Studies  that is to say  without having read it  I knew of its existence   did it not have the value of a purely historical document  As for Ravintzer and his Petit Apocryphe  I had never heard of it  What was to be done  I was already almost fifteen minutes late  Once again  with my back to the door  I searched the room with a careful eye  Only then did I notice the bed  standing upright against the wall and concealed by a large map of Solaris  Something hung behind the map   a pocket tape recorder  The reel had been recorded nine tenths of the way through  I removed the device from its case and hung it up 

 I took the device out of its case  hung it up in the same place I had found it  and slipped the tape recorder into my pocket  I walked back to the door  my eyes closed and I watched for any outside noise  Nothing  I opened the door to a black abyss and at last had the wit to remove my glasses  the filaments of light under the ceiling lit up the rotunda sparingly  Spread out between the four doors of the living quarters and the shaft leading to the radio booth  a multitude of corridors went off in a star shape in all directions  Suddenly  emerging from a recess that led to the communal shower room  a tall figure appeared  barely distinguishable  confused with the gloom  I froze  riveted to the floor  A giant  negroid woman waddled quietly forward  I caught a glimpse of the whites of her eyes and heard the soft click of her bare feet  She was dressed only in a yellow  woven straw skirt  her huge breasts swayed freely and her black arms were as big as thighs  She passed me   there was barely a metre between us   without giving me a glance  Her straw skirt swaying in rhythm  she went on her way  like those steatopygic statues of the Stone Age  which one can see in anthropology museums  She opened Gibarians door  Her figure stood out clearly on the threshold  surrounded by the brighter light that had come on inside the room  Then she closed the door  I was alone  With my right hand I took hold of my left hand and squeezed it with all my strength  until the joints cracked  I stared blankly at the large empty room  What had happened  What was it  Suddenly I faltered  I remembered Snauts warnings  What did it mean  Who was this monstrous Aphrodite  I took a step  a single step  in the direction of Gibarians cabin  I knew I wouldnt get in  With my nostrils wide open  I sucked in the air  Why  I had instinctively waited for the characteristic smell of his sweat  but I had not smelled anything  not even when we were only one step apart 


 I dont know how long I remained leaning against the cool metal wall  hearing nothing but the distant  monotonous sound of the air conditioners  I slapped both my cheeks lightly and made my way to the radio booth  As I pressed the handle  I heard a harsh voice    Whos there    Its me  Kelvin  Snaut was sitting at a table between a pile of aluminium boxes and the transmitter  eating meat concentrate straight from the can  Did he ever leave the radio booth  I looked at him and saw that he was playing with his jaws  and then I realised that I was starving myself  I walked over to the cupboards  chose the least dusty plate and sat down opposite Snaut  We ate in silence  Snaut stood up  uncorked a heatproof bottle and filled two cups with hot broth  Putting the bottle back on the floor   there was no room on the table   he asked me   Have you seen Sartorius    No    where is he    Upstairs  Upstairs was the laboratory  We continued to eat  without saying anything more  Snaut dutifully scraped the bottom of his box  Four globes  fixed to the ceiling  illuminated the room  a hermetic shutter closed the window outside  The reflections of the luminous globes vibrated on the plastic cover of the transmitter  Snaut was now wearing a flowing black jumper  which was fraying at the wrists  Red veins marred the taut skin of his cheekbones  He asked me   Whats the matter    Nothing    why    Youre all sweaty  I wiped my forehead  It was true  I was dripping  the reaction  surely  after an unexpected encounter  Snaut was looking at me

 Snaut looked at me with an inquisitive eye  Should I tell him  What incomprehensible game was being played here  and who was the opponent of whom    It is hot  I thought the air conditioning in your house worked better than this    The devices are automatically adjusted every hour    His gaze became insistent  Are you sure its just the heat  I didnt answer  Snaut threw the utensils and empty boxes into the sink  He returned to his chair and continued to question me   What are your intentions  I replied phlegmatically   That depends on you  I suppose you have a research plan  right  A new stimulus  probably X rays  or something like that    He frowned    X rays    who told you about that    I dont remember  Someone mentioned it to me  Maybe on the Prometheus  So  have you started    I dont know the details  It was Gibarians idea  He set it up with Sartorius  I wonder how you know  I shrugged   You dont know the details  I didnt finish my sentence  Snaut was silent  The yapping of the air conditioners had stopped  The temperature remained at a bearable level  A nasal sound lingered in the air  like the buzzing of a dying fly  Snaut got up from his chair and leaned over the control panel of the transmitter  he began to manipulate the levers  without order and without result  because he had left the ignition switch in the dead position  He amused himself for a moment  then he noticed    I could only see his back  and I said  Yes 

 He turned round and looked at me with an evil expression  I had not sought to enrage him  but  unaware of the game that was being played  I kept a guarded expectation  You went to Gibarians   he said suddenly   and that wasnt a question  I looked at him peacefully  You went to his house   he repeated  I nodded   If you insist     He asked   There was a man there  He asked   Was anyone there  So he had seen her   at least he knew she existed    No one    who could I find there    Then why didnt you let me in  I smiled    Because I was afraid  I remembered your warnings  When the handle moved  I held it mechanically  Why didnt you tell me it was you  I would have let you in  I thought it was Sartorius    And what did you think  To my question  he replied again with another question    What do you think    what happened there  I hesitated    You must know better than I do    where is he    In the cold room  We took it away this morning    Where did you find it    In the cupboard    In the cupboard  Was he already dead    The heart was still beating  but he wasnt breathing  It was the end 

   Did you try to revive him    No    Why  He stammered    I didnt have time  When I laid him down  he was dead    Was he standing in the wardrobe  In the middle of those suits    Yes  he was  Snaut took a sheet of paper from the corner desk and handed it to me  Ive drawn up a provisional report    After all  Im not unhappy that you saw the room  Cause of death  injection of pernostal  lethal dose  Its written there    I looked at the sheet of paper and muttered    Suicide    what reason    Nervous disorder  depression  call it what you will    you know better than me  I remained seated  Snaut stood before me  Intercepting his gaze  I replied    I only know what I have seen myself  He asked quietly   What do you mean    He stole the pernostal and hid in the cupboard  yes  In that case  its not a nervous disorder or an attack of depression  but a very serious condition  a paranoid psychosis      Speaking more and more slowly and not taking my eyes off him  I added  He certainly had the impression of seeing something  Snaut started to play with the transmitters controls again  After a moments silence I said   Here is your signature   and Sartorius    He is in the laboratory  Ive already told you  He doesnt show up  I suppose he      What    That hes locked himself in    Locked himself in  Ah  hes locked himself in    Maybe hes barricaded himself in    Its possible 

   Snaut    theres someone in the Station  someone else  He had let go of the controls and was looking at me  his torso tilted to one side    You saw    You warned me  Against whom  Against what  A hallucination    What did you see    A human being  He was silent  He had turned against the wall  as if to hide his face from me  His fingertips were tapping the metal plating  I examined his hands  There was no more blood in his knuckles  I had a brief glare  In a low voice  almost a whisper  as if I had confided a secret to him that no one should hear  I said   This is not a mirage  but a real being  who can be touched  who can be hurt  and whom you saw just today    How do you know that  Glued to the wall  he hadnt moved  my words were hitting him in the back    Before I arrived    very shortly before I arrived  wasnt it  He tensed  I saw the panic in his eyes    And you    He choked    And you  who are you  I thought he was going to rush at me  I had not expected such a reaction  The situation was becoming absurd  He didnt believe I was who I said I was  What did this mean  He looked at me with increasing terror  Was he delirious  Had the mephitic fumes of the outside atmosphere intoxicated him  Anything was possible  Yes  and I  I had seen her  that creature  so had I  I asked   Who is it  These words calmed him down  For a moment he looked at me with an investigative eye  as if he still doubted me 


 He sat down limply in his chair and took his head in his hands  even before he had opened his mouth  I knew that he was not resolved to answer me directly    The fever   he said softly  I asked again    Who is it  He growled    If you dont know      Then what    So what    Nothing    Snaut    We are isolated  far from everything  Lets put our cards on the table  Things are confusing enough    What do you want me to do    I want you to tell me who you saw    And you   he threw out his hand suspiciously    Well  Ill answer you and then you can answer me  Dont worry  I wont think youre mad      Mad  Mad    Good heavens    He tried to smile    But youve understood nothing  absolutely nothing    If for a moment he could have thought he was delirious  he wouldnt have done that  hed be alive    So your report  this story of nervous disorders  is a lie    Of course it is    Why not write the truth  He repeated   Why  A long silence followed  No  I really didnt understand anything  I thought I had convinced him of my sincerity  I had imagined that we would work together to solve the enigma  Why  why did he refuse to talk    Where are the robots    In the warehouses  We locked them all up  We left only the reception staff in place    Why  Again he refused to answer    Dont you want to talk    I cant talk 

 Constantly he seemed on the verge of giving in  then he shrank back  Maybe I should go up to Sartorius house  I remembered the letter  and in that moment I attributed great importance to it   Are you planning to continue the experiments  He shook his shoulders dismissively   Whats the use    Ah    then what are we going to do  He was silent  A faint sound of footsteps could be heard in the distance  bare feet hitting the ground  Amongst the nickel plated and plastic coated instruments  amongst the high coffers criss crossed with glass tubes and containing the complicated apparatus of the electronic installations  the muffled echo of this shuffling echoed in a grotesque and unreal way  Unable to control myself  I stood up  I listened to the approaching footsteps and watched Snaut  With his eyelids half lowered  he did not look frightened  So he was not afraid of her  I asked    Where did it come from    And when he was slow to answer   Wont you tell me    I dont know    I dont know  The sound of footsteps faded away and died    You dont believe me  I swear I dont know  Silently  I opened the wardrobe that held the suits and pushed aside the heavy tracksuits  At the back  as I had expected  hung the gas guns we used to move in the void  I picked up a gun  checked that it was loaded and slung the strap of the scabbard over my shoulder  It wasnt much of a weapon  but it was better than nothing  As I adjusted the length of the strap  Snaut smiled mockingly  showing his yellow teeth    Good hunting  I moved towards the door    Thank you  He tore himself away from his chair    Kelvin 

 I looked at him  He was no longer smiling  I had never seen such a weary face  I waited  he moved his lips  but made no sound  I turned around and walked out
