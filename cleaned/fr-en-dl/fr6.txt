my face and hands were burnt  i remembered that when i was looking for a sleeping pill for harey  i was in no mood to laugh at my own candor   i had noticed a jar of burn ointment  so i went home  i opened the door  the red twilight lit up the room  someone was sitting in the armchair  beside which harey had knelt  terror paralysed me  a panic terror that urged me to flee  it lasted only a fraction of a second  the seated form raised its head  it was snaut  cross legged  he was still wearing the same reagent stained canvas trousers   he was consulting papers  a whole sheaf of sheets lay beside him on a small table  he lowered the papers in his hand  pushed his glasses to the end of his nose and scowled at me  without a word  i walked over to the sink  took the jar of ointment from the medicine chest  and began to rub the fluid ointment on my forehead and cheeks  fortunately  i was not too swollen and the eyes  since i had had the reflex of squeezing my eyelids  did not seem inflamed  at the temple and cheekbones i pricked a few large blisters with a sterilised injection needle  the aseptic pad collected a serous fluid  then i applied two pieces of wet gauze to my face  snaut watched me the whole time  i ignored his gaze  when i had finally finished  and i was still suffering from the burns   i sat down in the second chair  before that i had to take off hareys dress  a very ordinary dress  but without the clasps  snaut  with his hands clasped around a pointed knee  continued to observe me critically    shall we have a little chat 

 i didnt answer  i was busy putting back a piece of gauze  which was sliding down my cheek    you had a visitor  didnt you  i answered curtly    yes  he had started the conversation in a tone that i didnt like    and you got rid of him  well  thats called being expeditious  he touched his forehead  whose skin was still peeling  revealing pink surfaces of new epidermis  i was amazed  why hadnt snauts and sartoriuss sunburns guided my thinking so far  sunburns    but no one was sunbathing here  without noticing the sudden glare in my eyes  he continued   i suppose you didnt do anything right away  what did you try  narcosis  poison  free fight    do you want to have a serious discussion about our business  or do you want to be a clown  if you want to fool around  you can leave me alone  he drew his eyelids together    often  one plays the clown in spite of oneself    didnt you try the rope or the hammer  and the inkwell  like luther  no   well   he grinned   hes a great guy  one  two  ill get you in the rocket  off you go  and thats it    he consulted his watch    so we have two or three hours    with an unpleasant smile he added  am i being obnoxious  i nodded vigorously   disgusting    and if i told you a little story  would you believe me  would you believe a single word of my story  i was silent  he continued  with his ugly smile 


   it happened first to gibarian  locked in his cabin  he only spoke to us through the door  and you wonder what we thought  i remained silent    of course  we thought he had gone mad  through the door he let out something   not everything  you may wonder why he didnt tell us that there was someone in his house  oh  suum cuique  but he was a real scholar  he begged us to give him a chance    what chance    he was probably trying to solve the problem  to get to the bottom of it  to classify it  he worked at night  do you know what he was doing  you must know    those calculations in the drawer of the radio booth    is that him    yes  how long did it last    the visit  a week or so    we thought he was hallucinating  having motor problems  i gave him scopolamine    what do you mean  to him    yes  he took it  but not for himself  he tried it on someone else  there you are    and what about you    what about us  on the third day  we decided to go in  to break down the door  if there was no other way  to upset his dignity and cure him    ah      yes    and then  in that cupboard      yes  my boy  yes  but in the meantime we had also had visitors  we couldnt take care of him anymore  we couldnt tell him what was going on  now its    its become a routine  he had spoken so low that i guessed the last words rather than hearing them  i cried out  i dont understand  if you were listening at his door  you must have heard two voices   

   no  we only heard his voice  there were strange noises    we thought it was him too    only his voice  how come you didnt hear    the other one    i dont know  i have a theory about it    ill let it rest  especially as theres no point in getting fixated on details  but you  did you see something yesterday  otherwise you would have thought we were crazy    i thought i was the one who had gone mad    oh  and you didnt see anyone    i saw someone    who did you see  i looked at him for a long time  his face was no longer smiling  and i said   that    that black woman    he was leaning forward  his body relaxed imperceptibly    you could have warned me      i warned you    i warned you  in what way    in the only way possible  i didnt know who you would see  no one could have known  no one ever knows      listen  snaut  id like to ask you    you    youve known the question for some time  is she    the person who came to visit me today      are you wondering if she will come back  i nodded  he answered    yes and no    what does that mean    she    this person will come back  unaware of everything  just as she was at the beginning of her first visit  more exactly  she will seem to be unaware of what you have done to get rid of her  if you respect the conditions  she wont be aggressive    what conditions    that depends on the circumstances    snaut    lets not waste time hiding    lets not waste time on secrets 

   stuff  kelvin  i dont think youve understood yet      his eye twinkled    well  can you tell me who came to your house  i swallowed my saliva  i lowered my head  i didnt want to look at him  i would have preferred to deal with someone else  not him  but i had no choice  a piece of gauze came off and fell on my hand and i shuddered    a woman who     i stopped    she killed herself  an injection      suicide    yes    is that all  he waited  as i was silent  he murmured   no  thats not all     i looked up quickly  he wasnt looking at me    how do you know    he said nothing    indeed  thats not all    i moistened my lips    we had an argument  or rather no  it was me  i got angry  you know the kind of thing you say at times like that  i grabbed my clothes and took off  she had hinted to me    she hadnt said it in so many words  when youve lived with someone for years its not necessary    i was sure she was talking off the cuff   that she wouldnt dare  that shed be afraid  and i told her that too  the next day i remembered that i had left those    those bulbs in the drawer  she knew about them   i had brought them from the laboratory  i needed them   i had explained to her that in high doses they were very strong    i was afraid  i wanted to go back and get the ampoules  but then i told myself that it would look like i was taking her words seriously  on the third day i made up my mind  i was worried  when i arrived  she was dead    ah  poor innocent  i was startled  but snaut was not laughing at me  it seemed to me that i was seeing him for the first time  his face was grey  the deep wrinkles in his cheeks expressed unspeakable exhaustion  he looked like a man who was seriously ill  strangely intimidated  i asked 

   why did you say that    because your story is tragic    seeing my agitation  he added hastily  no  no  you still dont understand  indeed  its a terrible burden to carry  and you probably consider yourself a murderer  but    there are worse things    ah  really    yes  really  and im even glad that you refuse to believe me  some of the things that have happened are horrible  but the most horrible thing is    what didnt happen  what never existed  i said  in a weak voice    what  he shook his head    a normal man     he said  what is a normal man  one who has never committed anything heinous  well  but has he ever had uncontrolled thoughts  something  a fantasy  arose somewhere inside him  ten or thirty years ago  something he fought against and forgot about  and which he did not fear  because he knew that he would never let it blossom and that it would never lead to any action  and now imagine that  suddenly  in broad daylight  he meets this    this thought  embodied  riveted to him  indestructible  he wonders where it is   do you know where it is    here   snaut whispered   in the solaris station  i hesitated    what is this about  he interrupted me impatiently   and you  kelvin  you are a psychologist  who hasnt had a certain daydream  a certain madness  think of a maniac who falls in love with a piece of dirty laundry  who  by dint of prayers and threats  and in defiance of danger  acquires that wretched rag  funny story  isnt it  a man who  at the same time  is ashamed of the object of his lust and cherishes it more than anything else  a man ready to sacrifice his life for this love 

 for he may have feelings as strong as those of romeo for juliet    such cases exist  dont they  you understand  therefore  that there must be things    situations which no one has dared to materialise and which thought has generated by accident  in a moment of madness  insanity  call it what you will  in the next stage  the idea becomes matter  thats it  stunned  my throat dry  i repeated    voila    my head was bursting    and the station  what does the station have to do with it    its as if youre pretending not to understand   he growled  looking at me with his eyes   i keep talking about solaris  only solaris and nothing else  if you are brutally disappointed by reality  its not my fault  besides  after what youve already been through  you can listen to me all the way  we fly off into the cosmos  prepared for everything  i e  loneliness  struggle  fatigue and death  modesty prevents us from proclaiming it  but at times we consider ourselves admirable  however  all things considered  our eagerness turns out to be a sham  we do not want to conquer the cosmos  we only want to extend the earth to the borders of the cosmos  one planet will be as arid as the sahara  another as icy as our polar regions  another as lush as the amazon  we are humanitarian and chivalrous  we do not want to enslave other races  we simply want to pass on our values and in exchange take over their heritage  we consider ourselves to be the knights of the holy contact  this is a second lie  we are only looking for man  we do not need other worlds  we need mirrors  we do not know what to do with other worlds  one world  our world  is enough for us  but we do not accept it as it is  we are looking for an ideal image of our own world  we are looking for a planet  a civilisation superior to our own  but developed on the basis of the prototype of our primitive past  on the other hand  there is something in us that we refuse  that we defend ourselves against  and yet that remains  because we do not leave the earth in the state of

 it is not just a statue of the hero man that flies away  we stand here as we really are  and when the page turns and reveals this reality   that part of our reality we prefer to keep silent   we are no longer in agreement  i had listened patiently    but what are you talking about    what we wanted  contact with another civilisation  contact has been made  and we can look at our monstrous ugliness  our madness  our shame under a microscope  his voice trembled with rage    so you think its the ocean  that the ocean is causing    this  but why  im not asking how yet  im asking why  do you seriously believe that it wants to play with us  or to punish us   primary demonomania  the planet dominated by a huge devil  who satisfies the demands of his satanic humour by sending succubi to the members of a scientific expedition    snaut  you dont believe such nonsense  he muttered through his teeth    the devil is not so stupid    i looked at him in bewilderment  perhaps the events   assuming that we had experienced them with a sane and lucid mind   had finally shaken his nerves  reaction psychosis  he laughed silently    are you making your diagnosis  dont be too hasty  youve only been through one ordeal  and in fairly benign conditions    ah  the devil had mercy on me  i was getting tired of the conversation    what exactly do you want  you want me to tell you what plans this mass of metamorphic plasma   x trillion tons of metamorphic plasma   has for us  no plans  perhaps    what do you mean  no plans  snaut smiled 

   you should know that science only deals with phenomena  not causes  the phenomena  they started to manifest themselves eight or nine days after this experiment with x rays  perhaps the ocean reacted to the irradiation with some other irradiation  perhaps it probed our brains and reached some psychic cysts  my interest was aroused    cysts    yes  psychic processes isolated from the rest  locked up  stifled  encysted   foci smouldering under the ash of memory  he deciphered them and used them  as one uses a recipe or a construction plan    you know how similar are the asymmetrical crystalline structures of the chromosome and the asymmetrical crystalline structures of the deoxy ribo nucleic acid molecule entering into the composition of the cerebrosides  which constitute the substratum of the processes of the memory    this genetic matter is a plasma  which remembers   so the ocean has read us  recorded the smallest details  and then    you know the rest  but for what reason  well  not to destroy us  it could have destroyed us much more easily  apparently   given his technological means   he could have done anything  put your look alike against me  put mine against you  for example  i shouted   oh  thats why you were afraid the first night i arrived    yes  i was  besides   he added   who says he didnt do it  how do you know im really the good old rat who came here two years ago    he started laughing silently again  enjoying my embarrassment  and then he growled    no  no  thats enough  we are both happy mortals    i could kill you  you could kill me      and the others  cant we kill them    i wouldnt advise you to try   horrible sight    nothing can kill them 

   i dont know  in any case  no poison  no knife  no injection      the radioactive gun    would you risk it    as long as we know theyre not human    in a way  subjectively  they are human  they have absolutely no idea where they come from  surely youve noticed that    yes  i have  so    how does it work    they    everything is regenerated with an inconceivable speed  at an impossible speed   at sight  and they start behaving like       how    how do you mean    as we remember them  as they are engraved in our memories  according to which    without worrying about the ointment that ran down my cheeks and dripped on my hands  i asked abruptly    did gibarian know    you mean    knew as much as we did    yes    very probably    did he tell you anything    no  he didnt  i found a book at his place    i jumped up    the little apocrypha    i jumped to my feet    he looked at me suspiciously and added  who could have told you about it  no  dont worry  you can see that my skin is burnt and that it is not regenerating  gibarian had left a letter for me in his cabin    a letter  what does it say    not much  a note rather than a letter  bibliographical references   allusions to the yearbook supplement and the apocrypha  what is this apocrypha    an antique  which seems to me to have something to do with our situation    here    he pulled a leather bound booklet from his pocket and handed it to me 

 i grabbed the little book with its worn corners    and sartorius    what about sartorius  everyone does what they can  sartorius  on the other hand  is trying to remain normal   that is to say  to preserve his respectability as an envoy on an official mission    youve got to be kidding    no  im not laughing  i was once with him  ill skip the details  but in short  there were eight of us and we only had five hundred kilos of oxygen left  one after the other  we abandoned our occupations  and finally we were a team of bearded men  he alone shaved  brushed his shoes  thats how he is  now  of course  he can only pretend  act  or commit a crime    a crime    youre right  the word doesnt quite fit   divorce by ejection   does that sound better    very funny    if you dont like it  suggest something else    ah  leave me alone    no  lets talk seriously  you know about as much as i do now  do you have a plan    no plan  i havent the slightest idea of what ill do when    when she comes back  if i understand correctly  shell come back    its to be expected    which way do they come in  the stations envelope is airtight  maybe the shielding    he shook his head    the shielding is in perfect condition  i dont know where theyre coming from  usually youre expected to wake up  and you have to sleep sometime    could we barricade ourselves solidly inside the cabins    barricades dont last long  theres only one way out   you can guess which  he stood up  i stood up too    come on  snaut     you suggest liquidating the station and you expect me to take the initiative on my own 

   its not that simple  of course  we can escape  even if only to the satelloid  and send an s o s  from there  theyll call us mad  of course  and keep us in a nursing home on earth until we politely retract our statement   distant planet  isolation  collective insanity  they wont think were unusual  after all  even in a nursing home we would be better off than here  a garden  peace and quiet  small white rooms  nurses  accompanied walks    hands in pockets  staring at a corner of the room  he spoke with the utmost seriousness  the red sun had disappeared over the horizon and the ocean was a dark desert  moire with dying lights  the last stray reflections among the long manes of the waves  the sky was blazing  clouds with purplish fringes crossed this red and black world  unspeakably gloomy    so  do you want to run away or not  not yet  he smiled    steadfast fighter    if you fully realised the question you were raising  you wouldnt insist so much  its not about what i want  its about whats possible    what is possible    thats just it  i dont know    so we stay here  you think well find a way    skinny  suffering  with his face peeled off and furrowed with wrinkles  he faced me    maybe its worth staying  he turned  picked up his papers and left  i opened my mouth to hold him back  but not a sound passed my lips  i had only to wait  i approached the window  and my eye wandered absent mindedly over the crimson shimmer of the dark ocean  i had the idea of locking myself in one of the rockets of the space station  a stupid idea which i did not pursue  sooner or later i would have to get out of the rocket 

 i sat down next to the window  i began to leaf through the book snaut had given me  the fires of twilight lit up the room and coloured the pages of the booklet  it was   compiled by a certain othon ravintzer  a graduate in philosophy   a collection of articles and works of a value that  in general  could not be mistaken  every science gives rise to some pseudo science  inspires a digressive approach in bizarre minds  astronomy finds its caricaturists in astrology  chemistry  in the past  found them in alchemy  it was therefore not surprising that solaristics  in its early days  provoked an explosion of marginal cogitations  ravintzers book gave asylum to precisely this kind of intellectual speculation  preceded   i must honestly add   by an introduction in which the author distanced himself from the texts reproduced  he considered  not without reason  that such a collection could offer a precious document of the period  both for the historian and for the psychologist of science  bertons report   divided into two parts and supplemented by a logbook statement   occupied an honourable place in the booklet  from two oclock to 4 40 p m   the local time agreed by the expedition  the logbook entries were terse and negative  altitude 1 000   or 1 200   or 800 metres   nothing in sight   deserted ocean  the same words were repeated several times  then  at 4 40 pm  a red fog rises  visibility 700 metres  deserted ocean  5 p m   fog thickens   silence   visibility 400 metres  with breaks  i descend to 200  17 20  i am in fog  altitude 200  visibility 20 40 metres  i climb back up to 400  5 45 p m   altitude 500  sea of fog up to the horizon  in the fog  funnel shaped openings through which i see the surface of the ocean  i try to enter one of these funnels  where something stirs 

 17 52  i see some kind of eddy   its spewing yellow foam  a wall of fog surrounds me  altitude 100  i descend to 20  this was the end of bertons logbook  this was followed by the story of his illness  or  more accurately  the deposition dictated by berton and interrupted by questions from the members of the commission   berton  when i descended to thirty metres  it became very difficult to keep the altitude  violent winds were blowing in that shaft  i had to hold on to the controls and for a while   ten or fifteen minutes   i did not look outside  i realised too late that a powerful vortex was blowing me into the fog  this was no ordinary fog  it was a thick  colloidal material that covered all my windows  i had a hard time cleaning them  this fog   this glue   was tenacious  in addition  because of the resistance of the fog to the propeller  the speed of rotation was reduced by about thirty per cent and i began to lose altitude  as i was very low down and was afraid of crashing into the waves  i let go of the throttle completely  the aircraft kept its altitude  but it didnt come back up  i still had four cartridges of rocket boosters left  i didnt use them  i told myself that the situation was not yet desperate  i thought that a layer of this glue had adhered to the propeller  but the surplus charge meter was still showing zero  i couldnt understand it  since i had entered the fog  i could not see the sun   only a red glow  i kept on moving  hoping that i would eventually come to one of these shafts  and after half an hour i did  i found myself in another crevasse  an almost perfect cylinder  a few hundred metres in diameter  the wall of the cylinder was a gigantic vortex of fog  spiralling upwards  i tried to stay in the middle of the  well   where the wind was less violent  then i noticed a change in the surface of the ocean  the waves had almost completely disappeared and the upper layer of the fluid was
 the waves had almost completely disappeared and the upper layer of the fluid   what makes up the ocean   was becoming transparent  with cloudy streaks here and there dissipating  and in a short time everything became clearer  i could see clearly to a depth of several metres  i could see a kind of mud  yellow silt  which projected vertical filaments  when these filaments emerged to the surface they had a glassy sheen  then they began to foam   they foamed   and then this foam congealed  it looked like a very thick burnt sugar syrup  these slimy filaments would tangle and knot  and swollen protuberances would grow over the ocean and gradually take on various shapes  suddenly  i noticed that my camera was offset towards the wall of fog  i had to manoeuvre against the wind and  when i could look down again  i saw something that looked like a garden  yes  a garden  trees  hedges  paths   but it wasnt a real garden  it was all made of the same stuff  which had now completely hardened and looked like yellow plaster  beneath the garden  the ocean shone  i went down  as low as i could  to observe this garden closely  question  did the trees and plants you saw have leaves  bertons answer  no  they were rough shapes   like a model garden  yes  a model  thats exactly what it was  a model  but life size  after a moment the model began to shatter  to break  to split into black cracks  from which a thick  mucusy liquid was escaping  flowing or pooling on the spot  the tremors increased  there was a prodigious boiling and everything was buried under the foam  at the same time  the fog walls were closing in  i increased the speed and went out to 300 metres  question  are you absolutely sure that you saw something that reminded you of a garden   a garden  without any other possible interpretation  answer  yes  i noticed several details  i remember  for example  that in one place there were boxes

 lined up  later i realised that it was probably an apiary  question  you understood later  but at the time  when you saw them  answer by berton  no  because everything was like plaster  but i saw something else  question  what  answer from berton  i saw some objects  which i cant give a precise name to  because i didnt have time to observe them properly  under some bushes  i thought i could see tools  elongated objects with teeth  they looked like plaster casts of our little garden tools  but i am not absolutely sure  but im sure   yes  im sure i recognised an apiary  question  you didnt think it was a hallucination  bertons answer  no  i thought it was a hallucination  i thought it was a mirage  i didnt think it was a hallucination  because i felt very well  and i had never seen anything like it before  when i went back up to 300 metres  and looked at the fog again  it had more holes in it  irregular holes   imagine  if you like  a slice of cheese  some of these holes were completely hollowed out and i could see the waves of the ocean  others were just large buckets  where something was bubbling up  i went down one of the shafts and   the altimeter read forty   i saw a wall lying below the surface of the ocean   but not very deep   the wall of a huge building  i could see it clearly through the waves  it had several rows of rectangular openings  windows  it even seemed to me that something was stirring behind some of the windows  but im not quite sure  the wall slowly rose and emerged from the ocean  a mucous liquid  veined with compact bulges  trickled profusely and flowed down the wall  suddenly the wall broke in two  sank into the depths of the ocean and disappeared 


 i climbed back up and continued to fly over the fog  almost skimming it with my camera  i discovered another well  much larger than the previous one  from a distance i had already noticed a clear  almost white  floating form  i had immediately thought that it was fechners suit  especially as i vaguely recognised a human form  and i had abruptly turned  for fear of losing my way and not finding the place again  this form  this body  was moving  sometimes it seemed to be swimming  sometimes it seemed to be standing  in the hollow of the wave  i was hurrying  i got so low that my camera bounced gently   it had probably hit the crest of the big wave i was overlooking  this body   yes  it was a human body  without a suit   this body was moving  question  did you see his face  answer by berton  yes  question  who was it  answer by berton  it was a child  question  what child  had you ever seen him before  answer from berton  no  ive never seen him before  in any case  i dont remember ever having seen him  besides  when i got closer   when i got within forty metres  or even before   i noticed that it was no ordinary child  question  what do you mean by that  bertons answer  ill explain  i didnt immediately understand what was troubling me  i only understood after a while  this child was extraordinarily tall  huge  to say the least  lying horizontally  his body rose  i believe  four metres above the ocean  i remember that when i hit the wave his face was a little higher than mine  and yet in my cabin i must have been at least three metres above the ocean  question  if he was so tall  why do you say he was a child  bertons answer  because he was a very small child  question  dont you realise  berton  that your answer lacks logic 


 answer by berton  no  absolutely not  i could see his face  he was a very young child  moreover  the proportions of the body corresponded exactly to the proportions of a childs body  it was a    an infant  no  im exaggerating  he was maybe two or three years old  he had black hair  and blue eyes  huge  he was naked  completely naked   like a newborn baby  he was wet  or rather glazed  his skin was glowing  i was terribly upset  i no longer believed in a mirage  i could see this child so clearly  he was rising and falling  following the movement of the wave  but apart from this general movement of the body  he was moving  it was horrible  question  why  what was he doing  bertons answer  it looked like a museum doll  but a living doll  he opened and closed his lips  he made different gestures  horrible gestures  yes  because they were not his own gestures  question  what do you mean by that  bertons answer  i was looking at him from twenty metres away   i suppose i didnt get any closer  but  as i told you  it was huge  i saw him very clearly  its eyes were shining  and you could really have thought it was a living child  if it hadnt been for those movements  those gestures that someone seemed to be trying to make    it looked as if someone else was practising those gestures    question  try to clarify your thinking  bertons answer  its difficult  im talking about an impression  an intuition  i wasnt thinking  but i knew that these gestures were not natural  question  do you mean  for example  that the hands did not move as human hands can move  because of the limited flexibility of the joints  answer by berton  no  absolutely not  but    these movements made no sense  each of our movements means something  serves a purpose   


 question  do you think so  the movements of an infant have little meaning  bertons answer  i know  but the movements of an infant are disordered  confused  muddled  the movements i observed    ah    yes  thats it   they were methodical movements  they were carried out successively  grouped in series  it was as if someone had wanted to study what the child was capable of doing with his hands  his chest  his mouth  the face was more terrible than the rest  because the face has an expression  and this face    i dont know how to say it  it was alive  yes  but not human  or rather  the features  as a whole  yes  the eyes  and the complexion  but the expression  the movements of the face  no  question  were they grimaces  do you know what happens to a mans face during an epileptic fit  bertons answer  yes  i have seen an epileptic fit  i understand that  no  it was something different  epilepsy causes spasms  convulsions  the movements im talking about were fluid  continuous  graceful   melodious  if you can say that about a movement  thats the most precise definition  but that face    a face cannot be divided into two   one half happy and the other sad  one half threatening and the other kind  one half afraid and the other half triumphant  with this child it was like that  moreover  all the movements and changes of expression followed one another with inconceivable rapidity  i was down there for a very short time  maybe ten seconds  maybe less than ten seconds  question  and you claim to have seen all this in such a short time  besides  how do you know how long you were there  did you check your stopwatch  bertons answer  no  i didnt check my stopwatch  but i have been flying for sixteen years  in my profession  we instinctively measure the duration of what we call a moment  to the nearest second  this is a skill that you acquire and that is indispensable for proper navigation  a pilot will never be worth much who does not know  regardless of the circumstances  whether a phenomenon lasts five or

 ten seconds  the same applies to observation  we learn  over the years  to see everything in the shortest time  question  is that all you have seen  bertons answer  no  but i dont remember the rest so exactly  i suppose i had already seen too much   my attention waned  the fog started to close in around me and i had to go back up  i went back up   for the first time in my life i almost flipped  my hands were shaking so badly  i could hardly hold the controls  i think i shouted something  called the base   i knew we werent connected by radio  question  did you then try to get back  bertons answer  no  finally  when i got to the top of the hill  i was able to get back to the base  finally  when i got to the top  i thought that maybe fechner was at the bottom of one of those holes  i know it sounds crazy  but thats what i thought  i thought that anything was possible  and that it would also be possible for me to find fechner  i decided to go down every hole i could find on my way  on my third attempt i gave up  when i came back up  i realised that it was useless to insist  after what i had just seen  this third time  i could not continue  i must add   the fact is already known   that i suffered from nausea and that i threw up in my cabin  i didnt understand anything  i had never felt sick before  remark  it was a symptom of intoxication  berton  bertons answer  maybe  i dont know  but what i saw that third time  i didnt imagine it  it wasnt the effect of intoxication  question  how do you know  answer by berton  it was not a hallucination  a hallucination is created by my own brain  right  remark  yes  bertons answer  well  my brain couldnt have created what i saw  i would never believe it  my brain would not have been able to do it  remark  tell us what it was all about 


 bertons answer  first i would like to know how the statements i have already made will be interpreted  question  what does it matter  answer by berton  for me it is of the utmost importance  i said that i saw things that i will never forget  if the commission recognises  even with reservations  that my testimony is plausible  and that the ocean should be studied   i mean  by directing the research according to my statements   then i will say everything  but if the commission considers it to be a delusion  i will say nothing more  question  why  bertons answer  because the content of my hallucinations belongs to me and i dont have to account for it  but i do have to account for what i have observed on solaris  question  does this mean that you refuse to answer any further questions until the competent office of the expedition has made its decision  do you understand that the commission is obviously not entitled to make an immediate decision  bertons answer   yes  this was the end of the first minutes  this was followed by a fragment of the second minutes  drawn up eleven days later   the chairman      after deliberation  the commission   composed of three doctors  three biologists  a physicist  a mechanical engineer and the deputy head of the expedition   has come to the conclusion that bertons report presents a hallucinatory syndrome of intoxication by the planets atmosphere  a characterized morbid syndrome  consecutive to an irritation of the associative zone of the cerebral crust  and that bertons account does not reflect any part  or at least no appreciable part  of the reality berton  excuse me  what does  no part  or at least no appreciable part  mean  how much of reality is appreciable or not  the chairman  i havent finished  in addition to these conclusions  the committee duly recorded a votum separatum from mr  archibald messenger  doctor of physics 

 who believes the phenomena described by berton to be objectively possible and is in favour of a scrupulous verification  that is all  berton  i repeat my question  the chairman  the answer is simple   no appreciable part  means that phenomena that were actually observed may have served as a support for your hallucinations  during a night walk  a perfectly sane man believes he recognises a living being in a bush shaken by the wind  all the more reason why the explorer  lost on an alien planet and exposed to a poisonous atmosphere  should not have such illusions  this judgment is not prejudicial to you  berton  would you be so kind as to inform us of your decision now  berton  i would first like to know the consequences of this votum separatum of dr  messenger  the chair  practically none  we shall continue the work along the lines originally established  berton  is our discussion recorded  the chairman  yes  berton  then i would like to say that the commission is not prejudicial to me  but to the very spirit of the expedition  therefore  as i have already stated  i will not answer any further questions  the chairman  is that all  berton  yes  but i would like to meet dr  messenger  is that possible  the chairman  of course  here ended the second minutes  at the bottom of the page there was a note in small print  the next day  dr  messenger had spoken for almost three hours with berton  following this conversation  messenger had again asked the expedition board to undertake research in order to verify the pilots statements  the pilot had revealed new  extremely convincing facts   which messenger could not disclose until the council had made a positive decision  the council   shannahan  timolis and trahier   denied the motion and the case was closed 

 the book still contained a photocopy of the last page of a letter   the draft of a letter   found by the executor of the estate after messengers death  ravintzer  despite his research  did not know if this letter had ever been sent       obtuse minds  pyramid of stupidity    so began the text     in order to preserve its authority  the council   specifically shannahan and timolis  trahiers voice does not count    rejected my recommendations  now i am addressing the institute directly  but  as you can imagine  my protests will not convince anyone  bound by oath  i cannot  unfortunately  tell you what berton told me  if the council has disregarded bertons testimony  it is mainly because berton has no scientific training   whereas any scientist could envy the presence of mind and the gift of observation of this pilot  please send me the following information by return mail  1  fechners biography  including details of his childhood  2  everything you know about his family  facts and dates   he probably lost his parents as a child  3  topography of the place where he was brought up  i would still like to tell you what i think about all this  as you know  some time after fechner and carucci left  a spot appeared at the centre of the red sun  this chromospheric eruption threw a shower of energetic particles mainly   according to the information provided by the satelloid   towards the southern hemisphere  where our base was located  and the radio link was broken  while the other teams explored the planets surface within a relatively small radius  fechner and carucci moved considerably away from the base  never since our arrival on the planet and until that fateful day had we observed such constant fog and silence 

 i suppose berton has seen some phases of operation man undertaken by this slimy monster  at the origin of all the forms berton saw was fechner   or rather his brain  subjected to an inconceivable psychic dissection  for a re creation  an experimental reconstruction  from imprints  among the most enduring  surely  etched in his memory  i know it sounds fantastic  i know i could be wrong  please help me  i am currently on alaric  where i will await your answer  your turn  4   it was dark and i struggled to make out the printed characters  which were fading at the top of the grey page   the last page concerning the adventure of the pilot berton  my own experience led me to regard berton as a reliable witness  i turned to the window  my gaze plunged into a purple abyss  a few clouds still glowed with a faint ember over the horizon  i could not see the ocean  covered in shadow  the ribbons of paper waved lazily under the grid of the fans  the warm air  still and silent  tasted slightly of ozone  there was nothing heroic about our decision to stay on the station  the time for heroes was over  the time for great interplanetary victories  the time for daring expeditions  the time for sacrifice   fechner  the first victim of the ocean  was a thing of the past  i almost didnt care anymore who was snauts or sartoriuss  visitor   soon  i thought  we will stop being ashamed  stop isolating ourselves  if we cannot get rid of our visitors  we will get used to their company  live with them  if their creator changes the rules of the game  we will adapt to the new rules  even if we start out resisting  rebelling   even if one of them is a  bad guy  

 even if one of us gives in to discouragement and kills himself  eventually  a certain balance will be restored  the night had come  like so many nights on earth  all i could see were the white outlines of the sink and the smooth surface of the mirror  i stood up  i groped around among the objects that cluttered the washbasin shelf  i found the box of cotton wool  i washed my face with a damp pad and went to lie down on the bed    a moth flapped its wings   no  it was the ribbon of the fan  the buzzing stopped  then started again  i could no longer see the window  everything blurred into darkness  a ray of light  falling from i dont know where  crossed the space and lingered in front of me   on the wall  or on the black sky  i remembered how frightened i had been the night before by the empty gaze of the night  i smiled at my fear  i was no longer afraid of that look  i was not afraid of anything  i lifted my wrist and consulted the crown of phosphorescent numbers  one more hour and it would be the dawn of the blue day  i breathed deeply  i savoured the darkness  i was empty  free of thought  as i moved  i felt the flat shape of the tape recorder against my hip  gibarian    his voice immortalized in reels of wire  i had forgotten to resurrect him  to listen to him   the only thing i could do for him now  i took the tape recorder out of my pocket and hid it under the bed  i heard a rustle and the door opened    kris    a worried voice whispered my name    kris  are you there  its so dark    i said    im here  dont be afraid  come on
