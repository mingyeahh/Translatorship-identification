sitting in front of the big window  i was looking at the ocean  i had nothing to do  the report  written in five days  was now a beam of waves running through the void  somewhere beyond the constellation of orion  when it reached the dark nebula  which absorbs all signals and light rays in a mass of eight trillion cubic miles  our report would be picked up by the first antenna of a relay chain  then  describing a gigantic arc  jumping from one radio buoy to another by leaps of billions of kilometres  the report would finally reach the last relay  a metallic block packed with precision instruments  and the elongated beak of the retransmission antenna would catch the beam of waves  concentrating it  to send it back into space  towards the earth  months would then pass  and a similar beam of energy from the earth would cut a disturbing furrow in the galaxys gravitational field  colliding head on with the cosmic cloud  it would continue on its way without loss of speed  amplified by the long chain of free buoys which would direct it towards the two suns of solaris  under the red sun  the ocean was blacker than ever  a russet mist veiled the horizon  the weather was unusually heavy and seemed to herald one of those terrible hurricanes that were unleashed two or three times a year on the surface of the planet  whose sole inhabitant   it may be assumed   controlled the climate and ordered the storms  for months to come  i would remain there  from my observatory  i would contemplate the birth of the days   a disc of white gold or faded purple  sometimes i would catch the rays of dawn playing among the fluid forms of some building rising from the ocean  i would see the sun reflected on the silver bubble of a symmetriad  i would follow with my eyes the oscillations
 of the graceful agilus bending in the wind and i would linger to examine the old powdery mimoids  and one day the screens of all the video phones would begin to flash  all the long dormant signalling devices would come to life  revived by an impulse emitted hundreds of billions of kilometres away and announcing the arrival of a metallic colossus  which would descend towards us with the deafening noise of its gravitators  it would be the ulysses  or the prometheus  or some other cosmic cruiser  through the hatch i would emerge onto the flat roof of the station  i would then see battalions of massive  white shelled automatons  creatures alien to original sin  who in their innocence go to the end of their task  not hesitating to destroy themselves or the unforeseen obstacle  strictly obeying the orders recorded by the crystals of their memory  then  faster than sound  the ship would rise noiselessly  leaving a salvo of detonations far back over the ocean  and the faces of all the passengers would light up at the idea of going home  home    but what did that mean to me  earth  i thought of those great  crowded  noisy cities  where i would get lost  where i would get lost   i thought of those cities  as i had thought of the ocean  the second or third night  when i had wanted to rush into the black waves  i will drown among men  i will be taciturn and attentive   a valued companion  i will have many relations  friends  and women   and perhaps even a wife  for a while i will have to make an effort to smile  to bow  to straighten up  to perform the thousand little gestures of which life on earth is composed  until all these gestures become reflexes again  i will find new interests  new occupations  to which i will not give my all  no  i will never again give myself entirely to anything or anyone  and perhaps  at night  i will look in the direction of the dark nebula  the black curtain that veils the brightness of the two suns  and i will remember everything  even what i am thinking right now  with a condescending smile  mixed with a little regret  i will remember my

 my follies and my hopes  and this kelvin of the future will be no less than the kelvin of the past  who was ready to do anything in the name of an ambitious project called contact  and no one will have the right to judge me  snaut entered the cabin  he glanced round  then stopped to look at me  i stood up and walked over to the table    do you need me    dont you have something to do  i could give you some work  some calculations  oh  not very urgent work    i smiled    thank you  theres no need  he looked out of the window    are you sure    yes    i was thinking about different things  and      id prefer you to think a little less    but you dont know what i was thinking  tell me    do you believe in god  he gave me a worried look    what     who still believes today    i took a casual tone    its not that simple  its not the traditional god of the earths religions  i am not a specialist in the history of religions and i may not have invented anything  do you know  by any chance  if there has ever been a faith in an imperfect god  he frowned    imperfect  what do you mean  in a sense  the gods of all religions were imperfect  loaded only with amplified human attributes  the god of the old testament  for example  demanded humble submission and sacrifice  he was jealous of the other gods    the greek gods  with their quarrelsome temper  their family quarrels  were as imperfect as men  i interrupted him   no  i am not thinking of a god whose imperfection is the result of the candour of his human creators  but whose imperfection is the fundamental  immanent characteristic  a god limited in his omniscience and in his

 a god limited in his omniscience and omnipotence  fallible  unable to foresee the consequences of his acts  creating phenomena that engender horror  he is a crippled god  whose ambitions exceed his strength  and who does not immediately realise this  a di eu who created clocks  but not the time they measure  he created systems  or mechanisms  that served definite ends  but which exceeded those ends and betrayed them  and he created eternity  which was to measure his power  and which measures his infinite defeat  snaut hesitated  but there was no longer the suspicious reserve in his attitude that he had shown me recently    manichaeism  in the past    i interrupted him immediately    nothing in common with the principle of good and evil  this god does not exist outside of matter  he would like to free himself from matter  but he cannot    snaut thought for a moment    i do not know of any religion of this kind  i dont know of any religion of that kind  this kind of religion has never been    necessary  if i understand you  and im afraid i do  you envisage an evolutionary god  who develops over time  grows  and keeps increasing his power by becoming aware of his powerlessness  for your god  the divine condition is a hopeless situation   and  having understood his situation  he despairs  yes  but is not the desperate god man  my dear kelvin  this is man you are talking about  and it is not only a damn philosophy  it is a damn mysticism  i persisted   no  its not about man  it is possible that in some respects man fits this provisional definition  but that is because it has many gaps  man  despite appearances  does not create goals for himself  time   the age   imposes them on him  man can serve his time or rebel  but the object to which he devotes his care  or against which he rebels  is given to him from without  if there were only one man  he could apparently attempt the experiment of creating goals for himself in complete freedom   apparently  because the man who has not been brought up among others

 cannot become a man  and the one    the one im thinking of    he cannot exist in the plural  you understand  snaut pointed to the window    ah  he said  then    no  not him either  in the course of his development  he probably came close to the divine state  but he shut himself off too soon  he is more of an anchorite  a hermit of the cosmos  not a god    he repeats himself  snaut  and the one i am thinking of would never repeat himself  he may already have been born somewhere  in a corner of the galaxy  and soon  seized by a youthful intoxication  he will begin to extinguish stars  to light up others    we will notice him after a while    weve already noticed it   said snaut  in a sour tone  the novae and supernovae    according to you  they are the candles of his altar    and solaris may be the cradle of your divine infant  added snaut  with a smile that widened and multiplied the wrinkles around his eyes  solaris may be a first state of the desperate god    his intelligence may be developing immensely    all the contents of our libraries of solaristics may be only the enormous repertoire of his infantile wailings    i continued    and for some time we will have been the rattles of this baby  its possible  and do you know what you have just done  youve created an entirely new hypothesis on the theme of solaris   my compliments  immediately  everything is explained  the impossibility of establishing contact  the lack of answers  certain    lets say certain extravagances in her behaviour towards us  everything is explained by the psychology of a small child    standing in front of the window  snaut growled    i renounce the paternity of the hypothesis    for a long time  we contemplated the black waves  a pale  elongated spot could be seen in the east  in the mist which veiled the horizon 

 without taking his eyes off the shimmering desert  snaut asked suddenly   where did you get this idea of an imperfect god    i dont know  i find it very  very plausible  it is the only god i would be inclined to believe in  a god whose passion is not redemption  a god who saves nothing  serves nothing   a god who simply is    a mimic   snaut gasped    what are you saying  ah  yes  i noticed that  a very old mimoid  both of us looked towards the misty horizon  suddenly i said    im going out  ive never left the station before  this is a good opportunity  ill be back in half an hour    snauts eyes widened    what     youre going out    where are you going  i showed him the flesh coloured patch that the mist was blurring    over there  anything to prevent that  ill take a small helicopter  i wouldnt want to have to confess  when i get back to earth  that im a solarist who has never set foot on solaris  i opened the cupboard and began to rummage through the suits  snaut watched me in silence  finally he said   i dont like it  i had chosen a suit and turned round    what    i hadnt felt such excitement for a long time    what are you worried about  put down your cards  youre afraid ill    what an idea  i swear i have no intention    i havent even thought about it  no  i really havent    ill go with you    thank you  but i prefer to go out alone    i was putting on the suit    snaut grumbled something  but i didnt understand what he was saying  i hurriedly completed my equipment 

 he accompanied me to the space station  helped me to release the aircraft from its stall and place it on the launch disk  just as i was about to adjust the suit  he asked abruptly    can i trust your word    good god  snaut    again  yes  you can trust the word i gave you    where are the oxygen tanks  he said no more  when i had closed the transparent dome  i waved to him  he started the lift  and i emerged on the roof of the station  the engine awoke  hummed  the three bladed propeller spun  the craft rose  strangely light  and the station moved quickly away  alone over the ocean  i saw it with new eyes  i was flying low   between forty and sixty metres  for the first time i felt an impression  often described by explorers  which i had never experienced when looking down from the station  the alternating motion of the shining waves was not the undulation of the sea or the rush of clouds  but an animal crawl   the slow  incessant contractions of muscular flesh secreting crimson foam  as i turned to head for the drifting mimoid  the sun hit me in the eyes  and bloody flashes of lightning flashed on the curved windows  the black ocean  bristling with dark flames  turned blue  the plane curved too far and i was thrown far downwind of the mimoid  a long irregular silhouette towering over the ocean  i lost sight of the mimoid for a moment and saw the station  which seemed to be sitting on the ocean level and whose shape reminded me of an ancient zeppelin  i rectified the direction  the steep mass of the mimoid  a baroque sculpture  grew in the line of sight  i was afraid of hitting the bulbous protuberances and i straightened the helicopter so abruptly that it lost speed and began to pitch  my precaution had been useless  for the rounded tops of these fantastic towers were lowering  i adjusted my flight

 i adjusted my flight to the drift of the island  and slowly  metre by metre  i descended until i skimmed the eroded peaks  the mimoid was not large  from one end to the other it was three quarters of a mile long and a few hundred metres wide  in some places there were narrowings that indicated a forthcoming break  this mimoid was obviously a fragment of an incomparably larger formation  on a solar scale  it was only a tiny sliver  a piece of debris  who knows how many weeks or months old  amongst the veiny rocks that overhung the ocean  i discovered a sort of beach  a sloping and relatively flat surface   a few dozen square metres   towards which i directed the aircraft  i landed  not without difficulty   the propeller had almost hit a cliff that had suddenly risen in front of me  i stopped the engine and lifted the dome  i stood on the helicopters aileron and checked that it was not in danger of slipping into the ocean  fifteen paces away  the waves were lapping the jagged shoreline  but the helicopter rested firmly on its circumflex legs  i jumped    to  land   the cliff i had almost snagged was a huge bony membrane with holes in it  standing upright and with gnarled bulges in it  a breach  a few metres wide  split this wall at an angle and allowed me to examine the interior of the island  already glimpsed through the openings in the cliff  i carefully pulled myself up onto the nearest ledge   my soles did not slip  the suit did not hinder my movements  continuing to climb  i found myself four stories above the ocean and could see a wide expanse of the petrified landscape that was lost in the depths of the mimoid  i thought i saw the ruins of an archaic city  a centuries old moroccan city  shattered by an earthquake or some other cataclysm  i could make out a tangled network of winding alleys  clogged with rubbish  alleys that sloped steeply down to the shore  bathed in creamy foam  further on were intact battlements  bastions with peeling buttresses  in the

 in the swollen  sagging walls were black holes  the remains of windows or loopholes  the whole floating city  tilted sharply to one side  like a ship about to capsize  glided along at random  turning over very slowly  as the movement of the sun in the firmament testified  the shadows crawled lazily among the alleys of this ruined city  and from time to time a polished surface reflected a ray of light towards me  i risked climbing higher  and then stopped  threads of fine sand began to drip from the rocks above my head  and  falling into the ravines and alleys  the cascades of sand bounced in swirls of dust  the mimoid  of course  is not made of stone  and all resemblance to limestone is lost by lifting a rocky chip  the material that makes up the mimoid  lighter than pumice  is made of small cells and extremely porous  i was high enough to feel the movement of the mimoid  not only was the mimoid moving forward  driven by the black muscles of the ocean towards an unknown destination  but its inclination varied  sometimes it tilted to one side  sometimes to the other  and this languid swaying was accompanied by the light rustle of the yellow and grey foam that trickled along the emerged shore  this swinging motion had been imprinted on the mimoid long before  probably at its birth  and the floating island  as it grew and fragmented  had retained the original movement  having examined from my aerial observatory all that presented itself to me  i descended cautiously  and only then  strangely enough  did i realise that i was not interested in the mimoid at all  that i had flown here not to get acquainted with the mimoid  but to get acquainted with the ocean  with the helicopter a few steps behind me  i sat down on the rough  cracked beach  a heavy black wave washed over the lower shore and spread out  not black  but dirty green  as it receded  the wave left viscous rivulets  which flowed shakily into the ocean  i moved closer to the shore and  when the next wave came  i stretched out my arm  then a phenomenon that had already occurred was faithfully reproduced 

 the wave hesitated  receded  and then enveloped my hand  without touching it  so that a thin layer of  air  separated my glove from this cavity  fluid a moment before and now really fleshy  slowly i lifted my hand  and the wave  or rather this outgrowth of the wave  rose simultaneously  still enveloping my hand in a translucent cyst with greenish tints  i drew myself up  so as to be able to raise my hand again  the gelatinous substance  following the movement of my hand  tightened like a rope  but did not break  the very mass of the wave  completely flat  adhered to the shore and surrounded my feet  without touching them   like some strange beast patiently waiting for the end of the experiment  from the ocean a flower had sprung up  its calyx moulding my fingers  i stepped back  the stem vibrated  wavered  irresolute  and fell back  the wave picked it up and withdrew  i repeated the game several times  and then   as the first experimenter had noted a hundred years earlier   a wave arrived  which avoided me  indifferent  as if satiated with an impression that was too well known  i knew that to revive the oceans  curiosity  i would have to wait a few hours  i sat down again  i was no longer quite the same  troubled by this phenomenon i had provoked  and yet of which i had read many descriptions  but no description could translate the experience as i had lived it  in all its movements  considered together or in isolation  each of these branches growing out of the ocean seemed to reveal a kind of cautious  but not fierce  candour  an avid curiosity to know quickly  to understand a new  unexpected form  and a regret at having to withdraw  at not being able to cross the limits imposed by a mysterious law  what an inexpressible contrast between this alert curiosity and the shimmering immensity of the ocean that stretched as far as the eye could see    never before had i felt its gigantic presence  its powerful and uncompromising silence  this secret force that regularly animated the waves  motionless  staring  i sank into a universe of inertia hitherto unknown  i slid down a slope

 i identified myself with this fluid and mute colossus   as if i had forgiven him everything  without the slightest effort  without a word  without a thought  during that last week i had behaved so well that snaut had stopped pursuing me with his wary gaze  on the surface i was calm  secretly  and without admitting it clearly  i was waiting for something  for what  his return  how could i have expected him to return  we all know that we are material beings  subject to the laws of physiology and physics  and the very strength of all our feelings combined cannot fight against these laws  we can only hate them  the immemorial faith of lovers and poets in the power of love  stronger than death  the age old finis vitae sed non amoris  is a lie  a useless lie  and not even funny  so can we accept the idea of being a clock measuring the passage of time  sometimes out of order  sometimes repaired  and whose mechanism  as soon as the builder sets it in motion  generates despair and love  can we come to terms with the idea that every man relives old torments  all the more profound because they become more comical by repeating themselves  that human existence repeats itself  fine  but that it repeats itself like a worn out song  like the record that a drunkard spins over and over again by throwing a coin into the slot machine  i did not believe that this fluid colossus  which had caused the death of hundreds of men  with which the whole human race had been trying in vain for so many years to establish even the most tenuous relations  this ocean which carried me without caring more about me than a speck of dust  no  i did not believe that it could be moved by the tragedy of two human beings  but his activities had a purpose    to tell the truth  i wasnt absolutely sure  but to leave was to give up a chance  perhaps a tiny one  perhaps only an imaginary one    was it necessary to continue to live here  among the furniture  the objects that we had both touched  in the air that she had breathed  in the name of what  in the hope of her return  i hoped for nothing  and yet i lived in expectation   since she had disappeared  i had nothing left 

 only the waiting  what achievements  what mockery  what torture did i still expect  i didnt know  i didnt know everything  and i persisted in believing that the time of cruel miracles was not over
