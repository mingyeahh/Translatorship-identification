three weeks passed  the window shutters were lowered and raised at fixed times  at night i was a prisoner of my nightmares  and every morning the comedy began again  but was it a comedy  i was making up a peaceful appearance  and harey was playing the same game  we were deceiving each other  knowingly  and this agreement served our ultimate escape  we were talking about the future  about our life on earth  about settling in the vicinity of a big city  we would never leave earth again  we would spend the rest of our lives under the blue sky and among the green trees  together we imagined the layout of our house  the layout of the garden  we argued over details  the location of a hedge or a bench    was i sincere for a moment  no  i knew that our plans were impossible  i knew that  for even if harey had been able to leave the station and survive the journey  how could i have got through the control barriers with my stowaway  earth is only for humans  and every human being must have proper papers  at the first checkpoint  harey would be detained  trying to establish his identity  we would be separated and harey would immediately betray himself  the station was the only place we could live together  did harey know this  she must have  had someone told her  one night i heard harey getting up slowly  i wanted to hold her back   in the darkness and silence we could still free ourselves for a moment from despair  escape torture by forgetting  harey had not noticed that i had woken up  when i reached out  she was already standing  barefoot  she was walking towards the door 

 i felt a confused anguish  and without daring to raise my voice  i whispered   harey     i sat down on the bed  i sat down on the bed  harey had gone out  leaving the door ajar  a thin wall of light cut obliquely across the room  i seemed to hear whispers  harey was talking with someone    with whom  i jumped out of bed  but a mad terror seized me  and my legs refused to move  i listened  but there was no sound  i let myself fall back on the sheet  blood pounded in my temples  i began to count  i had reached a thousand when the door panel swung open  harey entered  closed the door silently and stood still for a moment  i tried to breathe regularly  she called softly   kris  i didnt answer  she quickly crawled into bed and lay down beside me  careful not to touch me  i did not move  in my head i formed questions  but i refused to speak first  how long did i stay like that  asking silent questions  perhaps an hour  then i fell asleep  the morning was like so many other mornings  i watched harey on the sly  i saw no change in his behaviour  after breakfast we sat facing the large picture window  the station was sailing through the purple clouds  harey was reading a book  and as i stared ahead i suddenly realised that if i tilted my head at a certain angle i could see our double reflection in the glass  i took my hand off the bar  harey had no idea that i was looking at her through the glass  she glanced at me and  from my attitude  obviously judged that i was looking at the ocean  then she leaned forward to the bar and kissed the spot my hand had just touched  the next moment she was reading her book again    harey   i asked softly   where did you go last night    last night 

   yes  you    you dreamt it  kris  i didnt go anywhere    you didnt go out    no    you must have been dreaming    maybe    yes  maybe i dreamt    in the evening i started talking again about our journey  about returning to earth  harey interrupted me   dont talk to me about this trip anymore  kris  i dont want to hear any more about it  you know      what    no  nothing  when we were in bed  she told me she was thirsty   theres a glass of syrup on the table  would you give it to me  please  she drank half the glass  then handed it to me  i wasnt thirsty  she smiled   drink to my health  i drank the syrup  which seemed a little salty  but my mind was elsewhere    harey      she had just turned off the lamp    harey  since you dont want to talk about our trip  lets talk about something else    if i didnt exist  would you get married    no  never    never    why not    i dont know why  i was alone for ten years  and i never got married again  lets not talk about that  my dear    my head was spinning  as if i had drunk too much wine    no  lets talk about it  what if i begged you to do it    to marry me  what an absurd idea  harey  i dont need anyone but you  she leaned over me  her breath brushed my lips  she hugged me with all her strength   say it differently 

   i love you  her head fell on my arm  i felt tears    harey  whats wrong with you    nothing    nothing    nothing     she repeated  lower and lower  my eyes were closing  the red dawn woke me up  my head was heavy and my neck stiff  as if the vertebrae had fused together  my tongue was pasty and i swallowed a bitter saliva  what had i poisoned myself with  i reached for harey  my hand felt for a cold sheet  i jumped to my feet  i was alone   alone in the bed  alone in the cabin  the curved window reflected a row of red suns  i jumped to the floor  staggering like a drunken man  clinging to the furniture  i reached the sliding wardrobe  the bathroom was empty  the rotunda was empty  there was no one in the workshop    harey  waving my arms  i ran in all directions and called for him  one last time i shouted   harey  and my voice choked  i already knew the truth    i dont remember exactly what happened next  half naked  i ran from one end of the station to the other  i think i remember that i even entered the refrigeration plant  that i explored the warehouse shops  i was banging my fists against the locked doors  i would walk away and then come back and hit the doors that had already resisted me  i tumbled down the stairs  fell  got up  rushed i dont know where  forward    a glass wall slid open  i had reached the double armoured door that opened onto the ocean  i attacked the door  i shouted  i still hoped i was dreaming  for a moment  someone had been beside me  someone was grabbing me  dragging me    i found myself lying on a metal table in the small workshop  i was panting  alcohol vapour burned my nostrils and my throat  my shirt was soaked with ice water  my hair stuck to my head 

 snaut was busy in front of a medicine cabinet  stirring glass instruments and utensils  which clashed with an unbearable noise  suddenly i saw him standing over me  staring into my eyes    where is she    she is not here    he stooped and drew his face close and said slowly  very distinctly  harey is dead  i closed my eyes and whispered   she will come back  i didnt dread her return  i wished she would  i couldnt explain to myself why i had once tried to chase her away  why i had been so afraid of her return  he handed me a glass   here  drink this  i threw the entire contents of the glass in his face  he stepped back and wiped his eyes  when he opened his eyes again  i was standing over him with all my height  he was so small      its you    what are you talking about    no stories  you know what i mean  it was you she met the other night    and you told her to give me a sleeping pill    what happened to her  im listening  he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out an envelope  i snatched it out of his hand  it was stuck and had no writing on it  i tore the envelope open  it contained a sheet of paper folded in four  i recognised the handwriting  a large  irregular  slightly childish handwriting   my darling  i asked him  he is good  im sorry i had to lie to you  please do me this one favour  listen to him  and above all dont hurt yourself  you were wonderful 

 there was one last word  crossed out  but i could make it out  she had signed  harey   i read and re read the letter  i was fully lucid again  i wasnt going to scream hysterically  i had no voice  not even the strength to moan  finally i whispered   how    later  kelvin  calm down    i am calm  speak  what    by annihilation    but    what about the device    the roche device wasnt suitable  sartorius built another one  a new destabilizer  a miniature device with a range of a few metres    and she      she disappeared  a flash of light and a breath of air  a small puff of air  thats all    yes  we didnt have the materials to build a large device  the walls were leaning towards me  i closed my eyes    but    she    she will come back    no    what do you know    no  kelvin  she wont  remember those foamy wings  going up  they havent come back since that day    havent they    no  they havent  i said softly    you killed her      yes    if you were me  would you have done otherwise  i turned my back on him and started walking across the room  nine quick steps from the corner to the opposite wall  back again  nine more quick steps  i stopped in front of snaut   look  well write a report  well ask for an immediate link with the council  its a

 feasible  theyll agree  they must agree  the planet will no longer be subject to the regulations of the four  anything goes  well bring in antimatter generators  do you think theres any body that can withstand antimatter  there isnt  nothing resists antimatter  nothing  nothing  nothing    i screamed and tears blinded me    do you want to destroy it  why do you want to destroy it    go away  leave me    no  i wont go out    snaut    i stared at him  he shook his head    what do you want  what do you want from me  he moved back to the table    fine  well write a report  i started walking again    sit down   he ordered    leave me alone    there are two separate issues  first  the facts  second  our wishes    and we have to talk about that now    yes  now    i dont want to hear anything  do you understand  im not interested in your distinctions    we sent our last communique about two months ago  before gibarians death  wed have to establish exactly how it came about    i grabbed his arm    will you shut up  yes    hit me if you want  i wont shut up  i let go of him    oh  talk all you like      well  listen     sartorius will try to hide certain facts    im almost sure of it    and you wont hide anything    no  i wont  not any more  this case goes beyond personal responsibility  you know that as well as i do    he  has shown thoughtful activity  he is capable of organic synthesis at the highest level  a synthesis

 that we ourselves have never achieved  he knows the structure  the microstructure  the metabolism of our body      indeed    why do you stop talking  he has performed a series of experiments on us  psychic vivisection  he used knowledge  which he stole from us  without taking into account our aspirations    these are no longer facts  kelvin  or even propositions  they are hypotheses  in a sense  he has taken into account the desires locked away in some secret corner of our minds  perhaps he has sent us    gifts    gifts  good heavens  an irrepressible laugh shook me  i howled with laughter  snaut grabbed my hand    calm down  i squeezed his fingers  i heard the bones crack  he looked at me impassively  his eyelids wrinkled  i moved away and took refuge in a corner of the workshop  with my face turned towards the wall  i said    i will try to dominate myself    yes  of course    i understand  what do we ask of them    its up to you    i cant concentrate now    did she say anything before    no  she didnt  if you ask me  we now have a chance    a chance  what chance  a chance to    ah      again i looked him in the face and suddenly i understood    the contact  contact again  so youre not over the moon about this madhouse  what more do you need    contact  no  no and no  dont count on me    why not   he said calmly  you yourself  instinctively  and at this very moment more than ever  treat him like a human being  you hate him    and you dont    no  kelvin  no    he is blind    i repeated    blind  i wasnt sure i had heard correctly 

   or rather  he sees differently from us  we dont exist for him in the same way as we exist for each other  we recognise each other by the appearance of the face  the body    for him  this appearance is a translucent glass  it goes straight into the brain    well  so what  what are you getting at  if he has managed to recreate a human being who exists only in my memory  and in such a way that his eyes  his gestures  his voice    his voice      go on  speak    im talking    im talking    the voice    the voice    because he is able to read us like a book    do you understand what i mean    yes  that he could get along with us    isnt it obvious    no  its not obvious at all  he may have used a recipe that is expressed in other ways than words  as a record in the memory  this recipe is in the form of a protein structure  comparable to a zoosperm or an egg  in the brain  there are no words  no feelings  mans memory is a repertoire written in terms of nucleic acids on asynchronous large molecule crystals   he has picked up the deepest  most isolated  most assimilated imprint  without necessarily knowing what it means to us  lets say i am able to reproduce the architecture of a symmetriad  that i know the materials of which it is composed  and that i have the technological means to operate efficiently    i create a symmetriad and i throw it into the ocean  but i dont know why im doing this  i dont know what its for  i dont know what it means to him      yes  i say  maybe youre right  in that case  he didnt want to hurt us  he wasnt trying to destroy us    yes  thats possible  and without any intention    my lips began to tremble    kelvin    yes  yes  dont worry  you are good  and the ocean is good  everyone is good  but why  explain to me 

 why  why did he do it  what did you tell her    her    i told her the truth    the truth  the truth     what    you know what    come to my place  well write the report  come on  lets go    wait  wait  wait  what exactly do you want  you dont intend to stay in the station  do you    yes  i want to stay
