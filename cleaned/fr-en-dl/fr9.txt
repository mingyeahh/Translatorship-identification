i was lying in the darkened room  numb  i was staring   for how long    the luminous dial of the watch attached to my wrist  i could hear my breathing and felt a vague sense of astonishment  in fact  i was profoundly indifferent to this ring of glowing numbers and even to my astonishment  i attributed it all to fatigue   numbness  astonishment and indifference  i turned on my side  the bed seemed strangely large  i held my breath  there was no sound in the silence     why couldnt i hear him breathing  my arm went across the surface of the bed  i was alone  i was about to call to    when i heard footsteps  a tall  heavy man was approaching    i asked quietly        i asked quietly        yes  its me  dont turn on the lamp    dont you    it is not necessary  and it is better that we remain in the dark    but are you dead    dont worry about that  you recognised my voice  didnt you    yes  i did  why did you kill yourself    i couldnt help it  you arrived four days late  if you had arrived earlier  i might not have had to kill myself  but dont torment yourself  i dont regret anything    are you really here  im not asleep    ah  you think youre dreaming about me  like you thought you were dreaming about      where is it 

   why should i know where she is    i have a feeling you do    keep your feelings to yourself  lets say im replacing her    i wish she were here too    she cant be    why not  you know that its not really you who are here  that its only me      no  its really me who is here  its me again  but lets not waste our time with useless chitchat    will you go back    yes    and  then  will she come back    do you want her to  what is she to you    she belongs to me    you are afraid of her    no    you are repulsed by her      what do you want from me    you have a right to feel sorry for yourself  not for her  she will always be twenty years old  you know that very well  suddenly  for no specific reason  i calmed down  i listened to him calmly  it seemed to me that he had come closer and was now standing at the foot of the bed  i could not see him  the darkness was still impenetrable  i whispered   what do you want  after a moment he answered     has convinced   that you have fooled him  now they are trying to fool you  under the pretext of setting up an x ray emitting device  they are building a magnetic field annihilator    where is it    cant you hear what im saying  i came to warn you    where is it    i dont know where it is  watch out  youll need a weapon  you cannot count on anybody    i can count on    i heard a muffled noise  he was laughing 

   of course you can rely on her  to a certain extent  and  in the end  you can resort to the same expedient as me    you are not      oh  really  and who am i  a dream character    no  youre not  youre just a puppet  but you dont know that    and how do you know who you are  i wanted to get up  i couldnt move    was talking  i couldnt understand what he was saying  i could only hear the sound of his voice  i struggled desperately  trying to overcome the inertia of my body  a jolt and    i woke up  i sucked in the air greedily  it was night  i had been dreaming  it was a nightmare  and now i heard a distant  monotonous voice       a dilemma  which we are unable to resolve  we persecute ourselves  the polytheras only use a kind of selective amplifier of our thoughts  as soon as we try to find the motivation for these phenomena  we fall into anthropomorphism  where there are no men  there can be no motives accessible to man  in order to continue the research  one must annihilate either ones own thoughts or their materialized form  it is not in our power to annihilate our thoughts  as for annihilating their materialized form  that would be like murder  i recognised  s voice at once  i felt the sheet beside me  i was alone in bed  i had fallen asleep again  i was dreaming again    i called out to him      the voice stopped in the middle of a word  i heard a faint yelp and felt a draft on my face  i yawned   well     youre chasing me from dream to dream     i heard a rustle nearby  and raised my voice      the springs of the bed creaked  a voice whispered in my ear      its me 

   is that you     and                but he    you told me he was dead  in a drawl  i answered   he can live in a dream    i wasnt absolutely certain that i was dreaming    he spoke to me  he was here    i was terribly sleepy  if im sleepy  i thought  i might as well sleep  i brushed my lips over  s warm arm and settled back into the pillow    said something more  but i was already asleep  in the red light of the morning i remembered the events of the night  i had dreamed that i was talking with    but then    i had heard his voice  i could have sworn it  i couldnt remember exactly what he said  it was no longer a conversation  it sounded like a speech  a speech    was washing himself    was washing himself  the water was running in the bathroom  i looked under the bed  where a few days earlier i had hidden the tape recorder  it was gone         she pointed to her waterlogged face    you didnt see a tape recorder under the bed  a small pocket tape recorder    there were several things under the bed  i put everything on there  she pointed to a shelf next to the medicine cabinet and disappeared into the bathroom  i jumped down from the bed  my search was fruitless  when   left the bathroom  i said   you must have noticed that tape recorder  she didnt answer  she was doing her hair in front of the mirror  only then did i notice that she was pale and her eyes  when i met them in the mirror  expressed a suspicious curiosity  stubbornly  i resumed      the tape recorder is not on this shelf    dont you have anything more important to tell me  i mumbled   i beg your pardon  youre right  im stupid to make such a fuss about a tape recorder 

 no  dont argue  we went to breakfast    didnt behave the same as on other days  but i couldnt tell the difference  she looked around  many times  lost in thought  she did not hear what i said  and once  when she raised her head  i saw that her eyes were wet  i whispered   whats the matter  are you crying  she stammered   oh  leave me alone  these are not real tears  perhaps i should not have been satisfied with this answer  but i was not afraid of anything so much as of  sincere conversations   i had dreamed that   and   were plotting against me and  certain that i had only dreamed  i wondered if i would find any defensive weapons on the station  i was only concerned about having a weapon  not about what i would do with it  i told   that i had to inspect the storerooms and shops  silently  she followed me  i searched the crates  snooped in the capsules and  when i got to the bottom  i couldnt help but glance into the refrigeration plant  i did not want to let   in  i opened the door and looked around the room  the dark shroud covered an elongated form  from the door i could not see whether the black woman was still sleeping beside  s corpse  it seemed to me that she was no longer there  i could not find anything that suited me  i wandered from one shop to another and my mood became more and more gloomy  suddenly i saw that   had disappeared  she came back at once   she had lingered in the corridor  when it was so painful for her to lose sight of me  even for a moment  she had tried to get away from me  this should have surprised me  yet i continued to display an offended attitude   but who had offended me    and to behave  in truth  like a moron 

 i was suffering from a violent headache  in a rage  i emptied the contents of the medicine cabinet onto the floor   no trace of anti seizure pills  i didnt want to go back to the operating theatre  i didnt feel like anything  i had never been in a worse mood    glided like a shadow across the room  from time to time she would retreat somewhere   i dont know where  i didnt pay any attention to her   and then she would come back  in the afternoon  in the kitchen  we had just had lunch  but   had not actually eaten anything  i had not tried to encourage her to eat  because of my headache and lack of appetite     left her seat and came and sat down beside me  she pinched the sleeve of my blouse  i grunted   whats the matter  i had intended to go upstairs  for the pipes were crackling with echoes      it seemed  was fiddling with a high voltage device  but i should have taken   with me  it was difficult enough to justify his presence in the library  and he might provoke some unfortunate remark from   elsewhere  near the machines  i gave up trying to get out        she murmured   where are we now  i sighed in spite of myself  i was definitely not on a roll that day    everythings fine  why is that    i want to talk to you    well  im listening    not like this    what way  i have a headache  you know that  i have a lot of worries      show some good will     i forced myself to smile  it was surely a miserable smile    speak  my darling  please    will you tell me the truth  i frowned  i didnt like that preamble    why should i lie 

   you may have your reasons  serious reasons  but if you want me to    listen  dont tell me lies    i was keeping quiet    ill tell you something  and then youll tell me something too  well  but promise me youll tell me the truth  straight out    i avoided his gaze  which sought my eyes    i already told you  i dont know how i got here  maybe you do  wait a minute  wait a minute  maybe you dont know  but if you do know  and you cant tell me now  will you tell me one day  later  i wouldnt be any worse off  and youd at least give me a chance  a cold blood ran through my veins  i stammered    what are you talking about  my child    what chance       whoever i am  im certainly not a child  you promised to answer   whoever i am   my throat had closed up and i looked at    shaking my head stupidly  as if i was fighting to hear more    im not asking you to explain  it is enough that you tell me you are not allowed to speak  i answered in a hoarse voice   im not hiding anything from you     she stood up   very well  i wanted to say something  we couldnt leave it at that  but the words wouldnt come         standing in front of the window  she had her back to me  the blue black ocean stretched under a bare sky       if you think that       you know i love you      me  i came closer  i wanted to take her in my arms  she pulled away and pushed my hand away    you are too good   she said  do you love me  id rather you beat me       my darling    no  no  shut up  she returned to the table and gathered the plates  i looked out over the ocean  the sun was fading  the shadow of the station

 the sun was fading  the shadow of the station was lengthening and rippling with the waves    dropped a plate and it fell to the floor  water ran into the sink  an arc of tarnished gold encircled the russet firmament  if only i knew what to do  oh  if only i knew    suddenly there was silence    was standing behind me    no  dont turn round   she said in a low voice  youre not guilty of anything     i know that  dont torment yourself  i reached out to grab her  she ran to the back of the kitchen and lifted a pile of plates    its a pity theyre unbreakable  id gladly break them  id break them all  for a moment i thought she was really going to throw the plates on the floor  but she looked at me and smiled   dont be afraid  i wont make a scene  my mind was alert and i woke up in the middle of the night and sat up in bed  the room was dark  through the half open door  a faint light came from the rotunda  i heard a sinister hissing sound  accompanied by heavy  muffled knocks  as if some massive body was furiously striking a wall  a meteor had struck the stations shell  no  not a meteor  a rocket  for i heard a horrible  dragging moan    i shook myself  there was no rocket any more than there was a meteor  someone was moaning down the corridor  i ran in the direction from which the noise came  i saw a bright rectangle  the door of the small workshop was open  i rushed in  an icy vapour enveloped me  my breath fell like snow  white flakes swirled above a bathrobe  and under the dressing gown there was a body that rose weakly and hit the floor  the cloud of frost prevented me from seeing anything clearly  i threw myself on top of    i grabbed her by the arm  the dressing gown was burning my skin    continued to moan  i ran down the corridor  past several doors  i could no longer feel the cold  i could only feel the breath  which burned my neck like a flame 

 i laid   on the operating table and pushed aside the dressing gown     a miserable face  shaking with tremors  the lips were covered with a thick  black layer of frozen blood  the tongue glistened with ice crystals  liquid oxygen    the deware bottles piled up in the workshop contained liquid oxygen  shards of glass had crunched under my feet as i approached    how much oxygen had she drunk  it didnt matter  the windpipe  the throat  the lungs  everything was burnt  liquid oxygen eats away at flesh more surely than concentrated acids  breathing was weakening   a squeak  a dry sound of torn paper  her eyes were closed  it was agony  i examined the large glass cabinets  filled with instruments and medicines  a tracheotomy  an intubation  she had no lungs  medication  so much medicine  rows of coloured bottles and boxes lined the shelves  she was still moaning  a trickle of mist escaped from between her open lips  the thermophores    i started to look for them  then changed my mind  i ran to another cupboard  shaking boxes of ampoules  and now a syringe   where are the syringes  heres one that needs to be sterilised  i struggled in vain with the lid of the steriliser  my numb  insensitive fingers refused to fold back  the moaning grew louder  i leapt to    she had opened her eyes       it had not even been a whisper  i was speechless  my face was no longer mine  my lips did not obey me  i wore a plaster mask  i looked at    the ribs trembled under the white skin  the snow had melted and the wet hair had spread over the headrest  and   was looking at me       i couldnt say more  i stood there stiff as a log  my hands hanging down  unmoored from my body 

 my body  i felt a burning sensation  rising from my feet  climbing  attacking my lips  my eyelids  a drop of blood melted and ran down his cheek  drawing a slanting line  the tongue twitched and disappeared    continued to moan  i grabbed his wrist  there was no pulse  i put my ear under the left breast  against the cold body  i heard the din of a raging storm  and in the distance a gallop  the beating of the heart  so rapid that i could not count it  i remained bent over with my eyelids down  and something touched my head    had run his fingers through my hair  i sat up  she moaned      i took her hand  she responded with a bone crushing pressure  then she winced horribly and lost consciousness again  i could only see the whites of her eyes  a shrill roar ripped through her throat and convulsions shook her whole body  i struggled to hold her down on the operating table  she slipped away from me and her head hit the edge of a porcelain bowl  i caught her  i tried to control her  but every moment a violent spasm lifted her and she tore herself away from my embrace  i was dripping with sweat  my legs were wobbly  when the convulsions subsided  i tried to lay her down  she threw her chest forward and gasped for air  suddenly the eyes   s eyes  lit up that horrible bloody face         since when    since when     she choked  a pink foam rose to her lips  the convulsions returned  with the last of my strength i clung to her shoulders  she fell on her back  her teeth chattered  she gasped    no  no  no  she sighed hurriedly  and i thought the end was near  but the convulsions started again  and again i held her in my arms  from time to time she sucked in air with difficulty and all her ribs protruded  then the lids half closed over the blind eyes  she stiffened  this

 this time it was the end  i did not even try to wipe the foam from her lips  i heard a distant ringing  i waited for the last breath   then my strength would leave me completely and i would fall to the ground  she continued to breathe  the rattle was now only a faint hiss  the chest  which no longer quivered  began to move again with the rapid rhythm of the heartbeat  the cheeks became coloured  with my back arched  i contemplated her  i did not yet understand  my hands were clammy  a soft  supple material was blocking my ears  but i could hear the ringing still    lifted his eyelids and our eyes met  i wanted to say his name  but no sound came through my lips  my face remained dead  i still wore that heavy mask  i could only look at her  she moved her head  looked around the room  somewhere behind me  in another world  water was dripping from a poorly closed tap    leaned on an elbow  she sat down  i stepped back  she was watching me    what   she said   whats the matter  didnt it work  why are you looking at me like that    and suddenly a terrible scream  why are you looking at me like that  silence  she looked at her hands  wiggled her fingers    is that me   she asked  with my lips  in a breath  i said         she repeated       slowly  she let herself slide over the edge of the operating table  she staggered  regained her balance and took a few steps  she was in a stupor  she looked at me  but did not seem to see me        she repeated again  but i am not    who am i     and you  her eyes widened  shone and a surprised smile lit up her face    and you     maybe you are too   

 i was silent  i had backed up to the wall  i was leaning against a cupboard door  the smile faded    no   she said  no  you are afraid  but i cant stand this  i cant stand it  i didnt know what to do  even now  i dont understand anything  no  its impossible  she clenched her white knuckles and beat her chest    i didnt know anything  except that i was    do you think im acting  im not acting  i swear  im not acting  she moaned the last words and collapsed to the floor sobbing  something in me gave way  i leapt to her side and wrapped my arms around her  she struggled  pushed me away  sobbing without tears  and shouted    leave me  leave me  i disgust you  i know it  i dont want to  i dont want to  you can see that its not me  not me  not me    i shook her and shouted    shut up  kneeling in front of each other  we both screamed   s head came down on my shoulder  i clutched it with all my strength  we were both gasping for breath and not moving  the water dripped from the tap       tell me what i have to do to disappear       i shouted    shut up  she raised her head and looked at me   what  you dont know either  cant we do anything       please    i tried    no  no  leave me alone  i dont want you to touch me  i disgust you    thats not true    youre lying    i disgust you    and i also disgust myself    oh  if i could  if i could only    would you kill yourself 

   yes    and i dont want to  do you understand  i dont want you to die  i want you to be here with me  i want nothing else  the big grey eyes stared at me    youre lying   she said quietly  i let go of her and stood up  she just sat there    tell me what i have to do to make you believe me  i swear to you that i am not lying  only you exist  only you matter to me    it is impossible for you to tell the truth  because i am not      so who are you  she was silent for a long moment  several times  her chin trembled  at last she bowed her head and whispered     but i know its not true  i am not the one you once loved    indeed  but the past is gone  the past is dead  here  today  it is you that i love  do you understand  she shook her head    you are good  dont think i dont appreciate everything youve done  you did everything you could  but theres nothing to do  the first morning  when i was waiting beside your bed for you to wake up  i didnt know anything  only three days have passed  but it seems like a long  long time ago  i was acting like a crazy person  my head was full of fog  i couldnt remember anything  i wasnt surprised by anything   i felt like i did after a narcosis  or after a long illness  i even thought that maybe i had been ill  and that you didnt want to tell me  then certain events gave me pause for thought  you know what i mean  then you had that conversation in the library with that man   what was his name       yes  you refused to explain anything to me  so i got up at night and listened to the tape  i only lied that one time      when you were looking for the tape recorder  i knew where it was  i had hidden it  the man who recorded that tape   whats his name 

        yes     listening to him  i understood everything  although in truth i still dont understand anything  i just didnt know that i cant    that im not    that theres no end  he didnt say anything about that  maybe he did  but you woke up  and i turned off the tape recorder  i had heard enough to learn that i am not a human being  but an instrument    what are you saying    yes  to study your reactions  or something like that  each of you has a    an instrument like me  we come out of your memories  or your imagination  i dont know  besides  you know all this better than i do  if it didnt fit in with the rest  i certainly wouldnt have believed it    the rest    oh  the fact that i dont need to sleep  and that i have to follow you everywhere  only yesterday i thought you hated me and that made me unhappy  what an idiot  but how could i have imagined the truth  he     didnt hate this woman who was with him at all  but he talks about her in such a    such a terrible way  only then did i understand that nothing depended on me  that i could do this or that  it didnt matter  it would always be torture for you  worse than torture  because the instruments of torture are passive and innocent  as innocent as the stone that falls and kills you  that an instrument of torture should love you and wish you well was beyond my comprehension  i would have liked to tell you all this  to communicate the little i had understood  i thought it might be useful to you  i even tried to take notes    i cleared my throat and asked painfully    is that why you lit a lamp    yes  but i couldnt write anything down  i was looking for this    you know  this influence inside me    i was panicking  it seemed to me that i didnt have a body under my skin  that inside me there was something


 something    different  that i was just an appearance  meant to deceive you  do you understand    i understand    when you dont sleep at night  and you think for hours  you go very far with your thoughts  you know  and you go down strange paths      yes  i know    but i could feel my heart beating  and i remembered that you had analysed my blood  how is it  my blood  tell me  tell me the truth  now you can tell me the truth    your blood is the same as mine    is it    i swear to you    what does that mean  i thought that maybe this    this unknown thing was hiding somewhere inside me  that maybe it took up very little space  but i didnt know where it was hiding  now i think i was trying to find a subterfuge  because i didnt dare to decide  i was afraid  i was looking for another way out  but    if i have the same blood as you    if i really    no  its impossible  i would be dead already  wouldnt i  that means there is a difference  where is the difference  in the head  i suppose i think like any human being    and i dont know anything  if this unknown thing was thinking in my head  id know everything  and i wouldnt like you  i would be acting  knowing that i was acting       please tell me everything you know  maybe we can find a solution    what solution    she was silent    do you want to die    yes  i think so  again there was silence    sat there  withdrawn  i looked around the room  at the white enamel furniture  at the gleaming instruments  my eyes tried desperately to catch some hitherto unsuspected beacon that had suddenly revealed itself       can i say something too    she waited silently    its true  youre not exactly the same as me  but this is not a pejorative statement  at


 on the contrary  whatever your opinion on the subject  it is thanks to this    difference that you are not dead  she smiled a small  painful smile  the smile of a sad child    does that mean that i am    immortal    i dont know  in any case  you are much less vulnerable than i am  she murmured   thats awful      maybe not as awful as you think    but you dont envy me       i dont know what your    fate is  the truth is  your fate is as unpredictable as mine  as unpredictable as the fate of any of the stations inhabitants  the experiment will continue  and anything can happen      or nothing    or nothing  and i confess that i prefer that nothing happens  not because im afraid  although fear undoubtedly plays a part in this   but because there will be no outcome  of that i am absolutely certain    what outcome  you mean this    ocean  she shivered    yes  contact with the ocean  i think the problem is actually very simple  contact means the exchange of certain knowledge  certain notions  or at least certain results  certain states of affairs   but what if there is no exchange possible  if the elephant is not a giant microbe  the ocean is not a giant brain  on both sides  of course  attempts can be made  and the consequence of one of these attempts is that you are here  now  with me  and i am trying to explain to you that i love you  your presence alone erases the twelve years of my life that i have devoted to the study of solaris  and i wish to keep you with me  have you been sent to torture me  or to make my life sweeter  or are you just an instrument that does not know its function and is used to examine me as if through a microscope  are they using you to show me friendship  to strike me an insidious blow  or to mock me  perhaps all of these at once 

 or perhaps   and this is the most likely   it is something else  but why should we care about the intentions of our parents   even if our procreators are nothing alike  you will answer that our future depends on these intentions  and i will not contradict you  i cant predict the future any more than you can  i cannot even assure you that i will always love you  given what has happened  anything is to be expected  perhaps tomorrow i will be turned into a green jellyfish  nothing depends on us  but since it depends on us to make a decision today  lets decide to stay together  what do you say    listen  i would like to ask you again    do i    look a lot like him    you used to look a lot like him  now i dont know    i dont understand    she stood up and looked at me with her huge eyes    theres only you left    and youre sure its not her  that its only me  me that      yes  you  if you were really her  i might not be able to love you      why    because ive done something horrible    you were    mean to her    yes  when we      dont say anything    why not    so that you dont forget    so that you dont forget that its me whos here  and not her
