   is it because of the experiment 
i shrank back at the sound of her voice  i had been lying sleepless for hours  staring into the darkness  alone because i couldnt even hear her breathing  and in the convoluted labyrinths of nighttime thoughts  mayhem  half sense and taking on a new dimension and meaning because of it  i had forgotten about her 
  what    how do you know im awake       i asked  there was fear in my voice 
  by the way you breathe      she said quietly  somehow apologetically    i didnt want to disturb you    if you cant  dont say   
  no  why  yes  its that experiment  you guessed it 
  what do they expect from it 
  they dont know themselves  something  anything  its not operation think  its operation despair  now all it takes is one man to be brave enough and take responsibility for the decision  but this kind of bravery is considered by most to be mere cowardice  because it is retreat  you think  resignation  escape unworthy of a man  as if it were worthy of a man to wade in and get bogged down and drown in something he does not comprehend and never will 
i shrugged  but before my accelerated breathing could calm down  a new surge of anger shot out of my mouth    naturally  there is never a shortage of guys with a practical outlook  they said that even if we didnt make contact  by studying this plasma   all these crazy living cities that pop up 24 hours a day to disappear   wed learn the secrets of matter  as if they didnt know it was fooling ourselves  walking through a library  written in an incomprehensible language  that wed only be looking at the colours of the ridges     and how 
  arent there more planets like this 
  we do not know  maybe there are  we only know this one  in any case  it is something extremely rare  not like the earth  we  we are common  we are the grass of the universe  and we pride ourselves on this commonness of ours  that it is so common  and we thought everything could be accommodated in it  it was the kind of scheme with which we set off boldly and joyfully into the distance  other worlds  well  so what are these other worlds  master them or be mastered  there was nothing else in these hapless brains  ah  not worth it  not worth it 
i got up  searched the medicine cabinet in the dark for a flat jar of sleeping pills 
  im going to sleep  darling  i said  turning towards the darkness where a fan hummed high up    i need to sleep  otherwise i dont know myself   
i sat up on the bed  she touched my hand  i grasped it  unseen  and held it motionless until the strength of this embrace was loosened by sleep 
in the morning  when i woke up fresh and rested  the experiment seemed to me something trivial  i did not understand how i could attach such importance to it  also  the fact that   had to come with me to the laboratory mattered little to me  all her efforts became futile after my absence from the room for a few minutes  so i gave up on further attempts  which she insisted on  she was even ready to be locked up somewhere   and advised her to get herself a book to read 
more than the procedure itself  i was more interested in what i would find in the lab  apart from the rather significant gaps in the bookcases and analytical glass cabinets  moreover  some cabinets were missing glass  and the panel of one door was star cracked  as if a battle had been fought here recently  with the marks hastily but meticulously removed   there was nothing peculiar in this large  blue and white room     fiddling with the apparatus  behaved supremely correctly  accepted  s appearance as something quite ordinary and bowed slightly to her from a distance  while he was wetting my temples and forehead with physiological fluid    appeared  he entered through a small door leading into a dark room  he was in a white coat  with a black anti radiation apron imposed over it  which reached his ankles  spontaneous  sweeping  he greeted me as if we were one of the hundreds of employees of a great earthly institute and had parted the previous day  i noticed only now that the dead expression was given to his face by the contact lenses he wore under his eyelids instead of his glasses 
with his arms crossed over his chest  he stood   watching as   bandaged the electrodes applied to my head with a bandage that formed a kind of white cap  he circled the entire room with his eyes several times  as if not not noticing   at all  who  hunched over  unhappy  was sitting on a small stool against the wall pretending to read a book  when   stepped away from my chair  i moved my head  laden with metal and wires  to see him switch on the apparatus  but   raised his hand unexpectedly and spoke with an anointed expression 
  dr    please pay attention and concentrate for a moment  i do not intend to impose anything on you  for that would not lead to the goal  but you must stop thinking of yourself  of me  of your colleague    of any other individuals  so that  eliminating the randomness of individuality  you can focus on the cause we represent here  the earth and solaris  generations of researchers constituting a whole  even though individual people have their beginning and end  our tenacity in the pursuit of intellectual contact  the magnitude of the historical path traversed by humanity  the certainty of its extension in future time  the readiness to make all sacrifices and toil  to give all personal feelings to this mission of ours   this is the series of themes that should fill your consciousness most thoroughly  although the course of associations does not depend entirely on your will  the fact that you are here ensures the authenticity of the sequence i have presented  if you are not sure that you have fulfilled the task  please say so and my colleague   will repeat the transcript  after all  we have time   
he said the last words with a pale  dry smile that did not take away the expression of penetrating stupor in his eyes  i was squirming inwardly from the steak of these platitudes uttered so seriously  with such solemnity  fortunately   broke the protracted silence 
  may i       he asked  leaning with his elbow against the high panel of the electroencephalograph  in a careless and confidential pose at the same time  as if he were leaning against a chair  i was grateful to him for calling me by my first name 
  you can   i said  closing my eyes  the trepidation that had deserted my mind when he had finished attaching the electrodes and put his fingers on the switch had suddenly subsided  through my eyelashes i saw the pinkish glow of the control lights on the black plate of the camera  at the same time
the damp and unpleasant chill of the metal electrodes  like cold coins girdling my head  faded  i was like a grey  unlit arena  this emptiness was assisted on all sides by a crowd of unseen spectators  amphitheatrically summoned around a silence in which ironic contempt for   and the mission unraveled  the tension of the internal observers  desirous of playing an improvised role  was waning       i thought the word rehearsed  with nauseating anxiety  ready to withdraw it immediately  but this alert  blind audience of mine did not protest  for some moment i was all pure tenderness  sincere grief  ready for patient  long sacrifices    filled me without features  without shape  without face  and at once  through her impersonal  desperately tenderness breathing notion with all the solemnity of her professorial countenance  giese  the father of solaristics and solarists  swung to me in the grey darkness  but it was not the muddy outburst that i was thinking of  the stinking abyss that engulfed his golden spectacles and conscientiously brushed grey moustache  i saw only the copperplate on the title page of the monograph  the densely chalked background with which the artist had draped his head  that it stood unsuspecting almost in a halo  so similar not in features but in reliable  old fashioned consideration to my fathers face  and in the end i did not know which of them was looking at me  they both had no grave  a thing so common and ordinary in our time as to evoke no particular emotion 
the image had already disappeared  and for one moment  i dont know how long  i forgot about the station  about the experiment  about    about the black ocean  about everything  filled with a momentary like a flash of certainty that these two  no longer existing  infinitesimally small  into dried mud turned men  had lived up to everything that had befallen them  and the peace that flowed from this discovery was nullified by the formless crowd that surrounded the grey arena in silent expectation of my defeat  together with the double clack of the apparatus being switched off  artificial light entered my eyes  i squinted my eyelids  sarto rius was staring at me investigatively  still in the same pose     his back turned to him  was fiddling with the apparatus  deliberately as if crawling with trebles falling from his feet    do you think  dr    that you have succeeded    suspended his nasal  repulsive voice   
  yes  i said 
  are you sure of that    with a tinge of surprise or even suspicion chuckled   
  yes 
the certainty and the rough tone of my answer took him out of his rigid seriousness for a moment 
  thats     good   he mumbled and looked around as if he didnt know what to do now    walked over to the chair and started unwinding the bandages 
i got up and walked around the room  and meanwhile    who had disappeared into the darkroom  returned with the already developed and dried film  there were trembling  whitishly serrated lines stretching across several metres of tape  like some sort of mould or cobweb  unraveling along the black  slippery ribbon of celluloid 
i had nothing left to do  but i didnt leave  the two of them fed a film into the oxidised head of the modulator  the end of which   watched once more  distrustfully steeped  as if trying to decipher the content contained in those fluttering lines 
the rest of the experiment was already invisible  i only knew what was happening when they stood at the switchboards against the wall and activated the actual apparatus  the current awoke with a faint bass thud in the coil bank under the armoured floor  and then only the lights on the vertical glazed indicator tubes went down  indicating that the great tube of the x ray gun was lowering down the vertical shaft to rest in its open outlet  the lights then came to a standstill on the lowest bands of the scale and   began to increase the voltage until the pointers  or rather the white bars that replaced them  made a fanning half turn to the right  the sound of the electricity was barely audible  nothing was happening  the drums with the film rotated under the cover so that even that could not be seen  the meter ticked quietly like a clockwork mechanism 
  looked up from her book  then at me  then at them  i approached her  she looked at me questioningly 
the experiment was already coming to an end    walked slowly towards the big  conical camera head    shall we go       with her mouth alone    asked  i nodded my head  she stood up  without saying goodbye to anyone   it would have looked too pointless to me   i walked past   
the tall windows of the upper corridor were filled with a sunset of exceptional beauty  it was not the usual bleak  swollen red  but all shades of misty luminous pink  as if sprinkled with the tiniest silver  the heavy  inert wavering blackness of the infinite ocean plain seemed  responding to this soft glow  to flicker with a brownish violet  soft glare  only at the very zenith was the sky still fiercely red 
i stopped at once in the middle of the lower corridor  i couldnt think straight about the fact that wed be locked in a cabin again  like a prison cell  open to the ocean 
      i said   you know    i would have a look in the library    you dont mind       oh  id love to  ill look for something to read   she replied with a bit of artificial liveliness 
i felt that there was some unbridgeable rift between us since yesterday and that i should show her at least some cordiality  but complete apathy took over me  i dont know what would have to happen for me to snap out of it  we walked back along the corridor  then down the ramp we came to a small antechamber  there were three doors here  with flowers between them as if in some sort of display case behind crystal glass 
the middle door  leading into the library  was covered on both sides with a protuberant artificial skin  when opening it  i always tried not to touch it  inside  in the circular great hall  under a pale silver ceiling with stylised suns  it was slightly cooler 
i ran my hand along the spines of a set of solarian classics and was already about to take out the first volume of giese  with that copper plate likeness on the tissue covered preliminary sheet  when i unexpectedly discovered  unnoticed the previous time  a crackly  octavo volume of gravinsky 
i sat down on a cushioned chair  it was completely quiet  a step behind me    was leafing through a book of some sort  i could hear the light skimming of the pages under her fingers  gravinskys compendium  used most often in studies as a mere bric a brac  was a collection of alphabetically ordered solarian hypotheses  from abiological to degenerative  the compiler  who had probably never even seen solaris  dug through all the monographs  expedition protocols  excerpt papers and provisional reports  explored even citations in the works of plane tologists studying other globes  and produced a catalogue  a little frightening in the conciseness of its formulations  as they sometimes passed into triviality  having lost the subtle intricacy of the thoughts that patronised their birth  moreover  the whole thing  intended as an encyclopaedic work  already presented a rather curio value  the volume was published twenty years ago  and in the meantime  a mountain of new hypotheses had accumulated that could no longer be accommodated in a single book  i looked through the alphabetical list of authors as if it were a list of the fallen  hardly any of whom were still alive  probably none of whom were actively working in solar science  all this wealth of thought  scattered in all directions  gave the impression that one of the hypotheses simply had to be right  that it was impossible for reality to be quite different  different still from the myriads of proposals hurled at it  gravinsky prefaced the thing with a preface  in which he divided the known before him sixty less years of so laristics into periods  in the first one   dating from the initial examination of solaris   no one was actually making hypotheses in a conscious manner  it was assumed then  somehow intuitively  through  common sense   that the ocean was a dead  chemical conglomerate  a monstrous lump of jelly floating around the globe  bearing fruit in bizarre creations thanks to its  quasi volcanic  activity and the spontaneous automaticity of its processes stabilising its perishable orbit  just as a pendulum maintains an unchanging plane of motion once set  admittedly  as early as three years later  ma genon pronounced himself in favour of the animated nature of the  gelatinous machine   but gravinsky did not date the period of biological hypotheses until nine years later  when magenons previously isolated judgement began to gain more and more supporters  the following years were full of very intricate detailed theoretical models of the living ocean  supported by biomathematical analysis  the third was a period of disintegration of the hitherto almost monolithic opinion of scientists 
it saw the emergence of a multiplicity of sometimes fiercely opposed schools of thought  this was the time of the activities of panmaller  strobli  freyhouss  le greuille  osipovich  the whole gie sego legacy was then subjected to crushing criticism  it was then that the first atlases  catalogues  stereo photographs of asymmetries  hitherto considered impossible to study  were produced  the breakthrough came with new remote controlled devices that were sent into the turbulent depths of the colossi threatening to erupt at any second  it was then  on the fringes of the raging debates  that isolated  disdainfully silent mini malist hypotheses began to be put forward  proclaiming that even if the notorious  contact  with the  intelligent monster  could not be established  research into the ossifying mimoid cities and balloon like mountains that the ocean throws out to be explored would still be possible  which the ocean throws out in order to reabsorb them  will probably bring valuable chemical  physico chemical knowledge  new experience in the construction of molecule giants  but no one even entered into an argument with the proponents of such theses  this was  after all  the period in which the catalogues of typical metamorphoses  which are still valid today  or francks bioplasmic mathematical theory of mimoids  which  although abandoned as false  remained a splendid model of thoughtful impetus and logical construction  these total thirty odd years of gravinsky periods were a naive youth  a vigorously optimistic romanticism  and finally   marked by the first voices of scepticism   the mature age of so laristics  already at the end of the twenty five years  the hypotheses   as a recurrence of the first  colloid wo mechanistic ones   of the apsychicity of the sola ryan ocean were put forward as their late offspring  any search for manifestations of conscious will  for teleological processes  for action motivated by the oceans intrinsic needs  was almost universally acknowledged as some aberration of an entire generation of researchers  the publicists passion for debunking their claims prepared the ground for the sober  analytically minded  fact focused inquiries of the holden  eonides  stoliwa group  it was a time of rapid swelling and proliferation of archives  microfilm files  expeditions  richly equipped with every conceivable apparatus  self recorders  sensors  probes that earth could provide  in some years  more than a thousand people participated in the research at the same time  but while the rate of accumulation of materials was still increasing  the spirit animating the scientists was already waning  and a period of decline was beginning  difficult to distinguish in time  in this still optimistic phase of solarian exploration 
it was characterised above all by the great  courageous   at times with theoretical imagination  at times with negation   individualities of people such as giese  strobla or sevada  who  the last of the great solarists  died in mysterious circumstances near the south pole of the planet  having done something that does not even occur to a novice  he guided his gliding camera low over the ocean in front of hundreds of observers into the depths of the chige  which was clearly out of his way  there was talk of some kind of sudden weakness  fainting or rudder defect  in fact it was  i think  the first suicide  the first sudden  overt outburst of despair 
not the last  however  but gravinskys volume contained no such data  it was i myself who added dates  facts and details as i gazed into its yellowed pages  covered in fine print  there were no more such pathetic attempts on ones own life afterwards  nor were there any more of these great individuals  the recruitment of researchers  devoting themselves to a specific field of planetology  is actually a phenomenon not studied by anyone  people of great ability and great strength of character are born with more or less constant frequency  only their selection is uneven  their presence or absence in a particular field of research may perhaps explain the perspectives it opens up  although the classics of solar science can be judged in different ways  no one can deny their greatness  sometimes their genius  the best mathematicians  physicists  excellence in biophysics  information theory  electrophysiology were attracted to the silent giant of solar science for decades  suddenly  the army of researchers was stripped away year after year  as if the chiefs  what remained was a grey  nameless crowd of patient collectors  compilers  creators of many an original experiment  but there was a lack of both mass expeditions  intended on a global scale  and bold  unifying hypotheses 
solaristics seemed to be falling apart and  as if as a secondary  parallel to its downward flight  there were massively conceived hypotheses  barely differing in secondary details  about the degeneration  degeneration  involution of the solar seas  from time to time a bolder  more interesting take appeared  but all of them judged  as it were  the ocean  recognised as the final product of a development that had long ago  millennia ago  undergone a period of supreme organisation and was now  fused only physically  disintegrating into a multitude of unnecessary  meaningless  agonal creations  so already a monumental  centuries long agony  this is how solaris was perceived  by looking for signs of new creation in the longons or mimoids  by looking for manifestations of chaos and anarchy in the processes rolling over the liquid body  until this direction became an obsession  so that the entire scientific literature of the following seven or eight years  although  of the next seven or eight years  although obviously devoid of terms expressing the overt feelings of its authors  is like a single pile of insults   a revenge taken by the lonely  leaderless  grey masses of solarists on the still uniformly indifferent  ignoring their presence  object of intensive research  
i was aware of the original works of a dozen european psychologists  not included in this set of solar classics  perhaps wrongly  who had so much in common with solarism that over a long period of time they studied the reactions of public opinion  collecting the utterances of the most mediocre  the voices of the non professionals  and thus demonstrated a surprisingly close connection between the transformations of this opinion and the processes that were simultaneously taking place within the scientific community 
also within the co ordinating group of the planetary institute  where the material support of research was decided  transformations were taking place  expressed in a continuous but gradual reduction of the budget of the institutes and solar facilities  as well as of the subsidies for the teams going to the planet 
voices about the necessity of reducing research were mixed with speeches by those who demanded the use of more energetic means  but no one seemed to go further than the administrative director of the all earth cosmological institute  who insistently proclaimed that the living ocean by no means ignores people  it just doesnt notice them  just like an elephant   an ant walking on its back  and in order to draw its attention and concentrate it on us  it is necessary to apply powerful stimuli and ma na gigants on the size of the entire planet  the amusing detail was that  as the press mischievously pointed out  such costly undertakings were demanded by the director of the cosmological institute  not the planetological institute  which was funding the solarian exploration  so it was generosity from a pocket not its own 
and then the circle of hypotheses  the refreshing of old ones  the introduction of irrelevant changes  the clarification or  on the contrary  the ambiguisation began to turn the solar science  so clear up to then  despite its vastness  into an increasingly complicated labyrinth full of blind alleys  in an atmosphere of general indifference  stagnation and discouragement  a second ocean of barrenly printed papers seemed to accompany the solarist in time 
some two years before i entered gib rians studio as a graduate of the institute  the metta   irving foundation had been established  earmarking high prizes for whoever would harness the energy of the oceanic glee for human needs  this had been tempted before and more than one load of plasmatic jelly had been transported to earth by spacecraft  methods of preserving it have also been long and patiently developed  using high or low temperatures  an artificial microatmosphere and microclimate  solar like irradiation for fixation  thousands of chemical prescriptions  all in order to observe the more or less lazy process of decomposition  also  it is understood  like everything else  described repeatedly with the greatest precision in all its stages   self digestion  maceration  primary  i e  early  and late  secondary liquefaction  samples taken from all efflorescences and plasma formations also suffered an analogous fate  the only difference was in the paths leading to the end  which was represented by an ash light  metallic shining  auto fermentation diluted lichen  its composition  ratio of elements and chemical formulae could be given by any solarist awakened from sleep 
the complete failure to keep alive   or even in a state of suspended vegetation  some kind of hibernation   a small or large particle of the monster outside its planetary organism gave rise to the conviction  developed by the meunier and prophet school  that there is in fact only one secret to be unraveled  and when we open it with a suitably selected interpretative key  everything will become clear at once    
in the search for this key  this solaris philosophers stone  time and energy were consumed by people who often had nothing to do with science  and in the fourth decade of the solaristics existence the number of combination maniacs from outside the scientific community  these obsessives  with a fervour that beat their former predecessors  such as the prophets of  perpetual motion  or  squaring the circle   reached epidemic proportions  even alarming some psychologists  however  this passion died out after a few years  and by the time i was getting ready to travel to solaris  it had long since left the pages of the newspapers and disappeared from conversation  as had the matter of the ocean  setting gravinskys volume aside  i came across next to it  as the books were arranged alphabetically  a tiny pamphlet by grattenstrom  one of the more peculiar efflorescences of solaris writing  barely discernible between the thick spines  it was a work turned   in the struggle to understand the extraterrestrial   against human beings themselves  against man  a kind of lampoon on our species  a furious work in its mathematical dryness by a self taught scientist who  having first published a number of remarkable contributions to certain rather detailed and marginal branches of quantum physics  in this  his main  although barely a dozen or so pages long  most extraordinary work  he attempted to show that even the most seemingly abstract  most theoretical  mathematical achievements of science in reality only moved a step or two away from the prehistoric  coarse sensory  anthropomorphic understanding of the world around us  tracing in the formulas of the theory of relativity  the force field theorem  in parastatics  in the hypotheses of the one cosmic field  the traces of the body  all that is there as a derivative and effect of the existence of our senses  the structure of our organism  the limitations and frailties of the animal physiology of man  he reached
grattenstrom to the ultimate conclusion that no contact between man and a non human  ahumanoid civilisation can and will ever be possible  in this scathing attack on the entire species  not a single word of the thinking ocean was mentioned  but its presence  in the form of a contemptuously triumphant silence  could be felt under almost every sentence  at least  this is how i felt when i first encountered grattenstroms booklet  this work  by the way  was a curiosum rather than a solarianum in the normal sense  and it was in the classical book collection because it had been inserted into it by   himself  who  incidentally  had given it to me to read  with a strange  reverential like feeling  i slid the thin  unbound even print between the books on the shelf carefully  i touched the fingertips to the greenish brown solarian almanac  for all the chaos  all the helplessness that surrounded us  there was no denying that  thanks to several days of experience  we had gained certainty on a few fundamental questions over which a sea of ink had been wasted over the years  for they were subjects of disputes barren by their inconclusiveness 
whether the ocean was a living being could be doubted further by someone fond of paradoxes and stubborn enough  but it was impossible to deny the existence of its psyche  whatever could be understood under that word  it became obvious that he perceived all too well our presence above him     this single statement contradicted the entire elaborate wing of the solaristics claiming that the ocean is a  world within itself   an  entity within itself   deprived  due to the secondary disappearance of the once existing sensory organs  that it knows nothing of the existence of external phenomena or objects  enclosed in a whirlwind of gigantic thought currents  whose seat  bed and creator is its under two suns whirling abyss 
and further  we learned that he was able to synthesise artificially what we ourselves could not   our bodies   and even to perfect them by introducing into their sub atomic structure incomprehensible changes standing  presumably  in relation to his aims 
so he existed  lived  thought  acted  the chance to reduce the  solaris problem  to nonsense or to zero  the judgement that we are not dealing with any being  and thus our defeat is by no means a defeat   all this fell away once and for all  whether they wanted it or not  humans now had to acknowledge a neighbourhood which  though behind trillions of kilometres of vacuum  separated by a space of whole light years  lay in the paths of their expansion  more difficult to comprehend than the rest of the universe 
we are  perhaps  at the turning point of all history  i thought  the resolve to give up  to retreat  either current or in the near future  might have taken hold  even the abolition of the station itself i did not consider impossible or even improbable  however  i did not believe that anything could be saved in this way  the mere existence of a thinking colossus will never give people peace again  no matter how much they traverse the galaxies  no matter how much they bond with other civilisations of beings similar to us  solaris will be an eternal challenge thrown to man 
and another small  leather bound volume strayed into the depths of the annuals of the almanac  i stared for a moment at the cover  darkened by the touch of my fingers  before i opened it  it was an old book  this introduction to so laristics by muntius  and i remembered the night i had spent on it  and  s smile when he gave me that copy of his  and the earthy dawn in the window when i reached the word end  solaristics  muntius wrote  is a substitute for space age religion  it is faith clothed in the garb of science  the contact  the goal towards which it aims  is as vague and dark as the communion of saints or the descent of the messiah  exploration is an existential liturgy in methodological formulas  the humble work of exploration is an expectation of fulfilment  of annunciation  for there are and can be no bridges between solaris and earth  this obviousness  like others  the lack of shared experience  the lack of concepts that can be communicated  solarists reject  just as believers rejected arguments that refuted the basis of their faith  after all  what do people expect  what can they expect from establishing informational communication with the thinking seas  a record of experiences  associated with an existence that does not end in time  so old that it probably does not remember its own beginning  a description of desires  passions  hopes and sufferings  released in the momentary birth of living mountains  the transformation of mathematics into existence  of loneliness and resignation   into completeness  but all this constitutes incommunicable knowledge  and if one tries to translate it into any of the earthly languages  all the sought after values and meanings are lost  left on that side  such revelations  worthy of poetics rather than science  are not what the  believers  are expecting  no  because they themselves  without realising it  are waiting for the revelation  which would give them the meaning of man himself  solaristics is thus a graveyard of long dead myths  an efflorescence of mystical longings which human lips no longer dare to utter openly  in full voice  and the cornerstone hidden deep within the foundations of its edifice is the hope of redemption    
but incapable of admitting that this is really the case  the solarists painstakingly bypass any interpretation of the contact  so that it becomes in their writings something definitive   and while in the original  still sober understanding it was supposed to be a beginning  an introduction  an entrance to a new path  one of many   beatified  it became years later their eternity and heaven    
simple and bitter is the analysis of muntius  that heretic of planetology  dazzling in its negation  in its dismantling of the solarian myth or  rather  of the mission of man  the first voice that dared to sound out  still in the confident and romantic phase of the development of solar science  was received with a total  ignorant  silence  this was all too understandable  since accepting muntius words was tantamount to crossing out solar science as it existed  the beginnings of another  sober  resigned one waited in vain for its founder  five years after muntiuss death  when his book had already become a bibliographical rarity  a white raven  not to be found either in so larian sets or in philosophical book collections  a school named after him was founded  a norwegian circle in which  broken up by the individuality of the thinkers taking up his legacy  the serenity of his lecture turned into the biting  fierce irony of erle ennesson  and  in a somewhat trivialised edition  into the utilitarian solarism or utilitarianism of phaelan gi  phaelan gis demand was to concentrate on the concrete benefits that could be derived from research  without looking at some pipe dream  born of false hopes  aiming at civilisational contact  an intellectual communion of two civilisations  in the face of the relentless clarity of muntius analysis  however  the writings of all of his spiritual disciples remain nothing more than przy czynarski  if not mere popularisation  with the exception of the works of ennesson and perhaps takata  he himself had already accomplished virtually everything  calling the first phase of solaristics   the period of the prophets  among whom he counted giese  holden  sevada  the second he called the great schism   the disintegration of the one solo rian church into a cluster of warring denominations  and he predicted the third phase   the dogmatisation and scholastic ossification that would follow when everything there was to examine had been examined  this  however  did not happen     i thought  was right  however  to regard muntiuss liquidating argument as a monumental simplification that overlooked everything in solar science that contradicted the elements of faith  as it was decided by the perpetual temporality of the work  which promised nothing beyond a concrete  material globe orbiting two suns 
wedged into muntiuss book was  folded in two  a yellowed quite print from the quarterly journal parerga solariana  one of the first papers   had written  even before he became head of the institute  the title    why i am a solarist    was followed by a succinct  almost dispatch like enumeration of specific phenomena justifying the existence of a real chance of contact  for   belonged to that  perhaps  last generation of researchers who had the courage to refer to the early years of splendour  optimism  and did not disavow a peculiar faith that transcended the limits set by science  as material as it was  because it trusted in the success of efforts  if only sufficiently persistent and continuous 
it emerged from the so familiar  classic studies of bioelectronicists from under eurasia  cho  en min  ngyali and kawakadze  these showed elements of similarity between the image of the electrical workings of the brain and certain discharges  occurring within the plasma  that preceded the formation of such plasma creations as the early polymorpha and the twin solarids  he rejected overly anthropomorphic interpretations  all those mystifying theses of the psychoanalytic  psychiatric and neurophysiological schools that attempted to reinterpret into a glial ocean individual human disease entities  such as epilepsy  whose analogue was supposed to be spasmodic eruptions of asymmetries   because he was   of the proponents of contact   one of the most cautious and sober  and suffered nothing so much as the sensationalism that  admittedly extremely rarely anymore  accompanied this or that discovery  a wave of similar cheapest interest was  moreover  awakened by my thesis  and here it was  out of print of course  stuck somewhere in one of the microfilm trays  i based it on the revealing studies of bergmann and reynolds  who succeeded in isolating and  filtering out  from the mosaic of colourful processes the components accompanying the strongest emotions   despair  pain  delight   and in turn juxtaposed these records with the discharge of ocean currents and detected oscillations and opacifications of the curves  on certain parts of the syme triad canopy  at the base of immature mimoids  etc   manifesting a noteworthy analogy    manifesting a noteworthy analogy  this was enough for my name to appear imminently in the tabloid press under clownish titles like jelly despairs or planet in orgasm  but it worked out in my favour  so i thought  at least until recently   because    who  like every other solar scientist  did not read all the works appearing by the thousands  especially those already new to the field  took notice of me and i received a letter from him  this letter closed one  and opened a new chapter of my life
