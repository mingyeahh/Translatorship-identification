the tube corridor was empty  i stood for a moment in front of the closed door  listening  the walls must have been thin  there was a whine of wind coming from outside  on the panel of the door there was a rectangular piece of plaster with a pencil inscription stuck a little obliquely  carelessly   man   i stared at the scribbled indistinct word  for a moment i wanted to go back to    but i realised that was impossible 
the maddening warning still sounded in my ears  i moved and my shoulders were bent by the unbearable weight of the suit  silently  as if i were hiding involuntarily from an unseen observer  i returned to a circular room with five doors  on them were plaques  dr    dr    dr    there were none on the fourth  i hesitated  then pressed the handle lightly and opened them slowly  as they swung open  i experienced a feeling bordering on certainty that someone was there  i stepped inside 
there was no one there  the same  only slightly smaller  convex window pointed out at the ocean  which here   under the sun   glistened greasily  as if reddened oil was flowing from the waves  the scarlet glare filled the entire room  similar to a ships cabin  on one side stood shelves with books  between them  clipped vertically to the wall  a bed fixed on gimbals  on the other side was full of cupboards  hanging between them on nickel plated frames were striped aerial photographs  in metal holders were flasks and test tubes crammed with cotton wool  under the window white enamelled boxes were arranged in two rows so that one could barely pass between them  the lids of some were tilted   they were filled with a lot of tools  plastic hoses  in both corners there were taps  a fume hood  behind freezers  the microscope stood on the floor  there was no more room for it on the big table next to the window  when i turned around  just by the entrance door i saw a ceiling length  unclosed wardrobe full of overalls  work and protective aprons  underwear on the shelves  aluminium bottles for portable oxygen apparatuses glittered between the uppers of over heated shoes  two devices and their masks dangled  hooked to the railing of a raised bed  everywhere there was the same roughly ordered chaos  as if in a hurry  i drew in the air investigatively  sensed a faint scent of chemical reagents and a trace of a pungent odour   could it be chlorine  instinctively  i searched with my eyes for the grilled ventilation outlets in the ceiling corners  strips of paper stuck to their frames fanned gently as a sign that the compressors were working  maintaining normal air circulation  i moved the books  apparatus and tools from the two chairs into the corners  pushed them together as best i could until there was a relatively empty space around the bed between the cupboard and the shelves  i pulled the stand to hang the jumpsuit on it  took the zip handles in my fingers  but immediately let them go  somehow i couldnt bring myself to drop the suit  as if that would make me vulnerable  once more i took in the whole room with my eyes  checked that the door was properly latched  and since there was no lock on it  after a brief hesitation i pushed the two heaviest boxes towards it  having barricaded myself in this makeshift manner  with three jerks i extricated myself from my heavy  creaking shell  a narrow mirror on the inner surface of the wardrobe reflected part of the room  out of the corner of my eye i caught some movement there  i jerked up  but it was my own reflection  the leotard under the jumpsuit was sweaty  i threw it off and pushed open the wardrobe  it moved away  in the alcove behind it the walls of a miniature bathroom glowed  on the floor beneath the ink rested a large  flat cassette  i carried it not without difficulty into the room  as i set it on the floor  the lid sprang open as if on a spring and i saw compartments filled with bizarre artefacts  full of tools roughly caricatured or sketched in dark metal  partly analogous to those that lay in the cupboards  they were all unusable  undeformed  rounded  over melted  as if brought out of a fire  strangest of all  the same shape of destruction even wore the ceramite  so practically non melting handles  in no laboratory furnace would it be possible to reach their flaming temperatures   except inside an atomic stack  i retrieved a small ray indicator from the pocket of my dishevelled jumpsuit  but the black muzzle was silent as i approached the remains 
i was wearing only briefs and a mesh t shirt  i threw both on the floor like rags and jumped naked under the ink  the impact of the water felt like a relief  i wriggled under the downpour of hard  hot streams  massaging my body  scabbing  all of it somehow exaggerated  as if i were shaking it off  expelling all the murky  suspicion infested insecurity that filled the station  i searched in the wardrobe for a lightweight workout outfit that could also be worn under a jumpsuit  put all my scanty possessions in my pocket  between the pages of my notebook i felt something hard  it was an unaccountably misplaced key from my earthly abode  which i turned for a while in my fingers  not knowing what to do with it  finally  i placed it on the table  it occurred to me that  perhaps  i might need a weapon of some kind  it certainly wasnt an all purpose pocket knife  but i didnt have anything else  and i wasnt yet in such a state of mind as to start looking for some kind of ray thrower or something  i sat down on a metal chair in the middle of an empty space  away from all things  i wanted to be alone  i was pleased to find that i still had more than half an hour of time  its hard  its my nature to be meticulous in observing any and all  important or unimportant  commitments  the hands on the twenty four hour clock face stood at seven oclock  the sun was setting  seven oclock local time was prometheus twenty decks  solaris must have already dwindled to the size of a spark on moddards screens and was indistinguishable from the stars  but what could i care about prometheus  i closed my eyes  there was complete silence  if one did not count the meowing of the pipes that sounded at regular intervals  the water cycled quietly in the bathroom  dripping onto the porcelain 
  was dead  if i understood what   was saying correctly  it was barely a dozen hours since his death  what did they do with the body  did they bury it  true  on this planet that could not be done  i pondered this matter of factly for a long moment  as if the fate of the dead was paramount  until  having realised the nonsensical nature of these musings  i stood up and began to walk diagonally across the room  nudging with the end of my foot a disorderly scattering of books  some small  empty field bag  i bent down and picked it up  it was not empty  it contained a flask of dark glass  as light as if it had been blown out of paper  i looked through it to the window  into the bleakly reddening  smoky dirty mists of the last light of the west  what was happening to me 
why was i preoccupied with any nonsense  any unimportant trifle that fell into my hand 
i twitched as the light came on  a photocell  of course  sensitive to the falling dusk  i was filled with anticipation  the tension building up to the point where i didnt want an empty space behind me  i decided to fight it  i moved my chair over to the shelves 
i pulled out the all too familiar second volume of hughe s and eugel s old monograph the history of solaris and began to leaf through it  having supported the thick  stiff spine on my knee 
the discovery of solaris took place almost a century before i was born  the planet orbits two suns   a red one and a blue one  for forty years  no ship came close to it  in those days  the ga mov shapley theory of the impossibility of life on the planets of double stars was taken for granted  the orbits of such planets are constantly changing due to the gravitational play occurring when a pair of suns orbit each other  the resulting perturbations alternately shrink and stretch the planets orbit and the beginnings of life  if they arise  are destroyed by radiant heat or icy cold  these changes take place over a period of millions of years  so   according to the astronomical or biological scale  because evolution requires hundreds of millions  if not billions of years    in a very short time 
according to the original calculations  solaris was to approach its red sun in five hundred thousand years at a distance of half an astronomical unit  and after a further million years to fall into its glowing abyss 
but after only a dozen years or so  it was found that its track did not show the expected changes at all  quite as if it were constant  as constant as the tracks of the planets in our solar system 
observations and calculations were repeated  now with the utmost accuracy  which only confirmed what was known  that solaris has an unsteady orbit 
from one of the several hundred planets discovered each year  which  with a few lines of notes giving the elements of their motion  are drawn into the great statistics  solaris was then promoted to the rank of a body worthy of special attention 
thus  four years after this discovery  it was circumnavigated by the ottenskjold expedition  which explored the planet with laokoon and two accompanying support ships  this expedition had the character of a makeshift  improvised reconnaissance  especially as it was incapable of landing 
it put more automatic observer satellites into equatorial and polar orbits  whose main task was to measure gravitational potentials  in addition  it surveyed the planets surface  almost entirely covered by ocean  and the few plateaus that rise above its level  their combined surface area does not match that of europa  although solaris is twenty per cent larger in diameter than earth  these patches of rocky and desert land  scattered irregularly  are mainly concentrated in the southern hemisphere  the composition of the atmosphere  which is devoid of oxygen  was also learned  and the planets density  as well as its albedo and other astronomical elements  were measured with excessive accuracy  as expected  no traces of life were found either on the landmasses or spotted in the ocean 
over the next ten years  solaris  now at the centre of attention of all observatories in the region  showed an astonishing tendency to maintain its beyond all doubt gravitationally unstable orbit  for some time  the matter smelled of scandal  as attempts were made to blame  for the sake of science  either certain people or the calculating machines they used for such an observational result 
lack of funds delayed the sending of a proper solar expedition for a further three years  until shannahan  having completed the crew  obtained three c class spacecraft from the institute  a year and a half before the arrival of the expedition  which launched from the aquarius alpha area  a second exploration fleet launched an automated sateloid  luna 247  into a circumbinary orbit on behalf of the institute  this sateloid  after three successive reconstructions separated by decades  is still in operation today  the data it collected conclusively confirmed the ottenskjold expeditions observation of the active nature of the oceans movements 
one shannahan ship remained in high orbit  while two  after initial preparations  landed on a rocky patch of land that covers about six hundred square miles off the south pole of solaris  the expeditions work was completed after eighteen months  proceeding successfully except for one unfortunate accident caused by malfunctioning instruments  however  the scientific team split into two opposing camps  the subject of the dispute became the ocean  on the basis of analyses  it was regarded as an organic entity  no one dared to call it alive at that time   biologists  however  saw it as a primitive formation   a kind of gigantic anastomosis  as it were  a single liquid cell  but they called it a  prebiological formation    which surrounded the entire globe with a gelatinous mantle  with a depth of several miles in places   astronomers and physicists argued that it must be an extraordinarily highly organised structure  perhaps beating the complexity of terrestrial organisms  if it could actively influence the formation of the planetary orbit  no other cause explaining the behaviour of solaris was detected  and moreover  planetophysicists detected a link between certain processes of the plasmatic ocean and the locally measured gravitational potential  which varied according to the oceanic metabolism 
thus physicists  not biologists  put forward the paradoxical phrase plasmatic machine understanding it to mean a creature  in our sense perhaps not animate  but capable of taking purposeful action on an   let us add at once   astronomical scale 
in this dispute  which like a whirlpool drew in all the most eminent authorities within weeks  the gamow shapley doctrine was shaken for the first time in eighty years 
some time later  it was still attempted to defend it with the claim that the ocean had nothing to do with life  that it was not even a para  or prebiological creation  but a geological formation  probably unusual  but only capable of fixing the orbit of solaris through changes in gravity  le chateliers rule was invoked 
in spite of this conservatism  hypotheses grew up  proclaiming  such as one of the better elaborated by civita vitty  that the ocean is the result of a dialectical development  behold  from its primordial form  from a praoceane  a solution of lazily reacting chemical bodies  it managed  under the pressure of conditions  that is  the orbital changes threatening its existence   without the mediation of all terrestrial levels of development  so bypassing the emergence of unicellular and multicellular organisms  plant and animal evolution  without the birth of a nervous system  of a brain  to leap immediately into the stage of a  homeostatic ocean   in other words  it did not adapt itself like terrestrial organisms over hundreds of millions of years to its environment  only to give rise to a rational race after such an enormous period of time  but it mastered its environment at once 
this was not at all original  only that no one still knew how a syrupy jelly could stabilise the orbit of a celestial body  for almost a century  devices creating artificial force and gravitational fields   gravitators   had been known  but no one had even imagined how an amorphous ooze  the result   in gravitators   of complicated nuclear reactions and enormous temperatures  could be perfected  newspapers  which at that time  to the curiosity of readers and to the horror of scientists  were full of the most unsophisticated inventions on the subject of the  mystery of solaris   did not lack such claims that the planetary ocean is    a distant relative of earths electric eels 
when the problem was  to some extent at least  solved  it turned out that the explanation  as was sometimes the case with solaris afterwards  replaced one mystery with another  perhaps even more astonishing 
the research showed that the ocean is by no means acting on the principle of our gravitators  which would be impossible anyway   but is able to directly model the metrics of space time  leading  among other things  to deviations in the measurement of time on one and the same solaris meridian  thus  the ocean not only knew in a sense  but was even able  which cannot be said of us  to exploit the consequences of einstein boevi theory 
when this was said  one of the most violent storms of our century erupted in the scientific world  the most venerable theories  universally accepted as true  collapsed into rubble  the most heretical articles appeared in the scientific literature  and the alternative of brilliant ocean or gravitational jelly fired up all minds 
all this was happening a good dozen years before i was born  by the time i went to school  solaris   thanks to facts learned later   was already widely recognised as a planet endowed with life   only with a single inhabitant    
the second volume by hughes and eugel  which i was still leafing through almost mindlessly  began with a systematisation  as original as it was amusing  the classification table presented in turn  type   polytheria  order   syncytialia  class   metamorpha 
it was as if we knew god knows how many specimens of the species  when in reality there was still only one  admittedly weighing seventeen trillion tonnes 
colourful diagrams  colourful graphs  analyses and spectral spectra flitted under my fingers  demonstrating the type and rate of basic transformation and its chemical reactions  the further i delved into the bulky volume  the more mathematics flashed across the chalky pages  one would  think  that our knowledge of this representative of the metamorph class  who lay  shrouded in the darkness of a four hour night  a few hundred metres below the steel floor of the station  was complete  in fact  not everyone was yet in agreement as to whether it was a creature  let alone whether the ocean could be called rational  i put the large volume on the shelf with a clatter and brought out another  it was divided into two parts  the first was devoted to a summary of the experimental protocols of all those myriad ventures to make contact with the ocean  this making of contact had been  i remembered all too well  a source of endless anecdotes  mockery and jokes during my studies  the medieval scholasticism seemed a lucid  glowingly obvious lecture in the face of the jungle that the issue had spawned  the second part of the volume  almost one thousand three hundred pages long  was occupied by the subject bibliography alone  the original literature would certainly not have fit in the room where i was sitting 
the first attempts at contact were made via special electronic apparatuses  transforming the stimuli  sent in both directions  the ocean took an active part in shaping these apparatuses  but all this took place in complete darkness  what did he mean by  taking part   it was modifying certain elements of the submerged devices  with the result that the recorded rhythms of the discharges were changing  the recording apparatuses were capturing a myriad of signals  as if snippets of some giant action of higher analysis  but what did it all mean  perhaps they were data on the oceans momentary state of agitation  perhaps impulses  causing its giant creations  somewhere  thousands of miles away from the researchers  perhaps translated into undated electron constructs   reflections of the eternal truths of this ocean  perhaps his works of art  who could know  since it was impossible to get the same response to a stimulus twice  if once the response was an explosion of impulses  almost bursting the apparatuses  and once a deafening silence  since no experiment could be repeated  it still seemed that we were just a step away from deciphering this ever growing sea of records  after all  electronic brains with a processing power of information that no problem had ever required had been built specifically for this purpose  indeed  some results have been obtained  the ocean   a source of electric  magnetic  gravitational impulses   spoke as if in the language of mathematics  certain sequences of its current discharges could be classified  using the most abstract branches of terrestrial
analysis  the theory of multiplicity  there appeared homologues of structures known from that branch of physics which deals with the consideration of the mutual relation of energy and matter  finite and infinite quantities  particles and fields   all this led the scientists to believe that they had a thinking monster before them  that it was a kind of millionfold expanding  girdling the whole planet  a protoplasmic mo machine brain  which is wasting its time with incredible in its breadth theoretical reflections on the essence of all things  and all that our apparatus catches are small  accidentally overheard fragments of this gigantic monologue going on eternally in the depths  surpassing all our understanding  so much for mathematicians  such hypotheses have been described by some as an expression of disregard for human capabilities  as falling on ones face before something we do not yet understand  but which can be understood  as bringing the old doctrine of  ignoramus et ignorabi nius  out of the grave  others again considered them to be harmful and idle nonsense  that in these hypotheses of mathematicians  the mythology of our times manifests itself  seeing in the giant brain   whether electron or plasmatic  it is all the same   the supreme goal of existence   the sum of being 
and others still     but the researchers and views were legion  what  after all  was the whole field of trying to make contact compared to other branches of solar science  in which specialisation had progressed so far  especially over the last quarter of a century  that it was almost impossible for a so larist cyberneticist to communicate with a solar scientist symbolist   how can you communicate with the ocean if you can no longer do so among yourselves     once jokingly asked veubeke  who was then  during my studies  the director of the institute  there was much truth in this joke  for it was also no accident that the ocean was classified in the metamorph class  its undulating surface could give rise to the most disparate  earth like forms  while the purpose   adaptive  cognitive or whatever   of these sometimes violent eruptions of plasmatic creativity was a complete mystery  putting the volume  so heavy that i had to hold it with both hands  on the shelf  i thought that our knowledge of solaris  filling the libraries  is useless ballast and a quagmire of facts  and we are in the same place where it started to accumulate  seventy eight years ago  and actually the situation was much worse  because all the effort of those years turned out to be in vain 
what we knew exactly included mere denials  the ocean did not use or build machines  although in certain circumstances it seemed capable of doing so  since it duplicated parts of some of the apparatuses immersed in it  but it did so only during the first and second years of exploration work  after that  it ignored all repeated attempts with benedictine patience  as if it had lost for our devices and products  and it would appear that for us too     all interest  he did not have   i continue enumerating our  negative news    no nervous system or cells  no protein like structure  it did not always respond to stimuli  even the most powerful ones  so  for example  it completely  ignored  the crash of the auxiliary rocket ship of the second giese expedition  which plummeted from a height of three hundred kilometres onto the planets surface  destroying a mile and a half radius of plasma with the explosion of its atomic stacks  
slowly  in scientific circles  the solaris affair began to sound like a lost cause  especially in the scientific spheres of the institutes administration  where voices were raised in recent years demanding that grants for further research be cut  so far  no one has dared to talk about closing down the station altogether  it would be too open an admission of defeat  in fact  some people  in private conversations
 in private conversations  said that all we needed was a strategy of withdrawing from the solaris affair as honourably as possible 
for many  however  and especially for the young  this  affair  was slowly becoming something of a touchstone of self esteem   in essence   they said   there is more at stake than the exploration of solaris civilisation  for the game is about ourselves  about the limits of human cognition  
for some time there was a popular view  fervently disseminated by the daily press  that the thinking ocean  which surrounds the whole of solaris  is a gigantic brain  surpassing our civilisation by millions of years of development  that it is some kind of  cosmic yoga   a sage  an embodied omniscience  which has long since understood the futility of all action and therefore maintains a categorical silence towards us  this was simply untrue  for the living ocean acts  and acts as it still does  only according to non human concepts  so it does not build cities  nor bridges  nor flying machines  nor does it try to conquer space or transcend it  in which some defenders of human superiority saw an invaluable asset for us at all costs   but deals with a thousand transformations    ontological self morphosis    and there is no shortage of scientific terms in solaristic works  since  on the other hand  a person who persistently reads into all possible solarist works is overwhelmed by the irresistible impression that he has before him fractions of intellectual constructions  perhaps brilliant  mixed without order or composition with the products of some complete  bordering on insanity  stupidity  the idea of  ocean yoga  arose as the antithesis of the concept of  ocean debil  
these hypotheses brought out of the grave and revived one of the oldest philosophical problems   the relation of matter and spirit  of consciousness  it took considerable courage to attribute consciousness to the ocean for the first time   as du haart did  this problem  hastily declared metaphysical by methodologists  smouldered at the bottom of almost all discussions and disputes  is it possible to think without consciousness  but can the processes taking place in the ocean be called thinking  is a mountain a very large stone  is a planet a huge mountain  these names can be used  but the new scale of size brings new regularities and new phenomena to the stage  this problem has become the square circle of our time  every independent thinker has tried to contribute to the treasury of solaristics  theories have proliferated proclaiming that we have before us the product of a degeneration  a backsliding that has followed the oceans bygone phase of intellectual splendour  already that the ocean is in fact a tumour glial  which  having been born within the bodies of the planets former inhabitants  has devoured them all and absorbed them  melting the remains into the form of an eternal  self rejuvenating  supracellular element  
in the white  earth like light of the fluorescent lamps  i removed the cameras l books that lay on the table and  spreading out a map of solaris on a plastic board  i gazed into it  leaning with my hands against the metal slats at the edges  the living ocean had its shallows and depths  and its islands  covered with a tarnish of weathering minerals  testified that they had once formed its bottom   did it also regulate the emergence and sinking of the rock formations submerged in its bosom  it was completely dark  i stared at the huge hemispheres on the map  painted in various tones of purple and blue  experiencing  i dont know for which time in my life  an astonishment as shocking as the first one  experienced when  as a boy  i learned at school about the existence of solaris 
i dont know how it happened that the surroundings  together with the mystery of gib rians death  that even my unknowable future seemed to me at once unimportant  and i thought of nothing  submerged in looking at this map  terrifying to every human being 
the different stretches of the vivarium were named after the explorers who had devoted themselves to their exploration  i was staring at the equatorial archipelagoes of the thexalla gliomasiv when i felt someones gaze on me 
i was still standing over the map  but i could no longer see it  i was as if paralysed  the door was in front of me  it was jammed with crates and a cupboard squatting against it  its some kind of automaton  i thought  although none had been in the room before  and it couldnt have entered without me noticing  the skin on the nape of my neck and back was beginning to burn  the feeling of a heavy  immobile gaze was becoming unbearable  i didnt realise that by pulling my head into my arms i was leaning harder and harder against the table  which began to glide slowly across the floor  this movement as if it had liberated me  i turned around abruptly 
the room was empty  in front of me  only the great semicircular window wafted black  the sensation did not subside  darkness stared back at me  amorphous  huge  eyeless  boundless  no star illuminated the darkness beyond the panes  i pulled back the light proof curtains  i hadnt even been on the station for an hour  and i was already beginning to understand why there were incidents of persecutory mania on it  i linked it reflexively to the death of gib rian  knowing him  i had hitherto thought that nothing could have disturbed his mind  i stopped being sure of that  i stood in the middle of the room next to the table  my breathing had calmed down  i could feel the sweat that had occurred on my forehead cooling down  what had i thought of just now  the truth   about the vending machines  the fact that i hadnt encountered any in the corridor or in the rooms was very strange  where had they all gone  the only one i encountered   remotely   belonged to a mechanical airport attendant  and the others 
i glanced at my watch  actually  i should have gone to   by now 
i went out  the corridor was lit rather dimly by fluorescent lights running from the ceiling  i passed two doors until i came to the one with  s name on it  i stood in front of them for a long time  silence filled the station  i took the handle  i didnt actually want to go in there at all  it bent  the door moved an inch away  a gap appeared  black for a moment  then the light came on  now anyone passing along the corridor could see me  i crossed the threshold quickly and closed the door behind me  noiselessly and firmly  then i turned around 
i stood with my back almost touching the door  it was a larger room than mine  also with a panoramic window  three quarters covered by a curtain of tiny blue and pink flowers  undoubtedly brought from earth and not part of the stations equipment  along the walls were library shelves and cabinets  both enamelled a very light green with a silvery sheen  their contents  dumped in whole piles on the floor  piled up between stools and armchairs  just in front of me  two step stools blocked the aisle  toppled and wedged partially into the piles of magazines that jutted from cracked folders  the open  page fanning books were drenched with liquids from broken flasks and flasks with lapped corks  most of them so thick walled that a mere fall to the floor  even from a considerable height  would have failed to shatter them  beneath the window lay an overturned desk with a broken work lamp on a cantilevered arm  a stool lay in front of it  its two legs caved in  half extended drawers  a veritable flood of cards  handwritten sheets  papers covered the entire floor  i recognised  s handwriting and leaned over them  picking up the loose sheets  i noticed that my hand was casting not a single shadow as before  but a double shadow 
i turned around  the pink curtain blazed as if lit at the top  a sharp line of violent blue fire that expanded with each passing moment  i jerked the fabric to the side   my eyes were gobsmacked by the shrill fire  it occupied a third of the horizon  a thicket of long  ghastly stretched shadows ran in dimpled waves towards the station  it was the east  in the zone where the station was located  the planets second blue sun was ascending into the sky after an hour long night  an automatic switch turned off the ceiling lights as i returned to the abandoned papers  i came across a succinct description of an experiment designed three weeks ago     intended to subject plasma to very hard x rays  i realised from the text that it was intended for    who was to organise the experiment   i held a copy in my hand  the white sheets of paper were beginning to glaring at me  the day that followed was different from the previous one  under the orange sky of the cooling sun  the ocean  inked with bloody reflections  was covered almost always with a dirty pink haze  melting into one the vault  the clouds  the waves   it was all gone now  even the light filtering through the pink fabric burned like the torch of a powerful quartz lamp  the tan of my hands became almost grey in it  the whole room changed  everything that had a tinge of red turned brown and faded to the colour of liver  while white  green and yellow objects sharpened in colour that they seemed to radiate their own glow  squinting  i looked through the crack of the curtain  the sky was a white sea of fire  beneath which vibrated and dangled as if liquid metal  i clenched my eyelids with red circles expanding in my field of vision  on the console of the washbasin  its rim was shattered  i discovered dark glasses  covering almost half my face  and put them on  the window curtain was now blazing like a sodium flame  i read on  picking up the sheets from the ground and placing them on the only table not overturned  parts of the text were missing  protocols of experiments already carried out were going  i learned from them that they had subjected the ocean to irradiation for four days at a point one thousand four hundred miles north east of its present location  all of this together surprised me because the use of x rays was forbidden by un convention because of their lethal effects  and i was quite sure that no one had approached earth to get permission for these experiments  at one point  raising my head  i saw my own reflection in the mirror of the ajar wardrobe door  a deathly white face with black glasses  incredibly the room looked  blazing white and blue  but after a few minutes a protracted rasping sound could be heard and airtight flaps slid shut on the windows from outside  the interior darkened and the artificial light came on  strangely pale now  it only got warmer and warmer until the steady tone emanating from the air conditioning ducts resembled a strained whine  the stations cooling apparatuses were working at full power 
nevertheless  the dead heat was still rising 
footsteps reached me  someone was walking down the corridor  with two noiseless steps i found myself at the door  the steps slowed down and died away  whoever was walking was standing behind the door  the handle bent slowly  without thinking  i reflexively grabbed it from my side and held it  the pressure did not intensify  but neither did it weaken  the person on the other side of the door acted just as silently  as if surprised  we held the handle for a good moment  then it sprang suddenly in my hand   it let go  and a faint rustling noise indicated that the other person was leaving  i stood still listening  but there was silence
