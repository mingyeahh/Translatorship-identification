i hastily folded in four and put  s notes in my pocket  i walked slowly over to the wardrobe and looked inside   overalls and clothes were crammed and stuffed into one corner  as if someone was standing there  a corner of an envelope was sticking out from under a pile of papers on the floor  i picked it up  it was addressed to me  with my throat suddenly clenched  i tore open the envelope and had to struggle to unfold the small sheet of paper stuck inside 
in his regular  remarkably fine but legible handwriting    noted 
ann  solar  vol  i  anex  also  vot  sepa rat  messenger in spr  f   ravintzers little apocrypha  that was all  not a single word more  the writing bore traces of haste  was it some important message  when had he written it  i thought i had to go to the library as soon as possible  i knew about this appendix to the first solary yearbook  that is  i knew of its existence  but i had never had it in my hand  as it represented purely historical value 
on the other hand  i had never even heard of any ra vintzer or his  little apocrypha  
what to do 
im already a quarter of an hour late  once again  from the doorway  i took in the whole room with my eyes  only now did i notice the folding bed fixed vertically to the wall  because it was obscured by an unrolled map of
solaris  behind the map something was hanging  it was a pocket tape recorder in a case  i took out the camera 
hung the case in its former place  and slipped the tape recorder into my pocket  i looked at the counter   almost the entire reel was recorded 
again i stood at the door for a second with my eyes closed  listening with effort to the silence outside  nothing  i opened the door  the corridor seemed a black pit  i took off my dark glasses only now and saw the faint ceiling lights  i closed the door behind me and walked to the left  towards the radio station 
i was approaching the circular chamber from which the corridors spread out in the shape of the spokes of a wheel  when  passing some narrow side passage leading  it seems  to the bathrooms  i saw a large  indistinct figure almost merging with the twilight 
i stopped as if caught off guard  from the depths of this offshoot walked an enormous black woman with an unhurried  duck like gait  i saw the flash of her whites and almost simultaneously heard the soft  barefoot patter of her feet  she wore nothing but a shiny yellowish skirt  as if made of straw  she had huge  sagging breasts  and her black arms rivalled the thighs of a normal man  she passed me without even looking in my direction   at a metres distance   and went  swinging her elephantine orbs  similar to those stone age steatopygic sculptures one sometimes sees in anthropological museums  where the corridor curved  she turned sideways and disappeared into the door of  s cabin  as she opened it  she stood for a blink in the stronger light that burned in the room  the door closed quietly and i was left alone  with my right hand i grasped the knuckle of my left and squeezed it with all my might until the bones crunched  i looked around unconsciously at my surroundings  what had happened  what was that  as suddenly as if someone had hit me  i remembered  s warning  what did that mean  who was this brooding aphrodite  where had she come from  i took one  just one step towards  s cabin and became immobile  i knew all too well that i would not go in there  i fished the air with dilated nostrils  something didnt feel right  something was wrong   ah  instinctively  i expected the foul  distinct stench of her sweat  but even as she passed me by with a step  i felt nothing  i dont know how long i stood leaning against the cool metal of the wall  silence filled the station  and the only sound i heard was the distant  monotonous sound of the air conditioning compressors 
i slapped my face lightly with my open hand and walked slowly to the radio station  as i pressed the door handle  i heard a sharp voice 
  whos there 
  it was me    
he was sitting at a table between a stack of aluminium boxes and the transmitter desk  eating meat concentrate straight from the can  i dont know why he had chosen the radio station as his home  i stood  stupefied  at the door  staring at his chewing jaws and suddenly i felt how hungry i was  i walked over to the shelves  selected the least dusty one from the stack of plates and sat down opposite him  we ate in silence for a while  then   stood up  took a thermos from the wall cupboard and poured us each a glass of hot broth  putting the thermos on the floor  there was no more room on the table  he asked 
  have you seen   
  no  where is he 
  upstairs 
upstairs was the laboratory  we ate on  silently  until the plate clattered in the emptied tin  night reigned in the radio station  the window was closed tight from the outside  four circular fluorescent lights were burning under the ceiling  their reflections vibrated in the plastic cover of the transmitter  the taut skin on  s cheekbones was marked with red veins  he was now wearing a black  loose  frayed jumper 
  is there something for you    he asked 
  no  what should i be 
  you were sweating 
i wiped my forehead with my hand  i was indeed dripping with sweat  it must have been a reaction after the previous shock  he looked at me investigatively  was i supposed to tell him  i preferred him to show me more confidence himself  who was playing against whom here and in what incomprehensible way 
  its hot   i said    i supposed the air conditioning was working better in your place 
  it will even out in about an hour  are you sure its just from the heat    he raised his eyes at me 
i chewed conscientiously  as if i hadnt seen it 
  what are you going to do    he finally asked when we had finished eating  he threw the whole dish and the empty cans into the washstand against the wall and returned to his chair 
  i will comply with you  i replied phlegmatically    do you have a research plan after all  some new stimulus  supposedly an x ray or something  no 
  x ray    he raised his eyebrows    where did you hear about that 
  i cant remember anymore  someone told me  maybe on prometheus  why  are you doing it already 
  i dont know the details  it was  s idea  he started it with    but how can you know about it  he shrugged his shoulders 
  you dont know the details  you should be there  after all it falls within your scope   i didnt finish  he was silent  the whining coming from the air conditioners had quietened down  and the temperature too was kept at a bearable level  all that hung in the air was a constant high pitched tone  like the buzzing of a dying fly    stood up  walked over to the control panel and began to flick contacts without any sense  as the main switch stood in the dead position  he fiddled like this for a while until  without turning his head  he noticed 
  the formalities will have to be completed in connection with this     you know 
  yes 
he turned and looked at me as if close to rage  i cant say that i was deliberately trying to get him off balance  but not understanding anything about the game that was going on here  i preferred to be restrained  a bony grin walked over his black jumper tube 
  youve been to    he said suddenly  it wasnt a question  i raised my eyebrows and looked him calmly in the face 
  you were in his room  he repeated  i made a small movement of my head  as if i were saying lets say  lets put it that way  i wanted him to go on talking 
  who was there    he asked 
he knew about her   
  nobody  and who could have been there    i asked 
  then why didnt you let me in  i smiled 
  because i was frightened  after your warning  when the handle moved  i held it reflexively  why didnt you say it was you  i would have let you in 
  i thought it was    he said uncertainly 
  so what of it 
  what do you think about     what happened there    he countered the question with a question  i hesitated 
  you must know better than me  where is he 
  in the cold room   he answered immediately    we moved him just this morning     because of the heat 
  where did you find it 
  in the wardrobe 
  in the wardrobe  was he dead 
  his heart was still beating  but he wasnt breathing  it was agony 
  did you try to save him 
  no 
  why  he hesitated 
  i didnt make it  he died before i put him down 
  was he standing in the wardrobe  between those overalls 
  yes 
he walked over to a small desk in the corner and brought a sheet lying on it  he laid it down in front of me    i wrote down a kind of makeshift protocol  he said    its even good for you to have a look around the room  cause of death    injection of a lethal dose of pernostal  here you have it written down   
i ran my eyes over the short text 
  suicide      i repeated quietly    and the cause    
  disorder    depression    or whatever you want to call it  you know better than i do 
  i only know what i see myself   i replied and looked down into his eyes  as he stood over me 
  what do you mean by that    he asked calmly 
  he injected himself with pernostal and hid in the wardrobe  yes  if that was the case  its not depression  not any kind of disorder  but acute psychosis  para noia    he probably thought he saw something       i spoke more and more slowly  looking into his eyes 
he walked away to the radio desk and started snapping contacts again 
  heres your signature  i spoke up after a moments silence    and   
  hes in the lab  ive already told you  he doesnt show up  i suppose    that what 
  that he has shut himself away 
  shut up  ah  he has shut up  please  maybe he barricaded himself in 
  maybe 
         i said   theres someone on the station 
  did you see 
he looked at me  bent over 
  you warned me  from whom  is this a hallucination 
  what did you see  
  its a man  huh 
he was silent  he turned towards the wall  as if he didnt want me to observe his face  he drummed his fingers on the metal partition  i looked at his hands  there was no longer a trace of blood on his knuckles  i experienced a brief  like a flash  daze 
  this person is real  i said quietly  almost in a whisper  as if  i was telling him a secret that could be overheard    what can be     can be touched  she can be    hurt    the last time you saw her was today 
  how do you know  
he didnt turn around  he was standing against the very wall  touching her breast  just as my words hit him 
  immediately before i landed     not long before    
he shrank back as if from a blow  i saw his crazed eyes 
  you       he mouthed   who are you    
he looked as if he wanted to pounce on me  this was not what i had expected  the situation came to a head  he didnt believe i was who i said i was  what was that supposed to mean  he looked at me with utmost horror  was it madness already  poisoning  anything was becoming possible  but i had seen it   this creature  and therefore myself      also    
  who was it    i asked  the words reassured him  for a moment he looked at me investigatively  as if he did not yet believe me  i already knew it was a false stroke and that he would not answer me before he even opened his mouth 
he sat down slowly in his chair and squeezed his head with his hands 
  whats going on here       he said quietly    maligna   
  who was it    i asked again 
  if you dont know      he muttered 
  then what 
  its nothing 
      i said   were far enough away from home  lets play o hole cards  its all convoluted anyway 
  what do you mean 
  to tell you who you saw 
  and you       he chuckled suspiciously 
  youre chasing a heel  ill tell you and youll tell me  rest assured  i wont take you for a madman  because i know    
  crazy  great god    tried to laugh    man  but youre nothing  absolutely nothing     but what a salvation that would be  if he had believed for a moment that it was madness  he wouldnt have done it  he would have lived    
  so what you wrote in the protocol about the disorder is a lie 
  of course 
  why dont you write the truth 
  why       he repeated 
silence fell  again i was in complete darkness  comprehending nothing  and for a moment i thought i could convince him and together we would attack the riddle  why  why did he not want to talk 
  where are the automatons    i spoke up 
  in the warehouses  we have closed all of them except for the airport staff 
  why 
again  he didnt answer 
  you wont say 
  i cant 
there was an element of it that i couldnt grasp  why not go upstairs to sarto rius 
at once i remembered the card and that seemed to be the most important thing at the moment 
  can you imagine continuing to work under these conditions    i asked  he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously 
  what does it matter 
  oh yeah  so what are you going to do  he remained silent  in the silence the distant sound of barefoot footsteps could be heard  in the midst of nickel and plastic apparatuses  tall cabinets of electron apparatus  glass  precision instruments  this clattering  sprawling gait sounded like a clownish trick of someone out of his mind  the stepping was getting closer  i stood up  watching   with the utmost tension  he was listening with his eyes squinted into slits  but did not seem frightened at all  so wasnt she the one he was afraid of 
  where did she come from    i asked  and when he hesitated    dont you want to say 
  i dont know 
  well 
the footsteps moved away and became quiet 
  dont you believe me    he said    i give you my word i dont know 
silently  i opened the wardrobe of suits and began to unzip their heavy  empty shells  as i expected  deep inside  on hooks  hung gas pistols  used to move in a gravityless vacuum  they werent worth much  but they represented some kind of weapon after all  i preferred one to none  i inspected the hold and slung the lash of the case over my shoulder    watched me closely  when i adjusted the length of the lash  he showed his yellow teeth in a mocking smile 
  happy hunting    he said 
  thank you for everything  i replied  walking to the door  he sprang up from his seat 
    
i looked at him  he was no longer smiling  i dont know if ive ever seen such a tormented face 
     its not    i    i really cant   he mumbled  i waited to see if he would say anything else  but he only moved his lips as if he wanted to get something out of them 
i turned around and left without another word
