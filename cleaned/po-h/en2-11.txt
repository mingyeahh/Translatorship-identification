    is it because of this experiment  
     i flinched at the sound of her voice  id been lying sleepless for
hours  staring into the darkness  alone  because i couldnt even hear
her breathing  and in the tangled labyrinth of nighttime thoughts that
were feverish  half logical  and thus acquired a new dimension and
meaning  id forgotten about her 
      what      how did you know i wasnt asleep         i asked  there
was fear in my voice 
      from the way youre breathing   she said quietly  as if apologet 
ically   i didnt mean to bother you      if you cant talk  dont   
  
      no  why not  yes  its the experiment  you guessed  
      what do they expect it to accomplish  
      they dont know themselves  something  anything  this isnt
operation thought  its operation despair  now they only need only
one thing  someone wholl have enough courage to make a decision 
but most people see that kind of courage as ordinary cowardice 
because its a retreat  you know  surrender  an escape thats unworthy
of a person  as if worthiness was plodding forward and getting bogged
down  and drowning in something you dont understand and never
will  
     i broke off  but before my quickened breathing calmed down i
gave vent to a new burst of anger 
     of course theres never any lack of guys with a practical outlook 
they said that even if contact isnt made  still  by studying the plasma
and all those crazy living cities that pop out of it for a single day then
disappear again  well learn the secrets of matter  as if they didnt know
theyre fooling themselves  theyre wandering around in a library of
books written in an unknown language  and just looking at the colors
of the spines      thats how it is  
     are there no other planets like this  
     no one knows  perhaps there are  but we only know this one 
in any case its something extremely rare  unlike earth  us  were
common  were the grass of the universe  and we take pride in our
commonness  that its so widespread  and we thought it could en 
compass everything  it was a kind of schema we took with us when
we set off intrepidly and joyfully on our long journey  other worlds 
but what exactly are they  those other worlds  wed conquer them or
wed be conquered  there was nothing else in those wretched brains
of ours  it wasnt worth it  it really wasnt  
    i got up  in the dark i found the first aid kit and a flat bottle of
sleeping pills 
     im going to get some sleep  darling   i said  turning towards the
darkness  from where there came the high pitched hum of the air
conditioning   i need to sleep  otherwise i really dont know      
    i sat back down on the bed  she touched my hand  i put my arms
around her  unseen  and held her without moving until my grip was
loosened by slumber 
    in the morning  when i woke fresh and rested  the experiment
seemed trivial to me  i couldnt understand how i could have attached
so much importance to it  i didnt care either that   had to go
to the lab with me  all her efforts became futile after id been gone
from the room for a few minutes  so i gave up any thoughts of further
attempts  even though she herself urged them  she was even prepared
to be locked up somewhere   i suggested she take a book to read 
    i was interested less in the procedure itself than in what id find
in the laboratory  aside from certain evident gaps in the bookcases
and the cabinets with chemical glassware  in addition to which  panes
were missing in the doors of several of the cabinets  while one of the
doors itself had a star shaped crack as if thered been a recent strug 
gle whose traces had been hurriedly though rather carefully covered
over   there was nothing out of the ordinary in that blue and white
room     who was bustling about among the equipment  behaved
entirely correctly  accepting the presence of   as something quite
ordinary  and bowing slightly to her from a distance  as he was moist 
ening my temples and forehead with conductive gel    came
in through a small door that led to the darkroom  he was wearing a
white lab coat  over which he had a black anti radiation apron that
reached down to his ankles  brisk and matter of fact  he greeted me
as if we were just two employees among a hundred at some big insti 
tute on earth and had seen each other just the previous day  it was
only now i noticed that the lifeless expression of his face came from
contact lenses  which he wore instead of eyeglasses 
     arms folded on his chest  he stood and watched as   wrapped
a bandage around the electrodes attached to my head  forming a kind
of white cap  several times he cast his eyes about the whole room 
seeming not to notice    who sat hunched and uncomfortable on
a small stool by the wall  pretending to read her book  when  
stepped away from my chair i moved my head  which was weighed
down with metal and wires  to watch him turn on the apparatus  but
all at once   raised his hand and said unctuously 
      doctor    id like to ask for a moment of your attention  i
dont wish to impose anything on you  for that would not serve our
purpose  but you need to stop thinking about yourself  about me 
about our colleague    about any other persons  so that by elim 
inating the randomness of particular individuals  you concentrate on
the matter at hand  earth and solaris  generations of researchers who
constitute a whole  despite the fact that particular people have their
beginnings and endings  our unyielding efforts at establishing intellec 
tual contact  the historical path taken by humanity  the certainty that
it will be continued into the future  the readiness to make any effort
and any sacrifice  to give up all personal feelings in the interests of
our mission these are the subjects that ought to fill your conscious 
ness completely  true  the sequence of associations does not depend
entirely on your will  but the fact that you are here at all guarantees
the authenticity of the continuity i speak of  if you are uncertain you
have performed the task appropriately please say so  and dr   
will repeat the recording  after all  we do not lack for time      
     he uttered these last words with a pale dry smile that did not
detract in the slightest from the expression of penetrating consterna 
tion in his eyes  i was writhing inside from this mountain of cliches
pronounced with such earnestness and gravity  fortunately   in 
terrupted the lengthening silence 
      shall we      he asked  leaning on the high console of the
electroencephalograph  in a casual  unconstrained pose  as if he were
resting his elbow on an armchair  i was grateful to him for using my
first name 
      yes   i said  half closing my eyes  the jitters that had laid waste
to my mind when he finished attaching the electrodes and placed his
fingers on the switch suddenly passed  through my eyelashes i could
see the pinkish glow of the control lights on the black dashboard of
the machine  the cold  disagreeable chill of the metal electrodes 
pressed to my head like frozen coins  also went away  i was like a
dark  unlit stage  the empty space was surrounded on all sides by
an invisible crowd of spectators gathered in a circle around a silence
filled with an ironic contempt for   and the mission  the
tension felt by these inner observers  eager to play an improvised role 
grew weaker       i thought the word as a test  with a sickening
unease  prepared to withdraw it immediately  but that blind  attentive
audience of mine did not protest  for a certain short time i was
nothing but pure tenderness  sincere regret  willing to undertake long 
patient sacrifices    filled me  lacking features  shape  face  and
at the same time  through the impersonal idea of her  infused with
desperate affection  i had a vision of giese  the father of solaristics
and of solaricists  in all the dignity of his professorial presence  but
i wasnt thinking about the muddy explosion  about the stinking void
that swallowed up his gold rimmed spectacles and his scrupulously
brushed gray mustache  i could only see the engraving on the title
page of his monograph  the densely hatched background the artist
had added around his head such that it appeared unsuspectingly
almost in an aureola  so similar not in its features but its steadfast
old fashioned prudence to the face of my own father  and in the end
i didnt know which of the two of them was looking at me  neither of
them had a grave  something that in our times was so frequent and
ordinary that it stirred no particular feelings 
    the image was fading already  and for a moment that lasted i dont
know how long i forgot about the station  the experiment     the
black ocean  everything  i was filled with an instantaneous certainty
that those two men  who were no longer with us  infinitely small and
turned to dust  had been equal to anything they had encountered  and
the calm that resulted from this realization annihilated the formless
crowd surrounding the arena in mute expectation of my defeat  along
with a double click of the apparatus being turned off  the artificial
light exploded into my eyes  i squinted    was gazing at me
inquiringly  still in the same pose     his back to the other man 
was busy with the equipment  seemingly deliberately clattering the
clogs he wore loosely on his feet 
     do you think it was successful  dr        asked  his
repulsive nasal voice breaking off 
     yes   i said 
     are you sure     responded with a hint of surprise or
even suspicion 
     yes  
    the certainty and brusqueness of my reply temporarily threw him
off balance with his stiff solemnity 
     oh      very well         he mumbled  and looked around as if he
didnt know what to do now    came up to my chair and started
unwinding the bandage 
    i got up and walked around the room  in the meantime   
who had disappeared into the darkroom  came out with the film
already developed and dried  the wavering lines with their whitish
zigzags covered several yards of tape  like some kind of mold or
cobweb extending along the shiny black ribbon of celluloid 
    i no longer had anything to do  but i didnt leave  the other two
men had entered the tape into the oxidized head of the modulator 
  had taken a last look at the end of it  frowning mistrustfully 
as if he were attempting to decipher what was contained in those
shaky lines 
     the rest of the experiment was not to be seen  i only knew what
was happening when they stood at the instrument consoles by the
wall and turned on the appropriate apparatus  the current sprang
to life with a faint bass hum in the coil casing beneath the armored
floor  and then there were just the lights in the vertical glass tubes of
the indicators moving downwards to show that the great tube of the
x ray cannon was dropping down the vertical shaft and coming to
rest in its open mouth  at this point the lights stopped at the lowest
levels of the scale and   began to crank up the voltage till the
indicators  or more accurately the white bars that represented them 
fluttered and made a half turn to the right  the noise of the current
was barely audible  nothing was happening  the drums containing
the film revolved beneath their cover so even that was out of sight 
and the footage counter ticked softly like the workings of a clock 
       gazed now at me  now at them  from over her book  i went
up to her  she gave me a quizzical look  the experiment was ending
now    slowly approached the conical top of the machine 
      can we go     mouthed at me  i nodded  she got up  with 
out saying goodbye to anyone i would have found it too ridiculous 
i walked past   
     the high windows of the upper corridor were filled with a sunset
of exceptional beauty  it wasnt the usual cheerless tumescent red  but
every possible shade of pink  beneath a luminous mist that seemed
sprinkled with the finest silver  the leaden  irregularly undulating
black of the oceans endless plain seemed to respond to this mild
aura with a spume that gave off a soft  dirty purple reflection  it was
only at its very zenith that the sky was fiercely ruddy 
     all at once i came to a halt in the middle of the downstairs
corridor  i couldnt bear to think that once again wed be stuck in our
cabin open to the ocean  like in a prison cell 
          i said   you know      i wouldnt mind swinging by the
library  would that be ok        
      sure  id be glad to  i could look for something to read   she said 
with somewhat artificial animation 
     i sensed that since the day before there was an unfilled gulf be 
tween us and that i ought to show her a least a little warmth  but
i was overcome by complete apathy  i dont know what would have
had to happen for me to be shaken out of it  we went back along
the corridor  then down a ramp to a small vestibule  here there were
three doors  and between them flowers as if in display cabinets behind
crystal glass panes 
     the middle door  which led to the library  was lined on both sides
with bulging artificial leather which i tried not to touch as i went in 
inside it was a little cooler in the large circular space under the pale
silver ceiling with its stylized suns 
     i ran my hand across the backs of the series of solaristic classics 
and i was about to take down the first volume of giese  the one with
the engraving under tissue paper on the title page  when i unexpect 
edly found gravinskys small format book  which id overlooked the
previous time 
     i sat down on an upholstered chair  it was completely quiet  a
few feet away from me   was flipping through some book  i
could hear the faint rustle of the pages beneath her fingers  gravin 
skys compendium  which was most often used in school as a simple
crib  was an alphabetically arranged collection of solaristic hypothe 
ses  from abiological to zoo degenerative  the compiler  who i dont
think had ever seen solaris  had plowed through every monograph 
expedition logbook  fragmentary text and interim report  hed even
found quotations in the works of planetologists who studied other
globes  and provided a catalogue that was somewhat terrifying in the
brevity of its formulations  since some of them veered into incon 
sequentiality  deprived of the subtle complexity of thought that had
accompanied their inception  though in fact the whole  encyclopedic
in intention  had ended up rather having curiosity value only  the
book had been published twenty years before  and in the meantime
a mountain of new hypotheses had appeared  by now too numerous
to be contained in a single volume  i looked over the alphabetical
index of authors  which was like a list of the fallen very few of
them were still alive  and i dont think a single one was still active
in the field  this entire treasury of thought  branching off in every
direction  left the impression that one of the hypotheses simply had
to be correct  that it wasnt possible reality should be entirely other
than the myriad propositions hurled at it  gravinsky had prefaced the
whole with an introduction in which he divided the preceding almost
sixty years of solaris studies into periods  in the first  dating from
the initial exploration of the planet  no one was really consciously
proposing hypotheses yet  at that time it was assumed  intuitively as
it were  on the basis of  common sense   that the ocean was a life 
less chemical conglomerate  a monstrous mass of jelly covering the
globe  which produced extraordinary formations as a consequence
of its  quasi volcanic  activity  and through self generating automatic
processes stabilized its irregular orbit  just as a pendulum maintains
an unchanging plane once set in motion  true  only three years
later magenon declared the living nature of the  gelatinous machine  
though gravinsky dated the period of biological hypotheses as begin 
ning only nine years afterwards  when magenons previously isolated
notion began to gather more and more supporters  the subsequent
years abounded in theoretical models of the living ocean  all highly
complex and based on biomathematical analyses  the third period
involved the collapse of what had hitherto been largely monolithic
opinion on the part of scholars 
    a multiplicity of schools appeared  that often fought furiously with
one another  it was the time when panmaller  strobla  freyhouss  le
greuill  and osipovich were active  gieses entire legacy was subject
to devastating critique  it was at that time there appeared the first
atlases  catalogues  stereoscopic photographs of asymmetriads  which
previously had been regarded as unexaminable the turning point
came with new remote controlled mechanisms that were dispatched
into the stormy hearts of the giants  which threatened to explode at
any moment  at this point  in the margins of the raging discussions 
there began to appear isolated  scornfully ignored minimalistic hy 
potheses suggesting that even if the much trumpeted  contact  with
a  rational monster  were not made  an examination of the harden 
ing mimoid cities and balloon like mountains thrown up and subse 
quently swallowed by the ocean was still likely to produce valuable
chemical and physio chemical knowledge and insights into the struc 
ture of giant molecules  but no one even engaged the proponents of
such ideas in debate  after all  it was a period that saw the appear 
ance of still current catalogues of typical metamorphoses  or francks
bioplasmic theory of mimoids  which  though it was abandoned as
false  remained a magnificent example of intellectual panache and
logical construction 
    these  gravinsky periods   which lasted over thirty years in all 
were the naive youth  the impulsively optimistic romanticism  and fi 
nally the maturity of solaristics  marked by the first skeptical voices 
by the end of the first twenty five years there were already heard as
a return to the first colloidal mechanistic theories hypotheses that
were their late offspring  concerning the non mental state of solaris
ocean  the entire search for signs of a conscious will  for a teleol 
ogy of processes  for activity motivated by the oceans inner needs 
was almost universally acknowledged to have been an aberration on
the part of a whole generation of researchers  a journalistic pas 
sion for refuting their assertions prepared the ground for the sober 
analytically oriented work  concentrating on the assiduous gathering
of facts  that was conducted by the group of holden  eonides  and
stoliwa  it was a time of the rapid increase in number and size of
archives and microfilm collections  of expeditions lavishly equipped
with every possible device earth had to offer  automatic recording
equipment  sensors  probes  you name it  in some years more than a
thousand people took part in the research at the same time  but while
the speed at which new material was amassed continued to grow  the
spirit that moved the scientists was waning  and there began a period
of decline  hard to pinpoint in time  for that still optimistic phase in
the exploration of solaris 
    it was characterized above all by the great and courageous personalities 
sometimes in theoretical imagination  sometimes in negation of peo 
ple such as giese  strobla  or sevada  the last of these  who was also
the last of the great solaricists  perished in mysterious circumstances
in the vicinity of the planets south pole  having done something that
even first timers never would  before the eyes of a hundred observers
he flew his machine  which had been gliding low over the ocean  into
the heart of a rapido which was clearly moving out of his way  there
was talk of some kind of sudden incapacity  a loss of consciousness 
or a rudder defect  in reality  i believe it was the first suicide the
first abrupt  overt explosion of despair 
     but not the last  gravinskys volume  however  did not include
such information  i added dates  facts  and details from myself as i
studied the yellowed pages and tiny print of his book 
     in fact  those sorry attempts on ones own life also came to a stop 
nor were there any more of the great characters  the recruitment
of scientists who are to devote themselves to a particular branch of
planetology is itself an unstudied phenomenon  people of outstanding
abilities and strength of character are born at more or less regular
intervals  so its only the matter of their selection that is uneven  their
presence or absence in a particular field of inquiry can perhaps be
explained by the perspectives it opens up  whatever one thinks about
the classic scholars of solaristics  no one can deny them greatness 
often genius  the best mathematicians and physicists  the leading
figures in biophysics  information theory  and electrophysiology  for
decades were drawn to the silent giant of solaris  all at once  from
one year to the next the army of researchers was  as it were  deprived
of its generals  there remained a gray  nameless mass of patient fact 
gatherers  compilers  creators of experiments that were occasionally
designed with originality  but there were no more mass expeditions
on a global scale  or bold unifying theories 
     solaristics seemed to be falling apart  and as a kind of accom 
paniment or parallel to its descent there was a flurry of hypotheses 
barely distinguishable from one another by second order details  re 
volving around the degeneration  retardation  involution of the seas of
solaris  from time to time more daring and intriguing conceptualiza 
tions emerged  but they all seemed to pass judgment on the ocean 
which came to be seen as the final stage of a development which long
ago  thousands of years back  had had its period of supreme organi 
zation and now  having survived only physically  was disintegrating
into a multitude of unnecessary  nonsensical agonal formations  so
these were monumental  centuries long death throes that was how
solaris was perceived  its extensors and mimoids were seen as tu 
morous growths  the processes that moved its huge fluid body were
examined for indications of chaos and anarchy  to the point that this
orientation became an obsession  and the entire scientific literature
of the following seven or eight years  though of course free of ex 
pressions explicitly indicating the feelings of its authors  nevertheless
was like one long barrage of insults revenge taken by the gray lead 
erless masses of solaricists upon the unchangingly indifferent object
of their intensified research  which continued to pay no attention to
them whatsoever 
     i was familiar with the work of a number of european psychol 
ogists wrongly  i think  excluded from this collection of classic so 
lariana  whose only connection with the field was that for a lengthy
period they researched public opinion  collecting the most ordinary
views  the attitudes of non specialists  and in this way demonstrated
the astonishingly close relationship between changes in such views
and processes simultaneously taking place among the ranks of schol 
ars 
     changes also occurred within the coordinating group of the plan 
etology institute  where decisions were made concerning the material
support provided for research  these changes resulted in a grad 
ual but prolonged reduction in the budget of solaristic institutes and
centers  and in grants for teams traveling to the planet 
     voices arguing for cutbacks in research mingled with speeches de 
manding more vigorous means  though no one may have gone further
than the administrative director of the worldwide cosmology insti 
tute  who stubbornly maintained that the living ocean wasnt ignoring
human beings  but rather it simply didnt notice them  just as an ele 
phant fails to see the ants crawling across its back  in order to call its
attention to ourselves  then  what was needed were powerful stimuli
and gigantic machines operating at the level of the entire planet  one
amusing detail was the fact that  as the press mischievously pointed
out  such costly measures were being demanded by the director of the
cosmology institute  not the institute of planetology  which financed
the exploration of solaris  this  then  was generosity with someone
elses money 
     subsequently  the confusion of hypotheses  the reviving of old
ones  the introduction of trivial changes rendering them more precise
or  on the contrary  more ambiguous all this began to turn the field
of solaristics  which despite its breadth had been rather straightfor 
ward up to this point  into an ever more entangled labyrinth full of
blind alleys  in an atmosphere of general indifference  stagnation  and
discouragement  a second ocean of futile print seemed in time to be
accompanying the ocean of solaris 
     about two years before i joined  s workshop as a graduate
of the institute  the mett irving foundation was founded  it offered
large prizes to anyone who found a way to utilize the energy of the
oceanic plasma to the benefit of human beings  this had already been
a temptation earlier  and spaceships had brought numerous consign 
ments of plasma to earth  long and patient work had been carried
out to find methods to conserve it  applying both high and low tem 
peratures  an artificial micro atmosphere and micro climate resem 
bling that of solaris  preservative radiation  and a thousand chemical
recipes  all of which merely allowed us to observe a more or less slug 
gish process of decay which  it goes without saying  like everything
else was described multiple times in extreme detail in all its stages 
autolysis  maceration  primary or early liquefaction  secondary or late
liquefaction  a similar fate befell samples taken from the various
productions and formations of the plasma  they differed from one
another only in the path they took to the end  which constituted a
watery fluid attenuated by auto fermentation  light as ash and gleam 
ing like metal  its composition  proportion of elements  and chemical
formulas could be given by any solaricist at the drop of a hat 
     the absolute failure to keep any large or small portion of the mon 
ster alive  or at least in a state of suspended vegetation or hibernation 
away from its planetary organism  became the source of a belief  de 
veloped by the school of meunier and prorokh  that there was in fact
only one single mystery to solve  and that once we opened it with the
right interpretive key  everything would immediately be clear     
     in the search for this key  this philosophers stone of solaris  time
and energy were expended by people who often had nothing to do
with science  and in solaristics fourth decade the numbers of mania 
cal impostors from outside the scientific community  zealots whose fa 
naticism exceeded that of their distant predecessors  like the prophets
of the  perpetuum mobile  or the  squaring of the circle  their num 
bers  then  assumed the dimensions of an epidemic  actually alarming
many psychologists  after a few years  however  this passion died
down  and when i was preparing for my voyage to solaris  both it and
the ocean that had inspired it had long disappeared from newspaper
headlines and from daily conversation 
     as i replaced gravinskys volume on the shelf  next to it since the
books were arranged alphabetically i noticed  barely visible between
the thick tomes  a small pamphlet by grattenstrom  one of the most
curious blooms of the solaristic literature  it was a work that  in the
struggle to understand the non human  was directed against humans
themselves  against people  a kind of lampoon of our species  furious
in its mathematical coldness  it was written by a self taught scholar
who had first published a series of outstanding contributions to cer 
tain highly specific and rather marginal branches of quantum physics 
in his most important and most extraordinary work  a mere dozen or
so pages long  he sought to demonstrate that even the most seem 
ingly abstract  sublimely theoretical  mathematicized achievements of
science have in reality moved only a step or two away from a prehis 
toric  coarsely sensory based  anthropomorphic understanding of the
world around us  grattenstrom examined the formulas of relativity
theory and of the theorem of force fields  he looked at parastatics and
the hypotheses of a unified cosmic field  in search of traces of the
human body   all that comes from and is a consequence of the exis 
tence of our senses  the structure of our organism  and the limitations
and weaknesses of humankinds animal physiology  he reached the
conclusion that there cannot now  nor in the future could there ever
be  talk of  contact  between human beings and any non humanoid
civilization  in this satire against the entire species the thinking ocean
is not mentioned once  but its presence  in the shape of a contemp 
tuously triumphal silence  could be sensed underlying virtually every
sentence  that was at any rate the impression i had had when i read
grattenstroms pamphlet for the first time  this work was actually
more of a curio than a work of solaristics in the strict sense of the
term  it was included in the library of classics of the genre because
it had been placed there by   himself who  as it happened 
had been the one who gave it me to read 
    with a strange feeling akin to respect i slipped the slim unbound
offprint back among the books on the shelf  i ran my fingertips
over the green and brown almanac of solaristics  amid all the chaos
and helplessness we were embroiled in  it couldnt be denied that
the experiences of the last few weeks had given us some certainty
on a couple of fundamental questions over which a sea of ink had
been spilled in recent years debates that previously had been futile
because they were unresolvable 
    someone fond of paradoxes and sufficiently stubborn could go on
doubting that the ocean was a living being  but it was impossible to
deny the existence of its mind  whatever could be understood by the
term  it had become quite clear that it was only too aware of our
presence above it      that statement alone disconfirmed the entire
expansive wing of solaristics that declared the ocean to be  a world
unto itself    a being unto itself   deprived by a process of repeated
atrophy of its former sensory organs  such that it supposedly knew
nothing of the existence of external phenomena or objects  enclosed
in a vortex of gigantic currents of thought whose abode  cradle  and
creator were the depths spinning beneath their two suns 
    and more  we had learned it could synthesize artificially that
which we ourselves could not our bodies and even improve them
by introducing into their subatomic structure inconceivable changes
which probably had something to do with the purposes that drove it 
    it existed then  it lived  thought  acted  the possibility of reducing
the  solaris problem  to nonsense or to zero  the belief that we were
not dealing with any being  and by the same token that our loss was
not in fact any kind of loss all this was gone for good  whether
they liked it or not  human beings had to take cognizance of a neigh 
bor that  though it was billions of miles away across the void and
separated from us by entire light years  still lay in the path of their
expansion  and was harder to grasp than the whole of the rest of the
universe 
    we may be at the turning point of all history  i thought to myself 
a decision to give up  turn back  either now or in the near future 
could prevail  i no longer regarded even the closing down of the
station as improbable  or at least beyond the bounds of possibility 
but i didnt believe that anything could be saved in this way  the
very existence of the thinking colossus would never let people abide
in peace again  however much they traveled across the galaxy and
made contact with civilizations of other beings similar to us  solaris
would present a perpetual challenge to humankind 
     one other small leather bound volume had found its way among
the yearbooks of the almanac  i gazed for a moment at the cover 
darkened from the touch of fingers  before i opened it  it was an old
book  the introduction to solaristics by muntius  i was remembering
the night i spent poring over it  and  s smile when he gave
me his copy  and the terrestrial dawn in the window as i reached
the words  the end   solaristics  wrote muntius  is a substitute for
religion in the space age  it is faith wrapped in the cloak of science 
contact  the goal for which we are striving  is as vague and obscure as
communion with the saints or the coming of the messiah  exploration
is a liturgy couched in methodological formulas  the humble work of
researchers is the expectation of consummation  of annunciation  for
there are not nor can there be any bridges between solaris and earth 
this obvious fact  like many others the absence of shared experi 
ences  the absence of conveyable concepts was rejected by solari 
cists  the same way the faithful reject arguments that would subvert
the underpinnings of their faith  besides  what do people expect 
what can they want from  informational communication  with think 
ing seas  a recording of experiences of a being that endures through
time  and is so old it probably cannot remember its own beginning 
a description of the desires  passions  hopes and sufferings  that are
released in the instantaneous birth of living mountains  the transfor 
mation of mathematics into existence  of loneliness and resignation
into plenitude  yet all this constitutes uncommunicable knowledge 
and if one attempts to translate it into any terrestrial language  all
those sought after values and significations are lost  they remain on
the far side  besides  it isnt these sorts of revelations  more worthy
of poetry than science  that are hoped for by the  believers   oh no 
though they themselves are unaware of it  what they are waiting for is
a revelation that would explain to them the meaning of humankind
itself  solaristics  then  is the posthumous child of long dead myths 
the final flower of mystical yearnings that people no longer have the
courage to utter aloud  while the cornerstone hidden deep in the
foundations of this edifice is the hope of redemption     
     but  incapable of admitting that this is truly the case  solaricists
scrupulously avoid all commentary on contact  such that in their
writings it becomes something ultimate and while in its initial  still
sober sense it was supposed to be a beginning  an introduction  an
entry point onto a new path  one of many  it became beatified  and
after the passage of years it turned into their eternity and their heaven 
   
     straightforward and bitter is the analysis offered by muntius  that
 heretic  of planetology  dazzling in its negation  in shattering the
myth of solaris  or rather of the human mission  that first voice 
which dared to speak out as solaristics was still a developing field
imbued with confidence and romanticism  was greeted with complete
disregard and silence something only too understandable  since ac 
cepting muntiuss words would have been tantamount to erasing so 
laristics completely as it had existed thus far  the beginnings of a dif 
ferent  dispassionate  modest solaristics waited in vain for a founder 
five years after muntius died  by which time his book had become
a bibliographic rarity  a collectors item not be found either in any
solaristic series or in philosophy libraries  a school named after him
arose a norwegian circle in which the composure of his exposition 
divided among the different characters of the thinkers assuming his
legacy  turned into the caustic  pigheaded sarcasm of erle ennesson 
and in a somewhat trivialized version  the  utilitarian  solaristics of
phaelanga  the latter called for a focus on the concrete benefits to be
gained from research  without becoming distracted by the daydreams
and false hopes of civilizational contact and intellectual communion
between two civilizations  yet next to muntiuss pitiless analysis  the
writings of all his intellectual disciples are little more than footnotery 
if not garden variety popularization  with the exception of the works
of ennesson and possibly takata  muntius himself had essentially ac 
complished everything  labeling the first phase of solaristics the  pe 
riod of the prophets   among whom he included giese  holden  and
sevada  the second phase he called  the great schism  the splitting
of the one solarian church into a clutch of warring denominations 
and he predicted a third phase one of dogmatism and scholastic fos 
silization which would set in when everything there was to research
had already been researched  this  however  did not happen  i be 
lieve   was correct after all in seeing muntiuss scorched earth
exposition as a massive over simplification that disregarded anything
in solaristics that ran contrary to the elements of faith  for in reality
what predominated in the field was unceasingly mundane research
that promised nothing beyond a material globe orbiting around two
suns 
     inside muntiuss book there was a faded offprint from the jour 
nal parerga solariana  folded in two  it was one of the first papers
  had written  before he became director of the institute  after
the title  why i am a solaricist  there followed a list  concise as a
precis almost  of the specific phenomena that justified the real possi 
bility of contact  for   belonged to what may well have been
the last generation of researchers who had the courage to refer back
to the glory days of optimism and were not averse to their own kind
of faith  which went beyond the boundaries laid down by science  yet
was eminently material  since it believed their efforts would succeed
so long as those efforts were sufficiently persistent and unceasing 
     he was trained in the well known  classic bioelectronic line of
research of the eurasian school  which included cho en min  ngyalla 
and kavakadze  this work had demonstrated similarities between im 
ages of the electrical functioning of the brain and certain discharges
that occurred within the plasma preceding the appearance of some
of its formations  including early stage polymorpha and geminate so 
larids  he rejected overly anthropomorphic interpretations  all those
mystical notions of the psychoanalytic  psychiatric  and neurophysi 
ological schools  which sought to attribute to the neurogliac ocean
particular human ailments such as epilepsy  the analogue of which
were supposedly the convulsive eruptions of asymmetriads   because
among the advocates of contact he was one of the most cautious
and clear headed  and could not abide anything so much as the sen 
sationalism which  admittedly very infrequently  accompanied one or
another discovery  as it happened  a wave of exactly this kind of
cheap interest was provoked by my doctoral dissertation  that was
here too  though of course not in printed form it was buried in one
of the microfilm capsules  in it  taking as my starting point the in 
novative research of bergmann and reynolds  who from the mosaic
of cortical processes had succeeded in identifying and  filtering out 
the components accompanying the most powerful emotions despair 
pain  joy i went on to juxtapose those recordings with discharges
emitted by currents in the ocean  and discovered oscillations and pat 
terns in the curves  in certain parts of the symmetriads canopy  at the
base of immature mimoids  and elsewhere  that offered a noteworthy
analogy  this was enough for my name to appear soon afterwards in
the gutter press beneath ludicrous headlines along the lines of  de 
spair of the jelly  or  planetary orgasm   but this worked out to my
advantage  or so i thought till recently   since i came to the attention
of   who  like any other solaricist  did not read every one of
the thousands of papers being published  especially those written by
novices  he wrote me a letter  that letter closed one chapter of my
life  and opened up a new one
