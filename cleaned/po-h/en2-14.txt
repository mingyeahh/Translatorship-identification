i was sitting by the big window and staring at the ocean  i had
nothing to do  the report  which had taken five days to write  was
now a bundle of waves speeding across the void somewhere beyond
the constellation of orion  when it reached the dark dusty nebula
that extends across eight trillion cubic miles and swallows every signal
and light ray  it would hit the first of a series of relays  from there 
from one radio beacon to the next  in leaps of billions of miles it
would hurtle in a vast arc all the way to the last relay  a metal
container packed tight with precision instruments and equipped with
the extended muzzle of a directional antenna  which would compress
it one more time and fling it further into space  toward earth  months
would pass and an identical packet of energy  trailing a wake of
shockwave distortions through the gravitational field of the galaxy 
would be shot from earth  would reach the edge of the cosmic cloud 
squeeze through it  fortified by the series of slowly drifting beacons 
and with undiminished rapidity would speed on toward the double
suns of solaris 
     beneath the red sun the ocean was blacker than ever  a ruddy
mist melted the place where it met the sky  the day was exceptionally
hot  as if presaging one of those extremely rare and unimaginably
violent storms that strike the planet a few times a year  there are
reasons to believe that its only inhabitant controls the climate and
itself causes the storms 
     for several more months i would be gazing from those windows 
observing from high up the sunrises of white gold and oppressive
red  mirrored from time to time in some fluid eruption  in the sil 
very bauble of a symmetriad  following the journey made by slender
rapidos leaning into the wind  encountering half degraded  crumbling
mimoids  one day the screens of all the visuphones would start to
flicker  the entire electronic signalization system  long dormant  would
spring to life  set in motion by an impulse sent from hundreds of
thousands of miles away announcing the approach of a metal colos 
sus that would lower itself over the ocean with a prolonged thunder
of its gravitors  it would be either the ulysses or the prometheus  or
another of the great long distance cruisers  when i climbed the ac 
commodation ladder from the flat roof of the station  on board id see
ranks of bulky white armored automats that do not share mankinds
original sin and are so innocent they carry out any command  to the
point of destroying themselves or any object lying in their path  if
their memory  oscillating in crystal  is so programmed  and then the
ship would move off  noiselessly  faster than sound  leaving behind it
a cone of reverberations splitting into bass octaves as it reached the
ocean  and the faces of all the humans would brighten for a moment
at the thought that they were returning home 
     but i had no home  earth  i thought about its great crowded
buzzing cities  in which i would become lost  almost effaced  as if id
gone through with what i wanted to do that second or third night 
thrown myself into the ocean where it rocked sluggishly in the dark 
ness  id drown in people  id be a reticent  observant  and therefore
valued  companion  id have many acquaintances  friends even  and
women  maybe even one woman  for some time id have to force
myself to smile  say hello  get to my feet  perform a thousand trivial
actions from which life on earth is composed  till i stopped being
aware of them  id find new interests  new pastimes  but i wouldnt
give myself over to them completely  not to anything or anyone  ever
again  and  maybe  id stare into the night towards the place where
the darkness of the dusty nebula blocks the light of two suns like a
black veil  id remember everything  even what i was thinking now 
and with an indulgent smile in which there was a hint of regret  but
also of superiority  id recall my follies and my hopes  i absolutely did
not regard that  me  of the future as anything worse than the  
who was prepared to do anything in the cause of so called contact 
and no one would ever have the right to judge me 
      came into the cabin  he looked around  then stared at me 
i got up and went up to the table 
     did you want something  
     am i right in thinking you dont have anything to do         he
asked  blinking   i could give you  there are some calculations that
need running  not that theyre urgent or anything      
     thanks   i said with a smile   but thats not necessary  
     are you sure   he asked  looking out of the window 
     yes  ive been thinking about various things and  
     id rather you didnt think so much  
     then you have no idea what this is about  tell me  do you     
believe in god  
    he gave me a sharp look 
     come off it  who still believes these days      
    unease flickered in his eyes 
     its not so straightforward   i said in a deliberately light tone   i
dont mean the traditional god of terrestrial beliefs  im no specialist
in religion  and i may not have come up with anything new  but do
you happen to know if there ever existed a faith in      a defective
god  
     defective   he repeated  raising his eyebrows   how do you
mean  in a certain sense the god of every religion was defective 
because he was encumbered with human qualities  only magnified 
the god of the old testament  for instance  was a hothead who
craved servility and was jealous of other gods      the greek gods had
just as many human imperfections  with their quarrelsomeness and
their family squabbles  
     no   i interrupted him   i mean a god whose deficiencies dont
arise from the simplemindedness of his human creators  but constitute
his most essential  immanent character  this would be a god limited
in his omniscience and omnipotence  one who can make mistakes in
foreseeing the future of his works  who can find himself horrified by
the course of events he has set in motion  this is      a cripple god 
who always desires more than hes able to have  and doesnt always
realize this to begin with  who has built clocks  but not the time that
they measure  has built systems or mechanisms that serve particular
purposes  but they too have outgrown these purposes and betrayed
them  and has created an infinity that  from being the measure of
the power he was supposed to have  turned into the measure of his
boundless failure  
     once there was manicheism     began hesitantly  the guarded
reserve with which hed been treating me in recent days had disap 
peared 
     but this has nothing to do with good and evil   i interrupted him
at once   this god doesnt exist outside of matter  hes unable to free
himself of it  and thats all he wants      
     i dont know any religion like that   he said after a moment of
silence   such a religion was never      necessary  if i understand you
correctly  and im afraid i do  then youre thinking about an evolv 
ing god who develops through time and grows  mounting higher and
higher levels of power toward the awareness of that powers impo 
tence  this god of yours is a being who has entered godhood like
entering a blind alley  and when he comprehends this  he yields to
despair  fine  but surely a despairing god is a human being  my
friend  youre thinking about human beings      this isnt just poor
philosophy  its even poor mysticism  
     no   i insisted   im not thinking about human beings  perhaps
in certain features that might match the provisional definition  but
only because its full of holes  a human being  appearances to the
contrary  doesnt create his own purposes  these are imposed by the
time hes born into  he may serve them  he may rebel against them 
but the object of his service or rebellion comes from the outside  to
experience complete freedom in seeking his purposes he would have
to be alone  and thats impossible  since a person who isnt brought
up among people cannot become a person  my      one has to be a
being devoid of plurality  you follow  
     oh   he said   right away i shouldve      
    and he pointed out the window 
      no   i disagreed   not that either  at the most as something that
in its growth missed an opportunity for godhood  having retreated too
soon into itself  its more of an anchorite  the hermit of the universe 
not its god      it repeats itself     whereas the one im thinking
about would never do that  maybe hes coming into existence as we
speak  in some corner of the galaxy  and before long  in a fit of
youthful intoxication hell start extinguishing some stars and lighting
others  after a certain time well notice it      
      we already have   said   sourly    novas and supernovas     
are they candles on his altar  according to you  
      if you want to treat what im saying so literally      
      perhaps solaris is precisely the cradle of this divine infant of
yours   added    an ever more distinct smile was ringing his eyes
with little creases   perhaps in your conception this is the origin  the
seed of the god of despair  perhaps its exuberant childhood is way
beyond our comprehension  and everything our libraries of solariana
contain is merely a catalogue of his infant reflexes      
      and for a while we were his playthings   i finished   yes  thats
possible  you know what we just managed to do  create an entirely
new hypothesis on the subject of solaris  and thats no small achieve 
ment  right away you have an explanation of the failure to make
contact  the lack of response  certain  lets say  extravagances in its
treatment of us  the mind of a small child      
      i dont need to put my name to it   he murmured as he stood by
the window  for a long moment we gazed at the black waves  on the
eastern horizon a pale elongated smudge could be seen through the
mist 
      where did you get that idea of a defective god   he asked
suddenly  not taking his eyes off the emptiness bathed in light 
      i dont know  it seemed to me very  very authentic  you know  it
would be the only god id be inclined to believe in  one whose suffer 
ing wasnt redemption  didnt save anyone  didnt serve any purpose 
it just was  
      a mimoid     said ever so quietly  in a different voice 
      what was that  oh  right  i noticed it before  its really old  
     we both gazed at the misty red horizon 
       im going to go fly there   i said unexpectedly   all the more
because ive been on the station the whole time  this is a good op 
portunity  ill be back in half an hour      
       what did you say     opened his eyes wide   youre going
out there  where to  
       there   i pointed at the indistinct flesh colored shape looming in
the mist   what harm could it do  ill take the small helicopter  itd
be ridiculous if  one day on earth  i had to admit that im a solaricist
whos never set foot on the planet      
      i went up to the locker and started picking out a set of overalls 
  watched me in silence then eventually said 
       i dont like this  
       what   i turned around with the overalls in my hand  i was
overcome by an excitement i hadnt experienced in a long while 
 whats the problem  come on  cards on the table  youre afraid that
ill      thats absurd  i give you my word i wouldnt  it hadnt even
occurred to me  no  really no  
       ill go with you  
       thanks  but id rather be on my own  after all  its something
new  something completely new   i was speaking quickly as i pulled
on the overalls    went on talking but i didnt really listen as i
hunted for what id need 
      he went with me to the docking bay  he helped me wheel out
the helicopter from its hangar into the middle of the launch pad  as
i was putting on my space suit he suddenly asked 
       does a mans word still carry any value with you  
       for gods sake     are you still on about that  it does  i
already gave you it  where are the backup canisters  
      he didnt say any more  when id closed the transparent cockpit
cover i signaled to him  he turned on the lift and i slowly rose to the
roof of the station  the engine sprang to life with a lengthy growl 
the three bladed rotor started spinning and the craft rose up  oddly
light  leaving behind it the ever shrinking silver disk of the station 
      it was my first time alone over the ocean  the effect was com 
pletely different than what one experiences watching through the win 
dows  this may also have been because of the low altitude i had
dropped to less than three hundred feet above the surface  it was only
now that i not only knew but actually felt how the alternating crests
and troughs of the vast expanse  with their oily glister  moved not like
a marine tide or a cloud  but like an animal  constant though ex 
tremely slow contractions of a muscular naked torso that was what
it looked like  the top of each wave flamed with red foam as it turned
over lazily  when i altered course to head directly toward the slowly
drifting island of the mimoid  the sun hit me in the eyes  there was a
flicker of bloody lightning in the convex windshield  while the ocean
itself turned inky blue with spots of dark fire 
     the arc that i described somewhat unskillfully brought me far
to windward  the mimoid left behind as a broad bright patch whose
irregular outline stood out against the ocean  it had lost the pink hue
the mist had given it  it was yellow as dry bone  for a moment i lost
sight of it  and instead i caught a glimpse of the station in the distance
where it seemed to hang suspended right over the ocean like a huge
zeppelin from the old days  i repeated the maneuver  concentrating
intently  the solid mass of the mimoid with its grotesque vertiginous
shape hove into view  i suddenly worried that id clip the topmost
of its bulbous ledges  and i brought the helicopter up so abruptly
that it juddered as it lost speed  my caution was unnecessary  as
the rounded summits of the bizarre towers sailed by far below me 
i guided the craft alongside the drifting island and slowly  foot by
foot  i began to reduce altitude till the crumbling peaks rose above
the cockpit  it wasnt big  from one end to the other it measured
perhaps three quarters of a mile  and no more than a few hundred
yards across  there were some narrower places where it was likely
to break up before long  it must have been a fragment from an
incomparably larger formation  by solaris standards it was a mere
splinter  a remnant  god knows how many weeks or months old 
     in amongst the stringy protuberances  right next to the ocean i
discovered a sort of shore  a few dozen square yards of rather steep
but smooth surface  and i directed the helicopter there  landing
proved harder than id thought  i came very close to catching the
rotor on a wall that suddenly rose up before my eyes  but i nailed
it  i turned the engine off at once and flipped up the cockpit cover 
standing on the wing  i made sure the helicopter wasnt in danger
of slipping into the ocean  the waves were licking at the jagged edge
only a dozen or so yards from where id touched down  but the
craft stood firmly on its broad landing skids  i jumped onto the 
     earth   what id taken before for a wall  the thing i almost
crashed into  was a huge osseous sheet  thin as a membrane and
honeycombed with holes  that stood vertical and was covered with
swellings that resembled balustrades  a gap several yards wide cut
across this whole multi story surface diagonally and  like the large
and irregularly placed holes  showed what lay beyond  i climbed up
the incline of the closest span of the wall  discovering that the boots
of the space suit had an excellent grip  while the suit itself did not
hinder my movements  finding myself four stories above the ocean  i
turned to face the interior of the skeletal landscape  it was only now
that i could get a proper look at it 
     the similarity to an ancient city half in ruins  to an exotic mo 
roccan settlement from centuries ago that had been brought down by
earthquake or other natural disaster  was astounding  i could see with
the greatest clarity the twisting labyrinth of streets partially blocked
by rubble  their steep winding descent toward a shore washed by
clammy foam  higher up  the still intact battlements and bastions 
their rounded foundations  and  in the bulging or concave walls  the
dark openings like broken windows or defensive slits  the whole
island city  leaning heavily to one side like a sunken galleon  pro 
ceeded in senseless motion  turning very slowly  as could be seen
from the apparent movement of the sun in the sky  which produced
a lazy play of shadow across the inner reaches of the ruins  at times
a ray of sunlight would slip through to reach the spot where i was
standing  i climbed higher still  at considerable risk  till a fine powder
began to crumble from the excrescences protruding over my head  as
it floated down it filled the crooked gullies and alleyways with great
billows of dust  a mimoid is of course not actual rock  and its resem 
blance to limestone ends when you take a piece in your hand its a
lot lighter than pumice  small celled  and hence extraordinarily airy 
     i was so high up now i could feel its movement  it wasnt just
floating forward  driven by the blows of the oceans black muscles 
who knows where from or where to  but it was also tilting first one
way then the other  exceptionally slowly  each of these pendulum 
like swings was accompanied by the drawn out  glutinous sounds
of yellow and gray foam dripping from the shore as it rose away
from the ocean  this rocking motion had been given it long ago 
probably when it was born  and it retained it thanks to its huge mass 
having observed as much as i could from my elevated vantage point 
i climbed carefully back down  it was only then  strange to relate  that
i realized the mimoid did not interest me in the slightest  that i had
come here to encounter not it  but the ocean 
     i sat down on the rough  cracked surface  a few yards from the he 
licopter  a black wave crawled sluggishly up onto the shore  spreading
and at the same time losing its color  when it retreated  the edge of
the previously untouched rock was marked with trembling filaments
of slime  i moved further down and reached out my hand to the next
wave  it faithfully repeated the phenomenon that humans had first
witnessed almost a century before  it hesitated  withdrew  then flowed
over my hand yet without touching it  in such a way that a narrow
layer of air remained between the surface of my gauntlet and the
inside of the covering  which instantly changed consistency  turning
from liquid to almost fleshy  i then raised my arm  the wave  or rather
its narrow tongue  followed it upwards  continuing to encase my hand
in an ever more transparent dirty green encystment  i rose to my
feet  otherwise i wouldnt have been able to lift my arm any further 
a shaft of the gelatinous substance stretched like a vibrating violin
string  but did not break off  the base of the entirely flattened wave 
like a strange creature waiting patiently for the end of these experi 
ments  clung to the shore around my feet  also without coming into
contact with them   it looked as if a ductile flower had grown out of
the ocean  its calyx encircling my fingers in such a way that it became
their exact negative  though without touching them  i stepped back 
the stem of the flower shuddered and  as if reluctantly  it returned
toward the ground   elastic  swaying  unsure  the wave gathered 
drawing it into itself  and disappeared from the edge of the shore  i
repeated the game until at some point like a hundred years ago 
one of the waves receded indifferently  as if having had enough of the
new experience  and i knew that id have had to wait several hours
to revive its  curiosity   i took my seat as before  but as if changed
by this theoretically familiar phenomenon that i had provoked  theory
was quite incapable of conveying the actual experience 
     in the budding  growth  and spread of this living formation  in
each of its movements separately and in all taken together  there was
something one was tempted to call a cautious yet not timid naivety  as
it strove frantically and rapidly to know  to take in  an unexpectedly
encountered new shape  then  in mid journey  it had to withdraw
when it was in danger of transgressing certain boundaries established
by a mysterious law  this agile inquisitiveness was so utterly at odds
with the immensity that stretched to every bright horizon  i had never
before been so aware of its vast presence  its powerful  inexorable si 
lence breathing evenly through its waves  staring in wonderment  i
was descending to regions of inertia that might have seemed inacces 
sible  and in the gathering intensity of engrossment i was becoming
one with this fluid unseeing colossus  as if without the slightest ef 
fort  without words  without a single thought i was forgiving it for
everything 
     for the whole of the final week i behaved so sensibly that the
distrustful glint in  s eye eventually stopped harassing me  on
the outside i was calm  secretly  without being fully conscious of it  i
was expecting something  what  her return  how could i  each of us
is aware hes a material being  subject to the laws of physiology and
physics  and that the strength of all our emotions combined cannot
counteract those laws  it can only hate them  the eternal belief of
lovers and poets in the power of love  which is more enduring than
death  the finis vitae sed non amoris that has pursued us through the
centuries  is a lie  but this lie is not ridiculous  its simply futile  to
be a clock  on the other hand  measuring the passage of time  one
that is smashed and rebuilt over and again  one in whose mechanism
despair and love are set in motion by the watchmaker along with the
first movements of the cogs  to know one is a repeater of suffering felt
ever more deeply as it becomes increasingly comical through multiple
repetitions  to replay human existence fine  but to replay it in the
way a drunk replays a corny tune  pushing coins over and over into the
jukebox  i didnt believe for a minute that this liquid colossus  which
had brought about the death of hundreds of humans within itself  with
which my entire race had for decades been trying in vain to establish
at least a thread of communication that this ocean  lifting me up
unwittingly like a speck of dust  could be moved by the tragedy of
two human beings  but its actions were geared towards some purpose 
true  even this i was not completely certain of  yet to leave meant to
strike out that perhaps slim  perhaps only imagined chance concealed
in the future  and thus years amid furniture  objects  that we had
both touched  in air that still remembered her breathing  in the name
of what  the hope of her return  i had no hope  yet expectation
lived on in me the last thing she had left behind  what further
consummations  mockeries  torments did i still anticipate  i had no
idea  as i abided in the unshaken belief that the time of cruel wonders
was not yet over
