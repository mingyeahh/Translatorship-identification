the corridor was empty  it first led straight  then curved to the right 
id never been on the station before but  as part of my preparatory
training  for six weeks id lived in an exact copy of it on earth  at the
institute  i knew where the aluminum steps led  the library was in
darkness  i felt for the light switch  when i found the first volume
of the yearbook of solaristics along with its appendix in the index  a
small red light came on as i pressed the key  i checked in the register 
the volume had been checked out by gibarian  along with another
book  the aforementioned minor apocrypha  i turned the light off and
went back downstairs  i was afraid to go into his cabin  despite the
footsteps id heard before  she could have gone back there  for some
time i stood outside the door  till eventually i gritted my teeth  got a
grip on myself and entered 
    the illuminated room was empty  i started rifling through the
books scattered on the floor by the window  at a certain moment i
went up to the locker and closed it  i couldnt look at that empty
place among the overalls  the appendix was not to be found by the
window  i went through each book in turn  till i got to the last pile
that lay between the locker and the bed  there i found the volume i
was looking for 
    id hoped to find some clue in it  and in fact  there was a bookmark
inserted at the index of names  underlined in red pencil was a name
that meant nothing to me  andre berton  it appeared on two different
pages  i found the first of these and learned that berton had been
the co pilot on shannahans ship  the next mention of his name was
over a hundred pages later  immediately after landing  the expedition
had proceeded with extreme caution  but when after sixteen days
it transpired that the plasmic ocean not only showed no signs of
aggression  but retreated from any object moved close to its surface
and  whenever it could  avoided direct contact with instruments or
people  shannahan and his second in command timolis lifted some
of the restrictions on activities that had been imposed as precautions 
since these restrictions seriously impeded the work that was to be
done 
     at that time the expedition was divided into small two  or three 
person teams  each carrying out flights over the ocean that were often
several hundred miles in duration  the sweepers that had previously
been used to close off the research area were left at the base  the first
four days after this change of method went without any incident  aside
from occasional damage to the oxygen apparatus on the space suits 
since the exhaust valves proved susceptible to the corrosive effect of
the toxic atmosphere  because of this they had to be replaced almost
daily 
     on the fifth day  or the twenty first counting from the moment of
landing  two scientists  carucci and fechner  the first was a radiolo 
gist  the second a physicist   conducted an exploratory flight over the
ocean in a small two person airmobile  it wasnt a flying craft but a
boat that moves on a cushion of condensed air 
     when they failed to return after six hours  timolis  who was in
charge at the base during shannahans absence  ordered the alarm
to be sounded and sent all available personnel out to search for the
missing men 
     by a disastrous coincidence radio contact was lost that day about
an hour after the search parties set out  this was caused by a large
sunspot on the red sun releasing a powerful burst of corpuscular
radiation into the upper reaches of the atmosphere  only ultra short 
wave equipment worked  allowing communication at a distance of no
more than twelve or fifteen miles  to make matters worse  before the
sun set the mist thickened and the search had to be interrupted 
     when the search parties were already on their way back to the
base one of them found the airmobile no more than 80 miles from the
shore  its engine was working and the craft was drifting undamaged
on the waves  only one man  carucci  was found in the cockpit 
barely conscious 
     the airmobile was brought back to the base and carucci was
given medical treatment  that same evening he recovered  he was
unable to say anything about what had happened to fechner  he only
remembered that when theyd already decided to head back he had
started to have difficulty breathing  the exhaust valve of his apparatus
had been jamming  and at each inbreath a small amount of toxic gas
had gotten into his space suit 
     fechner must have unfastened his seatbelt and stood up as he
attempted to fix the other mans equipment  that was the last thing
carucci remembered  according to the experts  the probable subse 
quent course of events had been as follows  as he worked on caruccis
oxygen pack  fechner had opened the roof of the cockpit  probably
because it was low and cramped his movements  this was permissi 
ble  since on such craft the cabin is not hermetic anyway and merely
provides protection against wind and atmospheric conditions  dur 
ing these operations fechners own apparatus must have developed
a fault  growing light headed  he had climbed up through the roof 
gotten onto the top of the airmobile  and fallen into the ocean 
     such is the story of the oceans first victim  a search for the
body  which ought to have floated on the waves in its space suit  was
unsuccessful  though it might have drifted  it was beyond the expe 
ditions capabilities to comb thousands of square miles of undulating
emptiness almost permanently covered with stretches of mist 
     to return to the previous events  by nightfall all the search teams
had returned  with the exception of a large freight helicopter that
berton had taken 
     he appeared over the base almost an hour after darkness had
fallen  when there were already serious fears for his safety  he was in
a state of nervous shock  he climbed out of the helicopter unaided 
only to try to run away  restrained  he shouted and wept  in a man
with seventeen years experience of space flight  often in the most
punishing conditions  this was quite extraordinary 
     the doctors suspected that berton too was suffering from poison 
ing  though he ostensibly regained his senses  he refused even for a
moment to leave the expeditions main rocket ship  nor would he go
up to the window  from which the ocean could be seen  after two
days berton declared he wished to submit a report concerning his
flight  he insisted  claiming it was a matter of the utmost importance 
when this report was examined by the expeditions advisory board it
was determined to be the morbid product of a mind poisoned by the
toxic gases of the atmosphere  as such it was included not in the
records of the expedition but in bertons medical case history  upon
which the whole matter was closed 
     so much was said in the appendix  i surmised that the heart of
the matter lay in bertons actual report what it was that had led a
long distance pilot to suffer a nervous breakdown  i looked once again
through the piles of books  but i couldnt find the minor apocrypha 
i was feeling more and more tired  so i put off further searching till
the next day  and left the cabin  as i passed the aluminum stairs i
saw patches of light from above  so sartorius was still working at this
hour  i decided i ought to pay him a visit 
     upstairs it was a little warmer  there was a faint draft in the wide 
low ceilinged corridor  the strips of paper across the air vents were
fluttering furiously  the door of the main lab consisted of a thick plate
of textured glass in a metal frame  the glass had been covered with
something dark from inside  light issued only from a narrow window
beneath the ceiling  i pressed on the bar  as i had expected  the door
did not yield  inside there was silence  broken from time to time by
what sounded like the low hiss of a bunsen burner  i knocked  there
was no response 
      sartorius   i called out   dr  sartorius  its me  kelvin  the new
arrival  i have to see you  open up  please  
     there was a soft rustle  like someone walking on crumpled papers 
then silence again 
      its me  kelvin  you must have heard about me  i arrived a few
hours ago from the prometheus   i said loudly  positioning my mouth
close to the place where the metal door frame met the jamb   dr 
sartorius  theres no one else here  only me  please open up  
    silence  then the faint rustle again  a few clinking sounds  very
distinct  as if someone were placing metal implements on a metal
tray  then suddenly i was thunderstruck  there came a series of tiny
footsteps  like the toddling of a small child a rapid  hurried patter
of small feet  perhaps      perhaps someone was just imitating it 
masterfully drumming their fingers on an empty box 
     dr  sartorius    i yelled   are you going to open the door or not   
    there was no response  only that childlike pattering again  and at
the same time a few rapid  barely audible  long steps  as if the person
were walking on tiptoe  but if he was walking  surely he couldnt
simultaneously imitate a childs footsteps  though what did i care 
i thought to myself  and no longer holding back the anger that was
building up in me i roared 
     dr  sartorius   i havent been traveling for sixteen months just to
be brought to a halt by some playacting of yours   im counting to ten 
then im going to break down the door   
    i doubted it would work 
    gas pistols arent very powerful  but i was determined to carry out
my threat one way or another  even if it meant looking for explosives 
which for sure would be plentifully available in the depository  i told
myself i mustnt give in  in other words i mustnt keep playing with
these cards  marked with madness  that the situation had stuck in my
hand 
    there was a noise that sounded like someone wrestling with
someone else  or pushing something  the dark sheet covering the
inside of the door moved aside a foot and a half or so  a slender
shadow appeared in the lusterless frosted pane  and a slightly hoarse 
high pitched voice said 
     ill open the door  but you have to give me your word youll not
come in  
     then why open it   i thundered 
     ill come out to you  
     all right  you have my word  
    there was the faint click of a key turning in the lock  then
the dark silhouette covering half the door carefully pulled the cover
back in place  some kind of complicated maneuvers were carried out
inside i heard what sounded like the creak of a wooden table being
moved then finally the door opened just enough to allow sartorius
to slip out into the corridor  he stood before me  shielding the door
with his body  he was extremely tall and thin  under his cream 
colored undershirt his body looked to be nothing but bones  he wore
a black scarf around his neck  a folded lab coat dotted with reagent
burns was draped over his arm  his narrow head was tilted to the
side  almost half his face was hidden behind a pair of wrap around
black glasses  so i couldnt see his eyes  he had a long lower jaw 
blueish lips  and huge ears that were also blue and looked frostbitten 
he was unshaven  red rubber anti radiation gloves hung from his
wrists on loops  we stood for a moment  eyeing each other with
unconcealed animosity  what was left of his hair  he looked as if hed
given himself a buzzcut  was the color of lead  while his beard was
completely gray  his forehead was sunburned  like snauts  but the
color ended at a horizontal line halfway to his hairline  hed evidently
worn some kind of cap the whole time he was in the sun 
     how can i help you   he said finally  i had the impression he
wasnt waiting to see what i would say  so much as listening closely
to the space behind him  his back pressed up the whole time against
the glass pane of the door  for a good while i couldnt think of how
to open without sounding foolish 
     my name is kelvin      you must have heard about me   i began 
 i am  or rather  i was  gibarians colleague      
    his skinny face  crisscrossed with horizontal lines this was what
don quixote must have looked like was expressionless  the bulging
black surface of the dark glasses directed towards me made it ex 
tremely hard for me to talk 
     i heard that gibarian      passed away   i paused 
     yes  how can i help  
    he sounded impatient 
     did he commit suicide  who found the body  doctor you or
snaut  
     why are you asking me  did dr  snaut not tell you        
     id like to hear what you have to say about the matter      
       youre a psychologist  dr  kelvin  
       yes  what of it  
       a scholar  
       well  yes  what relevance does that have  
       i thought perhaps you were a detective or a police officer  its two
forty  and you  dr  kelvin instead of seeking to familiarize yourself
with the work being conducted on the station  which would after
all be understandable despite your brutal attempt to break into the
laboratory youre questioning me as if i were at the very least a
suspect  
      i controlled myself  though the effort brought beads of sweat to
my forehead 
       you are a suspect  sartorius   i said through clenched teeth 
      i wanted to needle him at any cost  and so i added unrelentingly 
       as youre perfectly well aware  
       if you do not retract that remark and apologize  kelvin  i shall
bring a complaint against you in my next radio report  
       what am i supposed to apologize for  for the fact that  instead
of welcoming me  instead of properly briefing me on whats been
happening  you lock the door and barricade yourself in the laboratory 
have you completely lost your mind   are you a scientist or a coward  
eh  what do you have to say for yourself    i dont know exactly what
else i said  he didnt even flinch  thick beads of perspiration were
trickling down his pale large pored face  all at once i realized he
wasnt even listening to me  he kept both his hands behind him  with
all his strength holding the door shut  it was shuddering slightly  as
if someone were pushing on it from the other side 
       you      should      go   he whined suddenly in a strange shrill
voice   you should      for the love of god  go now  go downstairs 
ill come  ill come down  ill do whatever you want  but please go   
      there was such torment in his voice that  in a state of bewilder 
ment  instinctively i raised my hand to try and help him keep the
door shut  because that was evidently what he was struggling with 
but he gave a fearful cry  as if id threatened him with a knife  so i
began to back away  he kept shouting in that high voice   go  go  
and then   im coming back  ill be back right away   no  no   
     he cracked open the door and darted inside  i thought i caught
a glimpse of something gold colored  like a shiny disk  at the level of
his chest  there now came a muffled commotion from inside  the
cover over the door was knocked aside  a large tall shadow flashed
across the pane  the cover was put back in place and nothing more
could be seen  what on earth was happening in there  there was the
sound of footsteps  the crazy ruckus broke off with a terrifying clatter
of glass  and i heard a burst of laughter from a child     
     my legs were shaking  i looked around me  everything fell silent 
i perched on a low plastic windowsill  i sat there for perhaps fifteen
minutes  i couldnt say if i was waiting for something or had simply
been brought to such a pass that i didnt even have it in me to stand 
my head was splitting  somewhere high up i heard a prolonged
grinding sound and at the same time the place grew lighter 
     from where i sat i could see only part of the circular corridor
that ran around the laboratory  it was located at the very top of
the station  right under the exterior armor plating  for this reason
the outside walls were concave and sloping  with windows like loop 
holes set into them every few yards  the external shades were just
retracting  as the blue day was drawing to a close  a blinding glare
burst through the thick glass  every nickel plated piece of trim  every
door handle burned like a little sun  the lab door with its pane of
rough glass glowed like the opening of a furnace  i looked at my
hands  which lay in my lap and had turned gray in this ghastly light 
in the right i was holding the gas pistol  i had no clue when or how
id taken it out of its holster  i put it back  i knew by now that even
an atomic blaster would be no use  what could i do with one  break
down the door  force my way into the lab 
     i stood up  the disk descending into the ocean  looking like a
hydrogen explosion  sent a cluster of almost material horizontal rays
in my direction  when they struck my cheek  i was already walking
down the stairs  it felt like a red hot brand 
     halfway down the steps i changed my mind and went back up  i
circled the lab  as i mentioned  the corridor ran all the way around
it  after a hundred yards or so i found myself on its far side  outside
an identical glass door  i didnt even try to open it  i knew it would
be locked 
     i looked for some kind of window in the plastic wall  even just a
chink  the idea of spying on sartorius didnt seem at all dishonorable
to me  i wanted to put an end to conjecture and learn the truth 
though i couldnt imagine how i would understand it 
     it occurred to me that the labs were lit from skylights in the
ceiling  or rather in the exterior plating  and if i went outside i might
be able to see in from there  to this end id need to go downstairs
and get a space suit and oxygen tank  i stood by the stairs  wondering
if it was worth the effort  the skylights were likely made of matted
glass  but what other option did i have  i went down to the middle
level  i had to pass by the radio station  the door was wide open  he
was sitting in the armchair  in the same position id left him in  he
was asleep  at the sound of my footsteps he stirred and opened his
eyes 
      hey there  kelvin   he croaked  i remained silent   so did you
find anything out   he asked 
      actually yes   i replied slowly   hes not alone  
     snaut made a face 
      how about that  thats something  he has guests  you say  
      i dont understand why none of you will say what it is   i put in
as if casually   i mean  ill be staying here so sooner or later ill find
out anyway  so why all the secrets  
      youll understand when you have your own guests   he said  i
had the feeling he was waiting for something and wasnt in the mood
to talk 
      where are you going   he asked sharply when i turned around 
i didnt reply  the docking bay was in the same state as when id
left it earlier  my scorched capsule stood wide open on the pad  i
went up to the spacesuit racks  but id suddenly lost interest in the
idea of venturing out to the plating atop the station  i spun on my
heel and went down the spiral stairs to where the depositories were 
the narrow corridor was cluttered with canisters and piles of cases 
the walls here were made of bare metal that glinted lividly in the
light  a few dozen yards and the frost covered pipes of the cooling
apparatus came into view beneath the ceiling  i traced them back 
they disappeared via a thick plastic sleeve into a hermetically sealed
room  when i opened the heavy door  which was two hand widths
thick and lined with rubber  a blast of cold chilled me to the bone 
i shivered  icicles hung from a tangle of snow coated coils  here
too there were crates and capsules  under a thin layer of snow  the
shelves lining the walls were stacked with cans and yellow blocks of
some kind of fat packed in clear plastic  further off  the barrel vaulted
ceiling dropped lower  in this place there was a thick curtain glittering
with ice needles  i pulled it aside  a large elongated shape lay on
a pallet beneath a sheet of gray fabric  i raised the hem and looked
into the stiffened face of gibarian  his black hair  with the gray streak
over the forehead  lay flat against his skull  his adams apple jutted
upwards  breaking the line of his neck  his dry eyes stared straight
up at the ceiling  a cloudy tear of ice had formed in the corner of
his eyelid  the cold was so piercing i had trouble preventing my
teeth from chattering  holding the shroud up  with my other hand i
touched his cheek  it was exactly like touching frozen wood  the skin
was rough with stubble  which poked through in small black points 
an expression of boundless disdainful patience had set on his lips  as
i lowered the edge of the cloth  i noticed that on the far side of the
body some elongated black beads or beans  arranged from smallest
to largest  were poking out from under the folds  all at once i was
petrified 
     it was the toes of bare feet seen from underneath  the oval
pads protruded somewhat  beneath the crumpled edge of the shroud 
pressed flat against the pallet  lay the black woman 
     she was face down  as if plunged in a deep sleep  i pulled aside
the sheet inch by inch  her head  covered in small tufts of bluish
hair  rested in the crook of her massive  equally black arm  the
bumps of her spinal column tightened the glistening skin across her
back  her immense body showed not the slightest sign of movement 
once again i looked at the bottoms of her bare feet and i was struck
by something odd  they werent flattened or squashed by the weight
they must have had to carry  they werent even callused from walking
barefoot  but were covered with a skin that was as thin as that on her
back or hands 
     i tested this impression with a touch that was much more diffi 
cult than touching the dead body  what happened then was quite
incredible  her body  subjected to a temperature below zero degrees
fahrenheit  came to life and stirred  she drew up her foot like a
sleeping dog when you take hold of its paw 
     shell freeze to death in here  i thought to myself  but her body
was tranquil and not especially cold  i could still feel the soft touch
moving through my fingertips  i stepped back behind the curtain 
let it fall  and returned to the corridor  it felt extraordinarily hot
out there  stairs led me out to right by the docking bay  i sat on
a furled parachute and took my head in my hands  i felt as if id
been beaten up  i didnt know what was happening to me  i was
shattered  my thoughts seemed to be moving along the edge of a cliff 
in danger of falling off at any moment annihilation or at least loss
of consciousness would have been a unutterable  unattainable act of
grace 
     i had no reason to go see snaut or sartorius  i couldnt imagine
assembling into any kind of whole all id experienced  seen  touched
with my own hands up to this point  the only resort  way out 
explanation  was a diagnosis of insanity  yes  i must have gone mad 
immediately after i landed  the ocean had affected my brain in such
a way id had one hallucination after another  and since this was
the case  there was no point in wasting my energy on vain attempts
to solve mysteries that in reality did not exist  but instead i should
seek medical assistance  call the prometheus or another ship from the
radio station  send an sos 
     at this point something happened that i scarcely expected  the
thought that i had lost my mind calmed me down 
     i understood only too well what snaut had said if in fact anyone
called snaut even existed  and i had ever spoken to him  because after
all  the hallucinations could have begun much earlier  who knows if
i wasnt still on board the prometheus  struck down by a sudden bout
of mental illness  and everything id experienced to this point was the
product of a disturbed mind  yet if i was sick i could get better  and
that at least gave me the hope of deliverance  something i couldnt
remotely see being possible among the tangled nightmares of what id
lived through on solaris in the space of a few short hours 
     what i needed to do  then  was to conduct some kind of logically
designed experiment on myself an experimentum crucis which would
show me whether in fact id gone mad and was at the mercy of phan 
toms created by my own imagination  or whether  however absurd and
improbable they were  these experiences were in fact real 
     i thought about it all as i gazed at the metal cantilever that sup 
ported the weight bearing structure of the docking bay  it took the
form of a steel mast jutting from the wall and reinforced with convex
plates  it was painted willow green  in places  at a height of about
three feet  the paint was coming off  it had probably been scraped by
the rocket carts as they were moved that way  i touched the steel 
warming it for a moment with my hand  and tapped the rolled edge
of the protective casing  was it possible for a hallucination to reach
such a level of realism  perhaps  i answered myself  after all  that was
my area of specialization  i knew what i was talking about 
     but could such a critical experiment be designed  to begin with
i thought not  because my sick brain  if indeed it was sick  would
produce any illusion i required of it  after all  its not just in sickness 
even in the most ordinary dream we find ourselves conversing with
people we do not know in our waking life  asking these dream figures
questions and hearing their answers  when this happens  even though
the figures are in fact only products of our own mind  parts of which
have temporarily become detached and given a fake independence 
we still dont know what words they will utter until  in that dream 
they speak to us  yet in reality the words are concocted by that other 
separated part of our own mind  and so we ought to know them at the
moment we think them up and put them in the mouth of a fictional
character  whatever i might plan and carry out  then  i could always
tell myself i was acting the way we act in dreams  neither snaut nor
sartorius needed to even exist in reality  and so asking either of them
questions was pointless 
     it occurred to me that i could take some powerful medication  like
peyote for example  or something else that produces hallucinations or
graphic visions  experiencing such things would prove that what i
had taken really existed and was a part of the material reality sur 
rounding me  but  i thought further  that too would not be the critical
experiment i was after  because i knew how the substance  which i of
course would have to select  ought to act on me  and so it could also
be the case that both the taking of the medication and the effects it
caused were equally products of my imagination 
    i was already thinking there was no way out of the vicious circle
of madness after all  no one can think with anything but his brain 
no one can be outside himself to check whether the processes taking
place in his body are normal  then suddenly i was struck by an idea
that was as simple as it was apt 
    i jumped up from the pile of parachutes and ran straight to the
radio station  it was empty  i glanced at the electric wall clock 
it was coming up to four in the agreed upon night of the station 
because outside a red dawn was breaking  i quickly turned on the
long distance radio equipment  and as i waited for the lamps to warm
up  in my mind i went over the various stages of the experiment 
    i couldnt remember the call signal for the automatic station of
the planetary satelloid  but i found it on the bulletin board over the
main console  i called it up in morse code  eight seconds later came
the response  the satelloid  or rather its electronic brain  reported in
with a repeated rhythmic signal 
    i requested it to tell me which meridians of the galactic canopy it
was passing at twenty second intervals as it orbited solaris  i asked
for figures to the fifth decimal place 
    then i sat down and waited for the response  it came ten minutes
later  i tore off the paper printout with the results  stuck it in a drawer
 making sure i didnt so much as glance at it first   then went to the
library and brought back large scale sky maps  logarithmic tables 
the almanac of the satellites daily movements  and a few additional
books  i then proceeded to figure out my own answer to the same
question  it took me almost an hour to set up the equations  i dont
remember the last time i performed such difficult computations it
was probably in school  during my practical astronomy exam 
    i carried out the work on the stations huge calculator  my rea 
soning was as follows  from the sky maps i ought to derive figures
that were not exactly the same as those provided by the satelloid 
since the satelloid was subject to complex perturbations as a result
of solariss gravitational pull  of its two mutually orbiting suns  and
also local variations in gravitation caused by the ocean  when i had
both sets of figures  those provided by the satelloid and those calcu 
lated theoretically on the basis of the sky maps  id correct my own
reckonings  at this point the two groups of results ought to match to
the fourth decimal place  discrepancies would remain only in the fifth
decimal place  as being caused by the unpredictable influence of the
ocean 
    even if the figures the satelloid provided were not real but a prod 
uct of my own crazy mind  they still couldnt match the other series of
numbers even if my brain was sick  it would not be capable under
any circumstances of the computations performed by the stations
calculator  such a thing would have required months of work  so
then  if the figures tallied  the calculator existed in reality and i was
actually using it  not just imagining i was 
    my hands were trembling as i took the telegraphic printout from
the drawer and spread it out next to the other  wider sheet from the
calculator  both lists of figures matched as i had predicted  to the
fourth decimal place  discrepancies appeared only in the fifth 
    i put all the papers into the drawer  so the calculator existed
independently of me  this meant that the station and everything on
it was also real 
    i was about to close the drawer when i noticed it was filled with
a whole wad of papers covered in hasty calculations  i pulled them
out  a single glance was enough to see that someone else had already
carried out an experiment like mine  the only difference being that in 
stead of data from the star canopy this person had asked the satelloid
for information about solariss reflectivity at forty second intervals 
    i was not mad  the last ray of hope had faded  i turned off the
transmitter  finished what was left of the bouillon in the flask  and
went to bed
