i was lying on my back  without a thought  her head on my shoulder 
the darkness filling the room was becoming populated  i could hear
steps  the walls were disappearing  something was towering over me 
bigger and bigger  endless  i was penetrated through and through 
embraced without being touched  i froze still in the darkness  feeling
its acute transparency that was displacing the air  i could hear a heart
very far away  i focused my whole attention  all the strength i had left 
on expecting death throes  they didnt come  i just kept shrinking 
while the unseen sky  the unseen horizons  the emptiness  devoid of
shapes  clouds  stars  drawing back and swelling  was making me its
center  i strove to crawl into the thing i was lying on  but beneath me
there was no longer anything and the darkness no longer concealed
anything  i clenched my fists and hid my face in them  i no longer
had one  my fingers passed all the way through  i felt like shouting 
howling     
     the room was blue gray  the furniture  walls  corners seemed
sketched in broad dull strokes  in outline only  with no color of their
own  there was the brightest pearly white in the silence outside the
window  my body was drenched in sweat  i glanced to the side  she
was looking at me 
      is your shoulder numb  
      what  
     she raised her head  her eyes were the same hue as the room 
gray  luminous between her dark lashes  i felt the warmth of her
whisper before i understood the words 
      no  actually  yes  
     i placed my hand on her back  the touch teemed  i slowly pulled
her to me with my other arm 
      you were having a bad dream   she said 
      a dream  oh  thats right  were you not asleep  
      i dont know  maybe not  im not tired  but you should sleep 
why are you looking at me like that  
     i half closed my eyes  i could feel the small regular thump of
her heart where mine beat slower  a prop  i thought to myself  but
i wasnt surprised by anything  even my own indifference  i was
beyond fear and despair  i was further on  no one had ever gone that
far  i touched her neck with my lips  then went lower down  to the
little hollow between the tendons  that was smooth as the inside of a
seashell  the pulse was there too 
     i lifted myself on an elbow  there were no dawns  no softness of
light  the horizon was filled with an electric blue glow  the first ray
crossed the room like a shot  there was a sudden play of rainbow 
colored reflections refracted in the mirror  in the door handles  the
nickel plated pipes  the light appeared to be striking against every
surface it encountered as if it were trying to break free  to burst the
confined space open  by now it was impossible to look  i turned
around  hareys pupils dilated  her gray irises rose to my face 
      is it time for day already   she asked in a lusterless voice  she
seemed half asleep  half awake 
      its always like that here  honey  
      and us  
      what about us  
      are we going to be here for a long time  
     i felt like laughing  but when an indistinct sound burst from my
chest  it didnt resemble a laugh 
      for quite a while  i think  do you not want that  
     her eyelids werent twitching  she was looking at me intently  was
she winking  i couldnt be sure  she pulled the blanket up  on her
arm i saw a small triangular pink mark 
      why are you staring like that  
      because youre beautiful  
     she smiled  but it was only out of politeness  a thank you for the
compliment 
      really  because youre looking at me as if you      as if i      
      what  
      as if you were searching for something  
      come off it  
      no  its like you thought there was something wrong with me  or
there was something i wasnt telling you  
      not at all  
      if you insist  then im sure thats so  but as you wish  
     outside the flaming windows a lifeless blue heat was coming into
being  shading my eyes with my hand  i looked around for my dark
glasses  they were on the table  i knelt on the bed  put them on 
and caught sight of her reflection in the window  she was waiting for
something  when i lay back down beside her she smiled 
      what about for me  
     i suddenly understood 
      sunglasses  
     i got up and started rummaging through the drawers of the table
by the window  i found two pairs  both too big  i handed them to
her  she tried each pair  they slipped half way down her nose 
     the window shades began to descend with their prolonged grind 
ing sound  a moment later and it was night inside the station  which
had crawled into its shell like a turtle  going by touch alone  i took
her glasses off and put them with mine under the bunk 
      what are we going to do   she asked 
      what people do at night sleep  
      kris  
      what  
      maybe i should make you a new dressing  
      no  theres no need  theres no need      darling  
     as i said it  i didnt know myself if i was pretending  but a moment
later  without seeing i put my arms around her slender back and when
i felt it tremble  i suddenly believed in her  though im not sure  all
at once i felt i was the one deceiving her  not the other way around 
because she was only herself 
     after that i drifted off to sleep several times and kept being woken
from my doze by a cramp  my hammering heart gradually calmed
down  i held her close  dead tired  she touched my face and forehead
gingerly  checking to see if i didnt have a fever  this was harey 
another  truer one could not have existed 
     after that thought something changed inside me  i stopped strug 
gling  i fell asleep almost immediately 
     i was woken by a gentle touch  there was a pleasant coolness
on my forehead  my face was covered with something moist and soft
that was slowly being lifted up  i saw hareys face leaning over me 
with both hands she was squeezing out the excess fluid from the
gauze into a porcelain bowl  nearby stood a bottle of sunburn cream 
she smiled at me 
      boy  did you sleep   she said  then as she laid the gauze back 
 does that hurt  
      no  
     i moved the skin on my forehead  it was true  i couldnt feel the
burns now  harey was sitting on the edge of the bunk  wrapped in
an orange and white striped mans bathrobe  her black hair lay spread
over the collar  shed rolled the sleeves all the way up to the elbows so
they wouldnt get in the way  i was feeling extraordinarily hungry 
it must have been twenty hours since id last eaten  when harey
finished dressing my face i got up  i suddenly caught sight of the two
completely identical white dresses with red buttons  which lay side by
side  the first was the one id helped her take off by cutting the back 
the second was the dress shed come in the day before  this time
shed unpicked the seam herself with a small pair of scissors  saying
the zipper must have gotten stuck 
     the two identical dresses were the most terrible thing of all id
experienced till now  harey was busy tidying the medicine cabinet 
i turned away from her surreptitiously and bit my fist till it bled 
still staring at the two dresses or rather the same dress repeated
two times i began backing towards the door  water was still noisily
running from the faucet  i opened the door  slipped quietly out and
closed it carefully  i could hear the faint murmur of the running water
and the clatter of bottles  then  suddenly  the sound stopped  the
strip lighting from the ceiling illuminated the corridor  a hazy patch of
reflected light lay on the door  by which i was waiting with clenched
jaw  i held the handle  though i didnt expect to be able to keep
the door closed  a sudden tug almost wrenched it out of my hand 
but the door didnt open  it just shook and started creaking horribly 
stunned  i let go of the handle and took a step back  something quite
incredible was happening with the door its smooth plastic surface
was cratering inwards as if it was being pressed into the room from
my side  the enamel began cracking off in small flakes  exposing the
steel frame  which was straining ever more  i suddenly realized that
instead of pushing the door  which opened towards the corridor  she
was trying to open it by pulling it towards herself  the reflection of
the light curved on the white surface like a concave mirror  there was
a powerful crunching sound and the solid panel  bent to its limit 
made a snapping noise  at the same time the handle was ripped
from its mount and flew into the room  in the hole it left  there
immediately appeared a pair of bloodied hands that kept on pulling 
leaving red streaks on the enamel  the panel of the door broke in
two  hung crookedly on its hinges  and an orange and white creature
with a livid blue  lifeless face threw its arms around me sobbing 
    if i hadnt been paralyzed by what id seen i probably would have
attempted to run  harey was gasping for breath  knocking her head
against my shoulder  her hair flying every which way  when i held
her i could feel her slipping through my arms  i carried her back
into the room  squeezing past the shattered door  and laid her on the
bunk  her fingernails were broken and covered with blood  when she
turned her hand i saw the palm was chafed to raw flesh  i looked into
her face  her wide open eyes stared through me expressionless 
     harey  
    she responded with an inarticulate grunt 
    i moved my finger close to her eye  the lid closed  i went to the
medicine cabinet  the bunk creaked  i turned around  she was sitting
up straight  gazing at her bloodied hands in alarm 
     kris   she moaned   i      i      what happened to me  
     you hurt yourself breaking down the door   i said impassively 
there was a feeling in my lips  especially the lower one  as if ants
were crawling all over it  i clamped it between my teeth 
    harey looked for a moment at the jagged pieces of plastic hanging
loose from the frame and turned her eyes to me  her chin trembled 
i could see her struggling to master her alarm 
    i cut a strip of gauze  took some powder for abrasions from the
cabinet  and went back to the bunk  but all at once everything i was
carrying slipped out of my hands  the glass jar with its gelatin seal
broke  but i didnt even pick it up  it was no longer needed 
    i picked up her hand  there was a still a faint outline of blood
around the fingernails  but the bruising had disappeared  and the
palm was covered with fresh pink skin that was lighter than its sur 
roundings  though the wound was fading almost as i watched 
    i sat down  stroked her cheek and tried to smile at her  though i
cant say i succeeded 
     why did you do it  harey  
     no  that was      me  
    she indicated the door with her eyes 
     yes  dont you remember  
     no  i mean  i saw you were gone  i got really scared  and      
     and what  
     i started looking for you  i thought maybe you were in the
bathroom      
    it was only now i noticed that the locker had been slid aside to
reveal the entrance to the bathroom 
     and then  
     i ran to the door  
     and  
     i dont remember  something must have happened  
     what  
     i dont know  
     what do you remember  what happened next  
     i was sitting here on the bed  
     you dont remember me carrying you here  
    she hesitated  the corners of her mouth drooped  her face was
intent 
     i guess  maybe  i really cant say  
    she lowered her feet to the floor and stood up  she went up to
the broken door 
     kris  
    i put my arms around her shoulders from behind  she was shak 
ing  all at once she turned and sought my eyes 
     kris   she whispered   kris  
     take it easy  
     kris  what if      kris  do i have epilepsy  
    epilepsy  dear god  i felt like laughing 
     of course not  darling  its just a door  you know  they have these
kind of doors here      
    we left the room when the outer plating rose over the windows
with its drawn out grinding sound  revealing the disk of the sun set 
ting into the ocean 
    i headed for the small galley at the far end of the corridor  harey
and i worked together  checking out the cabinets and refrigerators  i
quickly realized she wasnt much of a cook and couldnt do a lot more
than open a few cans  much like me  i wolfed down the contents of
two of the cans and drank endless cups of coffee  harey ate too 
but the way children sometimes eat  so as not to hurt the feelings of
the grown ups not exactly forcing themselves  but mechanically and
indifferently 
    the two of us went together to the small surgery next to the radio
station  i had a plan  i told her i wanted to examine her just in case 
i sat her down in a folding chair and took a hypodermic syringe and
needle from the sterilizer  i knew where everything was almost by
heart  wed been so well prepared at the training copy of the station
on earth  i took a drop of blood from her finger  prepared a smear 
dried it in the exhauster and sprinkled it with silver ions in a high
vacuum 
    the matter of factness of this work had a calming effect  harey 
resting on the cushions of the folding chair  was looking around the
interior of the room  cluttered with apparatus 
    the silence was broken by the ringing of the internal telephone  i
picked up the receiver 
     kelvin   i said  i didnt take my eyes off harey  who for some time
now had been apathetic  as if shed been exhausted by her experiences
in the last few hours 
     youre in the surgery  finally   i heard what sounded like a sigh
of relief 
    it was snaut  i waited with the receiver pressed to my ear 
     you have a  guest  eh  
     yes  
     and youre busy  
     yes  
     a little examination perhaps  
     what of it  are you looking for a chess partner  
     give it a rest  kelvin  sartorius wants to see you  that is  see us  
     thats something new   i said  surprised   what about the       i
broke off and added 
     is he alone  
     no  i misspoke  he wants to talk with us  the three of us can
connect by visuphone  hes going to cover up the screen  
     is that so  why didnt he just call me directly  is he embar 
rassed  
     something like that   snaut muttered indistinctly   well then  
     you want to set a time  lets say in an hour  ok  
     ok  
    i could see him on the screen  just his face  no bigger than the
palm of my hand  for a moment that was filled with the faint hum
of current  he looked searchingly into my face 
    in the end he said with a certain hesitation 
     hows life  
     bearable  you  
     im guessing a bit worse than for you  could i      
     you want to come see me   i guessed  i glanced over my shoulder
at harey  her head hung over the cushion  she was lying with her legs
crossed  in her boredom absentmindedly tossing up the silver ball at
the end of a chain attached to the arm of the chair 
      leave that alone  you hear  leave it   i heard snauts raised voice 
on the screen i could see him in profile  i didnt catch the rest  he
covered the microphone with his hand  but i saw his lips move 
      no  i cant come  maybe later  in an hour  then   he said quickly 
and the screen went blank  i hung up the receiver 
      who was that   harey asked indifferently 
      just this guy  snaut  a cybernetician  you dont know him  
      is it going to take much longer  
      are you bored   i asked  i placed the first of a series of slides
in the holder of the neutrino microscope and one by one flipped the
colored switches  the force fields set up a hollow drone   theres
not much in the way of entertainment around here  if my modest
company isnt enough for you  things are going to get tough   i said 
distractedly elongating the pauses between words as i simultaneously
used both hands to pull the huge black head of the microscope toward
me  and pressed my eyes into the soft rubber cup of the gleaming
eyepiece  harey said something i didnt catch  i saw from above 
sharply foreshortened  a vast wilderness flooded by a silvery glow  on
it  in a hazy mist there lay flat round rocks that looked shattered and
weather beaten  these were the red corpuscles  i focused the image
without removing my eyes  it was as if i were sailing ever deeper into
the silvery radiance of the field of vision  at the same time  with my
left hand i operated the crank that turned the stage  and when a blood
corpuscle solitary as an erratic boulder appeared between the cross 
hairs  i increased the magnification  the lens zoomed in on what
seemed like a misshapen erythrocyte  sagging in the middle  which
already resembled the rim of a rocky crater  with distinct black shad 
ows in the indentations around its ring like edge  the rim  bristling
with crystallized accumulations of silver ions  stretched beyond the
edge of the microscopes field  murky outlines of half fused  twisting
protein chains came into view  as if seen through opalescent water 
when i had one such tangle of ruined proteins in the cross hairs  i
gradually turned the dial to bring the magnification up further and
still further  any moment now id reach the limit of this journey into
the depths  the flattened shadow of a single molecule was filling the
picture  the mist was clearing now 
    but nothing happened  i ought to have seen a trembling haze of
atoms  like a quaking jelly  but it wasnt there  the screen glowed
pure silver  i turned the dial all the way to the maximum  the hum
intensified angrily  but still i didnt see anything  a repeated buzz let
me know the apparatus was overloaded  i looked one more time into
the silver emptiness and turned off the electricity 
    i looked over at harey  she was just opening her mouth in a yawn
that she turned adroitly into a smile 
     so how am i   she asked 
     youre fine   i said   in my view      you couldnt be better  
    i kept staring at her  once again feeling that crawling sensation in
my lower lip  what had actually happened  what did it mean  this
body  seemingly so slender and frail in fact indestructible at its
deepest level had turned out to be made of nothingness  i thumped
the cylindrical casing of the microscope  maybe there was something
wrong with it  maybe the force fields werent centering  no  i knew
the equipment was in order  id gone down through all the stages 
cells  protein conglomerate  molecules  and they looked exactly as
they had on thousands of slides id seen  but the last step downwards
led nowhere 
    i drew some blood from her vein and poured it into a measuring
glass  i separated it into portions and prepared it for analysis  it took
me longer than i expected  i was out of practice  the reactions were
within expected norms  all of them  unless     
    i placed a drop of concentrated acid on the red dot in one of the
test tubes  there was smoke  the dot turned gray and disappeared
under a coating of dirty foam  this was decomposition  denaturation 
keep going  i reached for another test tube  when i turned back  the
thin glass container almost fell from my hand 
    beneath the layer of scum  at the very bottom of the tube a thin
layer of dark red was already re forming  this was nonsense  this
was impossible 
     kris   i heard as if from very far away   kris  the telephone  
     what  oh  right  thanks  
    the phone had been ringing for a long time  but it was only now
i heard it  i picked up the receiver 
      kelvin here  
      this is snaut  i hooked it up so the three of us can hear each
other at the same time  
      greetings  dr  kelvin   came sartoriuss high pitched  nasal voice 
its owner sounded like he was walking onto a dangerously sagging
platform suspicious  cautious  while on the outside collected 
      my respects  dr  sartorius   i replied  i felt like laughing  but i
wasnt sure i was clear enough about the reasons for my mirth to be
able to give it free rein  when it came down to it  who was i supposed
to be laughing at  i was holding something in my hand  the test tube
with the blood  i shook it  it had already congealed  maybe what id
just seen was merely an illusion  maybe it had merely seemed that
way 
      gentlemen  id like to raise certain issues concerning the     um   
  ghosts   i heard and at the same time did not hear sartorius  it was
as if he was trying to enter my consciousness  i fought off his voice 
still staring at the test tube with the dried blood 
      lets call them g formations   suggested snaut quickly 
      very good  
     in the middle of the screen there was a black vertical line to show
i was receiving two channels at once  there should have been the
faces of my interlocutors on either side  but the image was dark 
only the narrow border of light around the edge showed that the
equipment was working but that the screens had been covered over 
      each of us has conducted various tests   the nasal voice once
again carried the same tone of caution  there was a moment of
silence   perhaps we could first share what we have discovered  and
then i can explain the conclusions i myself have reached      you first 
perhaps  dr  kelvin      
      me   i said  i suddenly sensed hareys eyes on me  i placed the
test tube on the table  where it rolled against a stand  and sat on a
tall stool id pulled up with my foot  in the first moment i was going
to refuse  but i surprised myself by saying 
      fine  a short colloquium  fine  ive done very little  but i can
talk  one histological smear and a few reactions  microreactions  i
have the impression that  
    up till this moment id had no idea what to say  all of a sudden
it was as if something opened up inside me 
      everything is normal  but its camouflage  a mask  in some
sense its a supercopy a re creation more exact than the original 
thats to say  where in humans we encounter the limits of granularity 
the limits of divisibility of matter  here the road goes further  thanks
to the use of subatomic building matter  
     just a moment  what do you mean by that   inquired sartorius 
snaut said nothing  or perhaps it was his quickening breathing that
could be heard on the line  harey looked across at me  i became
aware of how excited i was  id almost shouted the last words  i
calmed down  hunched over on my uncomfortable perch  and closed
my eyes  how could i phrase it 
     the ultimate structural element of our bodies is the atom  i sus 
pect that g formations are built of units smaller than regular atoms 
much smaller  
     mesons   suggested sartorius  he wasnt at all surprised 
     no  not mesons      mesons would be visible  the resolu 
tion of my apparatus here downstairs is ten to the minus twentieth
angstroms  right  but nothing can be seen  all the way to the max 
so it isnt mesons  more likely neutrinos  
     how do you imagine that  after all  neutrino conglomerates are
unstable      
     i dont know  im not a physicist  maybe theyre stabilized by
some kind of force field  its not my area  in any case  if its like i
say  then the building matter consists of particles about ten thousand
times smaller than atoms  but thats not all  if the protein molecules
and cells were constructed directly from these  micro atoms  theyd
have to be correspondingly smaller  and the blood corpuscles  the
enzymes  everything  but theyre not  that means that all the pro 
teins  cells  cell nuclei theyre all just a mask  the actual structure
responsible for the functioning of the  guest is hidden deeper  
     for goodness sake  kelvin   snaut almost yelled  i broke off in
dismay  had i said  guest    yes  but harey hadnt heard it  besides 
she wouldnt have understood  she was staring out of the window  her
head resting on her hands  her small neat profile stood out against
the crimson dawn  there was silence in the receiver  i could only
hear distant breathing 
      theres something in that   snaut murmured 
      yes  its possible   added sartorius   the only problem is that the
ocean is not composed of these hypothetical particles of kelvins  its
made of regular ones  
      perhaps its able to synthesize the other kind too   i commented  i
felt a sudden sense of apathy  the conversation wasnt even amusing 
it was unnecessary 
      that would explain their extraordinary fortitude   snaut said  still
in a murmur   and the speed of regeneration  perhaps even their
energy source is there  in the depths  remember they dont need to
eat      
      i wish to say something   put in sartorius  i couldnt stand him 
if hed only step out of the role hed imposed upon himself 
      i would like to raise the question of motivation  the motivation
for the appearance of the g formations  i would break it down as
follows  what are g formations  they are not persons  nor are they
copies of specific individuals  but rather materialized projections of
what our brain contains regarding a particular person  
     the accuracy of this observation struck me  sartorius may have
been unlikeable  but he was far from stupid 
      thats good   i put in   it even explains why these peo      these
formations have appeared and not others  whats been selected are
the most enduring memory traces  those most isolated from all the
others  though naturally no such trace can be completely separated 
and in the course of being  copied the remains of other traces that
happen to be in the vicinity are  or can be  included  as a result  the
newcomer sometimes shows more knowledge than could be possessed
by the real person whose reproduction theyre supposed to be      
      kelvin   said snaut once again  i was struck by the fact that only
he was irked by my careless words  sartorius seemed unconcerned by
them  could this mean that his guest was by nature less intelligent
than snauts  for a split second i imagined some cretinous dwarf at
the side of the learned dr  sartorius 
      indeed  we have observed such a thing   said the man himself 
 now  as concerns the motivation for the appearance of g formations 
    the first and as it were natural thought is that an experiment is
being conducted upon us  yet it would not be a terribly impressive
one  when we perform an experiment we learn from the results 
in particular from our mistakes  so when we repeat it we introduce
corrections      yet there is no question of that here  the same
g formations reappear      unimproved      with no additional
protections against our      attempts to get rid of them      
      in a word  theres no cycle of action with a corrective reflex loop 
as dr  snaut would term it   i remarked   what does that mean  
      only that as an experiment it would be shoddy work  which in
fact is rather unlikely  the ocean is      precise  this is manifest in
the double layered construction of the g formations  for a start  to a
certain point they behave like the real     their real      
     he was unable to finish 
      originals   snaut suggested quickly 
      yes  originals  but where the situation exceeds the normal possi 
bilities of the  um  original  there occurs something like a  disconnec 
tion of consciousness in the g formation and another kind of action 
of an inhuman nature  is directly observed      
      thats true   i said   but in this way all were doing is compiling
a catalogue of behaviors of these      these formations  nothing more 
this is utterly futile  
      im not so certain of that   protested sartorius  all at once i
realized what it was about him that irritated me so  he didnt speak
but gave speeches  as if he were taking part in a conference at the
institute  evidently this was the only way he knew how 
      the matter of individuality arises here  the ocean is entirely
devoid of such a concept  this has to be the case  it seems to me 
gentlemen  it is completely oblivious to what for us is the most  um 
troublesome  shocking aspect of the experiment  that it lies beyond
the boundaries of its comprehension  
      you think its unintentional         i asked  this assertion took
me aback  but after a moments reflection i admitted it couldnt be
dismissed 
     thats right  i dont believe in any villainy  malice  a desire to hurt
us as painfully as possible      unlike dr  snaut  
     i dont attribute human emotions to it at all   said snaut  speaking
up for the first time   but tell us  how do you explain these perpetual
returns  
     perhaps they set up some kind of device that operates over and
over again  like a gramophone record   i said  not without a hidden
urge to needle sartorius 
     now then  gentlemen  let us not become distracted   the latter
declared in his nasal voice   that is not all i wished to say  under
normal conditions i would regard the submission of even an interim
report on my research as premature  but in light of this particular situ 
ation i shall make an exception  i have the impression  i repeat  i have
the impression  no more for the moment  that dr  kelvins conjecture
is correct  i am referring to his hypothesis about a neutrino based
structure  such structures are known to us only theoretically  we were
not aware they could be stabilized  this opens up a specific opportu 
nity  since the destruction of the force field that provides permanence
for the structure      
    for some time id been noticing that the dark object covering the
screen at sartoriuss end was shifting  at the very top of the image a
bright gap appeared and something pink could be seen moving there
slowly  now the object suddenly slipped off 
     go away  go away    came an ear splitting shout from sartorius 
in the unexpectedly lit up screen  between the doctors arms  clad in
puffy oversleeves of the kind worn in laboratories  that were wrestling
with something  a large golden disk like object flashed into view and
everything went dark before id realized the golden circle was a straw
hat     
     snaut   i said after taking a deep breath 
     yes  kelvin   the cyberneticians tired voice replied  at that mo 
ment i suddenly felt that i liked him  i truly preferred not to know
who his companion was   weve had enough for the moment  no  
     i think youre right   i replied   listen  if you can  swing by
downstairs or to my cabin  ok   i added in a hurry before he hung
up 
    all right   he said   though i dont know when itll be  
   and so ended the discussion of the problem
