The tubular corridor was empty  I stood for a moment at the closed
door  listening  The walls must have been thin  from outside there
came the whining of the wind  On the door there was a crooked
rectangle of first aid plaster that had been stuck up carelessly  bearing
the inscription   Human   I stared at the scrawled  barely legible word 
For a moment I thought about going back to Snaut  but I realized that
wasnt possible 
    His demented warning still rang in my ears  I moved off  and
my shoulders were bowed by the bothersome weight of the space
suit  Quietly  as if hiding from an unseen observer  I returned to the
circular hall with the five doors  They bore nameplates  Dr  Gibarian 
Dr  Snaut  Dr  Sartorius  On the fourth there was no name  I hesitated 
then pressed down lightly on the handle and slowly pushed  As it
opened I had the feeling  bordering on certainty  that someone was
there  I went inside 
    There was no one  An identical convex window  though slightly
smaller  looked out onto the ocean  which from here  against the sun 
shone greasily  as if reddened olive oil were dripping from the crests
of the waves  The crimson glow filled the entire room  which was like
a spaceship cabin  On one side there were shelves with books and
other items  a bunk strapped to the wall and secured with universal
joints  on the other were numerous cabinets  between which were
aerial photographs stuck together in nickel plated frames  In metal holders there were flasks and test tubes stopped with cotton wool  By
the window were two rows of white enamel cases so close together
there was hardly room to squeeze through  The lids of some of them
were half open  they were full of different kinds of tools and plastic
hoses  In both corners there were faucets  a smoke extractor  freezers 
a microscope stood on the floor  since there was no longer any room
for it on the large table next to the window  When I turned around 
right by the door I saw an open locker as high as the ceiling filled with
overalls  work wear and protective aprons  there was underwear on the
shelves  and among the anti radiation boots was the glint of aluminum
flasks for use with portable oxygen packs  Two packs complete with
masks hung from the rail of the raised bed  Everywhere there was the
same disarray  which had been only hurriedly and superficially tidied 
I sniffed the air testingly and smelled a faint aroma of chemical
reagents and the trace of a sharp odor could it possibly have been
chlorine  Instinctively my eyes sought the ventilation grates in the
upper corners of the room  The slips of paper fastened to their
frames were flapping gently to show the compressors were working 
maintaining normal air circulation  I moved the books  apparatus 
and tools from two chairs  stuffing them into the corners as best
I could  till some space was more or less cleared around the bed
between the locker and the shelves  I pulled up a stand to hang my
space suit on  I took hold of the zippers  but let go immediately  I
couldnt bring myself to take off the suit  as if it would leave me
defenseless  Once again I took in the whole room  I checked the door
was properly closed  and since there was no lock  after a moments
hesitation I pushed the two heaviest crates against it  Once this
makeshift barricade was in place  with a couple of tugs I freed myself
of the heavy  creaking garment  A narrow mirror inside the locker
reflected part of the room  Out of the corner of my eye I caught
sight of a movement there  I started  but it turned out to be my own
reflection  The shirt I had on under my space suit was drenched in
sweat  I yanked it off and pushed the locker sideways  It slid aside 
in an alcove behind it were the gleaming walls of a tiny bathroom 
On the ground under the shower was a large flat case  Not without
difficulty  I hauled it into the main room  When I laid it on the floor the lid popped open as if on a spring and I saw compartments
filled with bizarre exhibits  a host of implements similar to those in
the cabinets  but in approximate or distorted versions in dark metal 
None of them were of any use  they were misshapen  blunted  half 
melted  as if theyd been in a fire  The strangest thing was that the
handles  which were made of ceramite and so virtually unmeltable 
were damaged in the same way  No laboratory oven would have
been capable of reaching the temperatures necessary to produce this
effect unless it was inside an atomic pile  From the pocket of my
space suit I took out a small Geiger counter  but when I held it up to
the mangled tools its black beak remained silent 
     I was wearing only underwear and a loose weave tee shirt  I
tossed both on the floor like rags and  naked  jumped in the shower 
The sudden rush of water felt like relief  I twisted beneath the hard 
hot stream of water  massaging my body  snorting  all in a somehow
exaggerated way  as if I was shaking off  expelling from myself  the
whole obscure uncertainty that filled the Station with its infectious
suspicions 
     From the locker I dug out a light track suit that could also be
worn under a space suit  and transferred all my modest belongings to
its pockets  Between the pages of my notebook I felt something hard 
it was the key to my apartment on Earth  Goodness knows how it
had gotten there  I turned it in my fingers a moment  not knowing
what to do with it  In the end I laid it on the table  It occurred to
me I might need a weapon  My all purpose pocket knife certainly
wouldnt do the trick  but I didnt have anything else  and I wasnt
yet in the kind of mental state that would make me go looking for
a ray gun or anything of that kind  I sat on a metal chair in the
middle of the open space  far from all objects  I wanted to be alone 
I was glad to see I still had half an hour  I couldnt help it  exactitude
in carrying out any commitment  however important or trivial  was
always in my nature  The hands of the twenty four hour clock stood
at 7 am  The sun was setting  Seven local time was twenty hundred
hours on the Prometheus  Solaris would be shrinking to the size of
a dot on Moddards screen  it would be indistinguishable from the
stars  But what could the Prometheus matter to me  I closed my eyes 
There was total silence  aside from the whine of the pipes at regular
intervals  Water ticked softly in the bathroom as it dripped into the
porcelain basin 
     Gibarian was dead  If Id understood Snaut correctly  less than a
day had passed since his death  What had they done with the body 
Had they buried it  Oh  right  on this planet that couldnt be done  I
thought about it in a matter of fact way for a long while  as if what
had been become of the dead man was the most essential thing here 
until  realizing how ridiculous these thoughts were  I stood up and
began pacing diagonally across the room  With the tip of my foot I
kicked at the books scattered about  at a small empty field satchel 
I bent down and picked it up  It turned out not to be empty after
all  It contained a dark glass bottle that weighed so little it felt like it
was made of paper  I held it up to the window  where the last dismal
red light of the sunset was blurred by a dirty mist  What was wrong
with me  Why was I occupying myself with any old nonsense  with
whatever insignificant trifle fell to my hand 
     I gave a start the light had come on  Of course  the photo cell 
triggered by the falling dusk  I was filled with anticipation  the tension
had grown to the point where I didnt want to have open space behind
me  I decided to fight it  I moved the chair up to the shelves  I took
down a book I knew only too well the second volume of Hughes and
Eugels old History of Solaris and started flipping through it  resting
the thick  stiff spine on my lap 
     Solaris had been discovered almost a hundred years before I was
born  The planet orbits two suns  a red one and a blue one  For
over forty years no spaceship came near to it  In those days the
Gamov Shapley hypothesis  concerning the impossibility of life arising
on planets around double stars  went unquestioned  The orbits of
such planets are constantly changing from the gravitational interplay
of two suns circling around one another 
     The resulting perturbations successively reduce and expand the
planets orbit  and the beginnings of life  if they emerge  are destroyed
by radiant heat or freezing cold  These changes occur over a period
of millions of years  which is to say  on an astronomical or biological
scale  for evolution requires hundreds of millions  if not billions  of
years  a very short time 
     According to initial calculations  in the course of five hundred
thousand years Solaris was supposed to move to within half an astro 
nomical unit of its red sun  then after another million years fall into
its burning maw 
     But only ten or twenty years later it became apparent that the
planets orbit was not showing the expected changes  exactly as if it
were as regular as the courses of planets in our own Solar System 
     The observations and calculations were now repeated  this time
with the utmost exactness  and they revealed only what was already
known  that Solaris possessed an unstable orbit 
     From one of several hundred planets discovered yearly and added
into the great databases with a few notes concerning the fundamentals
of their motion  Solaris advanced to the rank of a body worthy of
special attention 
     As a consequence  four years after this discovery it was orbited
by the Ottenskjold expedition  which studied it from the Laocoon
and two accompanying auxiliary ships  This expedition constituted a
makeshift  improvised reconnaissance  the more so because it lacked
the capability to make a landing  It launched into equatorial and
polar orbit a number of unmanned observer satellites whose main
task was to take measurements of gravitational potentials  Further 
more  it investigated the surface of the planet  which was almost in
its entirety covered by ocean  and the few plateaus rising above it 
Their combined area was less than that of Europe  though Solaris
was twenty percent larger than Earth in diameter  Those scraps of
rocky  desert like land  scattered irregularly across the planet  were
mostly found in the southern hemisphere  Studies were also con 
ducted on the atmosphere  which contained no oxygen  and highly
detailed measurements were taken of the density of the planet  as
well as its albedo and other astronomical indicators  As expected  no
life forms were found either on the land or in the ocean 
     Over the following ten years Solaris  now the center of attention
of all observatories in the area  demonstrated a remarkable tendency
to maintain what was beyond any doubt a gravitationally unstable
orbit  For a while there was a hint of scandal in the matter  since
 in the interests of science  attempts were made to blame the results
of these observations either on certain people  or on the instruments
they employed 
     A shortage of funding delayed the dispatch of a proper expedition
to Solaris for three more years  till the moment when Shannahan 
having assembled a crew  managed to secure three C tonnage cos 
modrome class vessels from the Institute  A year and a half before
the arrival of the expedition  which set off from the Alpha Aquarii re 
gion  a second exploratory fleet put an unmanned Satelloid  Luna 247 
in solar orbit on behalf of the Institute  The Satelloid  rebuilt three
times over the space of several decades  has continued to work to this
day  The data it collected definitively confirmed what the Ottenskjold
expedition had observed concerning the active nature of the oceans
movements 
     One of Shannahans ships remained at a high orbit while the other
two made the necessary preparations and landed on a rocky stretch of
ground that occupied about six hundred square miles at Solariss south
pole  The expedition wrapped up its work after eighteen months  it
went well  except for one accident caused by an equipment malfunc 
tion  The crew  however  divided into two mutually opposing camps 
The object of their disagreement was the ocean  On the basis of their
analyses it had been designated an organic formation  at that time 
no one dared say it was alive   Yet while the biologists saw it as
a primitive being something like an immense syncytium  in other
words a single  monstrously grown  fluid cell  even though they called
it a  prebiological form   that extended across the entire globe in a
jelly like covering whose depth reached several miles in places the
astronomers and physicists  on the other hand  claimed it must be a
highly organized structure  perhaps exceeding terrestrial organisms in
its complexity  since it was capable of actively influencing the orbit of
its plane   for no other cause had been discovered that might explain
Solariss behavior  In addition  planetary physicists had uncovered a
relationship between certain processes in the plasmic ocean and local
measurements of gravitational potential  which changed depending on
the oceans  metabolic rate  
     In this way it was physicists  not biologists  who proposed the
paradoxical formulation  plasmic machine  to refer to a formation that
in our sense might be devoid of life  but was capable of undertaking
purposive actions on a scale that  let us add at once  was astronomical 
     In this dispute  which in the space of weeks sucked in every
leading authority like a whirlwind  the Gamov Shapley hypothesis was
brought into question for the first time in eighty years 
     For a period efforts were made to defend it by asserting that the
ocean had nothing to do with life  that it wasnt even a  parabiological 
or  pre biological  formation  but a geological entity  no doubt of
an unusual kind  but whose only capability was to preserve Solariss
orbit through changes in gravitational pull  reference was made to Le
Chateliers principle  
     To counter this conservatism there arose suggestions such as the
Civita Vitty hypothesis  one of the better constructed  claiming that
the ocean was the product of a dialectical development  starting from
its original form  that of a proto ocean  a solution of sluggishly inter 
acting chemical substances  under the pressure of conditions  mean 
ing the orbital changes that threatened its existence   without passing
through all the terrestrial stages of development   that is to say 
the emergence of protozoa and metazoa  plant and animal evolu 
tion  Without developing a nervous system  it had been able to jump
directly to the phase of a  homeostatic ocean   Put simply  unlike ter 
restrial organisms it did not adapt to its surroundings over the course
of hundreds of millions of years  so as only then to produce a rational
species  but it had gained control over its environment from the start 
     This was highly original  except that it was still the case no one
knew how a syrupy jelly could stabilize the orbit of a celestial body 
For almost a century there had existed devices that created artifi 
cial force fields and gravitational fields gravitors but no one could
even imagine how the effects a gravitor achieves through a complex
series of nuclear reactions and extremely high temperatures could be
accomplished by an amorphous ooze  In the newspapers which in
those days  to the delight of their readers and the despair of scien 
tists  reveled in the most indiscriminate conjectures concerning the
 enigma of Solaris  there were claims that the planetary ocean was
a distant relative of earths electric eel 
      When the problem was at least in some measure cleared up  it
transpired that as was so often the case with Solaris  one mystery had
been replaced with another that was perhaps even more puzzling 
      Research revealed that the ocean did not operate at all like our
gravitors  which  of course  would have been impossible   but that it
was capable of directly modeling space time specifications  which led
among other things to variations in the measurement of time at one
and the same meridian on Solaris  In this way the ocean not only
in a certain sense knew the Einstein Boeve hypothesis  but  unlike us
humans  was even able to make use of its consequences 
      When this emerged  one of the most tempestuous storms of our
century broke out in the scientific world  Some of the most venerable
theories  universally regarded as correct  collapsed in ruins  the most
heretical articles began to appear in the scientific literature  and the
 brilliant ocean  versus  gravitational jelly  debate set every mind on
fire 
      All this happened a good fifteen or so years before I was born 
When I was at school  thanks to facts discovered later  Solaris was
widely regarded as a planet endowed with life but with only a single
inhabitant     
      The second volume of Hughes and Eugel  which I was still ab 
stractedly thumbing through  opened with a taxonomy that was as
original as it was amusing  A classification table showed the follow 
ing 
      Type  Polytheria
      Order  Syncytialia
      Class  Metamorpha 
      It was as if we knew goodness knows how many specimens 
whereas in reality there was still only one  which admittedly weighted
seventeen billion tons 
      I flipped past colored diagrams and graphs  analyses and spectro 
graphs setting out the class and tempo of basic metabolism and its
chemical reactions  The deeper I immersed myself in the bulky tome 
the more mathematics appeared on its chalk white pages  It might
have seemed that our knowledge of this representative of the class
of Metamorpha  which lay swathed in the darkness of its four hour
night a thousand or so feet below the steel bed of the Station  was
complete 
    In reality  however  not everyone agreed that this was a  being  
quite aside from the question of whether an ocean could be called
rational  I plonked the big book back on the shelf and took down
the next volume  It was divided into two parts  The first constituted
a summary of the results of all the innumerable experiments aimed
at making contact with the ocean  As I remember only too well 
this contact was the source of endless anecdotes  witticisms  and
jokes when I was in school  medieval scholastics seemed a model
of clarity compared with the jungle that this matter gave rise to 
The second part of the volume  comprising almost thirteen hundred
pages  contained nothing but a bibliography  There would not have
been space in the room I was in for all the original literature on the
topic 
    The first attempts at contact employed special electronic devices
that transformed stimuli sent in both directions  The ocean played an
active part in the design of the devices   though all this happened
in complete darkness  What does it mean to say it  played an ac 
tive part   It modified certain components of the equipment lowered
into it  as a result of which the discharges it registered would change 
and the devices would record a multitude of signals that were like
fragments of some vast advanced analysis  But what did it all mean 
Perhaps these data captured a temporary state of excitation of the
ocean  Perhaps they were impulses that gave rise to its immense
creations  somewhere thousands of miles from the researchers  Per 
haps they were expressions of the oceans eternal truths  converted
into inscrutable electronic formulations  Perhaps they were its works
of art  Who could know  since it was never possible to produce the
same reaction to a stimulus twice  Since one time the response would
be an explosion of impulses that almost blew the apparatus up  the
next time profound silence  Since no experiment could ever be repli 
cated  It always seemed as if we were on the brink of deciphering this
constantly accumulating sea of readings  it was for this purpose that
electronic brains were constructed with the ability to process more
information than had ever been required by any problem before now 
And  in fact  certain results were obtained  The ocean a source of
electrical  magnetic  and gravitational impulses spoke as it were in
the language of mathematics  certain sequences of its electrical dis 
charges could be classified by drawing on the most abstract branches
of terrestrial analysis and of set theory  they contained homologues
of structures known from the area of physics that is concerned with
the mutual relationship between energy and matter  finite and infi 
nite magnitude  particles and fields  All this led scientists to believe
they were dealing with a thinking monster  that it was some kind
of protoplasmic sea cum brain grown so vast it covered an entire
planet  which passed time engrossed in theoretical reflections on an
inconceivable scale concerning the nature of the universe  and that
what the instruments captured were no more than tiny  accidentally
overheard snippets of a stupendous monologue  utterly beyond our
comprehension  that was endlessly being performed in its depths 
     So much for the mathematicians  These hypotheses were re 
garded by some as an underestimation of human capability  as an
obeisance toward something we didnt yet comprehend  but which
could be understood as a resurrection of the old doctrine of ignora 
mus et ignorabimus  we do not know and will not know   Others
saw these as harmful  sterile fairy stories  and claimed the math 
ematicians hypotheses revealed a latter day mythology that saw an
immense brain whether electronic or plasmic as the highest goal
of being  the sum total of existence 
     While others yet      but scientists and opinions were legion 
Besides  all the attempts at  establishing contact  were nothing com 
pared to other branches of solaristics  in which specializations grew
so advanced a cybernetician was barely able to communicate with a
symmetriadologist  Veubeke  who at the time  during my studies  was
director of the Institute  once jokingly asked   How can you commu 
nicate with the ocean if you cant communicate with each other   His
jibe contained much truth 
     For it wasnt by accident that the ocean had been classed as a
Metamorpha  Its undulating surface was capable of giving rise to the
most diverse formations that bore no resemblance to anything terres 
trial  on top of which the purpose adaptive  cognitive  or whatever 
of those often violent eruptions of plasmic  creativity  remained a
total mystery 
    Returning the volume to the shelf it was so heavy I had to lift
it with both hands I thought to myself that what we know about
Solaris  all the knowledge that filled this library  was useless ballast 
a mere quagmire of facts  and that we were in the same position as
when wed started to gather this information seventy eight years ago 
in fact  the situation was a lot worse  since all the labors of those
years had proved to be in vain 
    That which we knew in detail contained nothing but contradic 
tions  The ocean did not employ machines or construct them  though
in certain circumstances it seemed capable of doing so  since it copied
components of some of the devices lowered into it  But it did so only
in the first two years of the exploratory research  after that  with
boundless patience it ignored repeated attempts  as if it had lost all
interest in our instruments and artifacts  and thus  it seemed  in us  
To continue with our  negative knowledge   it did not possess a ner 
vous system  or cells  or any structure resembling protein  It didnt
always respond to stimuli  even the most powerful  for instance  it
completely  ignored  the disaster involving the auxiliary rocket ship
of Gieses second expedition  which plummeted from a height of two
hundred miles to the surface of the planet  destroying plasma for a
mile and a half around when its atomic piles exploded  
    In scientific circles the  case of Solaris  gradually began to sound
like a lost cause  especially among the academic leadership of the
Institute  where in recent years voices had been raised calling for cuts
in future research funding  No one yet dared suggest closing down the
Station completely  this would be too overt an admission of failure 
Though some  at least privately  said that all we needed was a strategy
for as  honorable  a retreat as possible from the  Solaris affair  
    But for many  especially young people  this  affair  eventually be 
came something of a touchstone of ones own worth   In essence  
they would say   the stakes are higher than exploring the civiliza 
tion of Solaris  this is about us ourselves  about the limits of human
cognition  
    For some time one popular view  eagerly disseminated by the
press  was that the thinking ocean covering the whole of Solaris was a
gigantic brain more advanced by millions of years than our own civi 
lization  that it was some kind of  cosmic yogi   a sage  omniscience
incarnate  which had long ago grasped the futility of all action and
for this reason was maintaining a categorical silence towards us  This
was simply untrue  because the living ocean certainly does act its
just that it does so according to notions other than those of humans 
it doesnt build cities or bridges  or flying machines  it doesnt try to
conquer space or cross it  something defenders of human superiority
insisted on seeing as an invaluable trump card for us   Instead  it
occupies itself with thousand fold transformations  ontological au 
tometamorphosis   there was no lack of learned terminology in the
literature on Solaris    Since  on the other hand  anyone plunging
stubbornly into all this literature cannot resist the impression that
though he encounters fragments of perhaps brilliant intellectual con 
structions  these fragments are mixed indiscriminately with the prod 
ucts of utter foolishness bordering on insanity  as an antithesis to the
concept of the  oceanic yogi  there arose the idea of the  oceanic
idiot  
     These hypotheses resuscitated one of the most ancient of philo 
sophical problems the relationship between matter and conscious 
ness  It took a fair amount of courage to lead the way  like du Haart 
in attributing consciousness to the ocean  This problem  which the
methodologists over hastily classified as metaphysical  smoldered be 
neath virtually every discussion and dispute  Was thinking without
consciousness possible  Yet could the processes that took place in the
ocean be regarded as thought  Is a mountain a very large rock  Is a
planet a huge mountain  These terms can be used  but the new scale
of magnitude brings with it new regularities and new phenomena 
     This problem became a squaring of the circle for our times  Every
independent thinker strove to make his own contribution to the trea 
sury of solaristics  Theories multiplied  They claimed we were dealing
with the result of a degeneration or regression that had set in after
the period of the oceans  intellectual splendor   or that the ocean
was in fact a neoplasmic glioma which  having come into existence
within the bodies of former inhabitants of the planet  had consumed
them all and swallowed them up  fusing the remains together in the
form of an everlasting  self rejuvenating  supracellular element 
     In the white glow of neon lamps that was reminiscent of terrestrial
light I removed the instruments and books from the table and  spread 
ing a map of Solaris on the plastic surface  I leaned over it  my hands
resting on the metal trim  The living ocean had its shallows and its
trenches  while its islands were coated with a deposit of weathered
minerals that showed they had once constituted its bottom  Did it
also regulate the rise and fall of the rock formations immersed in its
utterly dark bosom  I gazed at the massive hemispheres on the map 
colored in various shades of purple and pale blue  I felt  as countless
times before in my life  a sense of wonder just as thrilling as the first
time  when as a boy I had learned at school about the existence of
Solaris 
     I dont know how it came about that my surroundings including
the lurking mystery of Gibarians death  even my own unknown future 
all suddenly seemed unimportant  and I thought about nothing what 
soever as I pored over the map  which any human would have found
overwhelming 
     The various areas of the living formation were named after scien 
tists who had dedicated their lives to exploring them  I was studying
the Thexall gliamassif that flowed around the equatorial islands  when
I felt someones eyes on me 
     I was still standing over the map  but I no longer saw it  it was
as if I were paralyzed  The door was straight in front of me  it was
barricaded with crates  plus Id pushed a locker against them  Must
have been an automat  I thought to myself  though there hadnt been
any in the room before  and none could have come in without my
noticing  The skin on my back and the nape of my neck began to
tingle  the feeling of a hard  motionless gaze was becoming unbear 
able  I didnt realize that as I shrank my head into my shoulders I was
leaning more and more heavily on the table  in the end it began to
move slowly across the floor  and it was this movement that seemed
to free me  I turned around abruptly 
     The room was empty  In front of me there was only the gaping
black of the bay window  The sensation lingered  The darkness was
looking at me  amorphous  immense  eyeless  devoid of limits  The
gloom outside was unbrightened by even a single star  I drew the
lightproof drapes  Id not even been a whole hour at the Station
and I was already starting to understand why incidents of paranoia
had occurred here  I connected it instinctively with Gibarians death 
Knowing him  Id thought till now that nothing could have disturbed
his mind  I was no longer so sure 
     I stood in the middle of the room next to the table  My breathing
grew calmer  I could feel the sweat that had broken out on my
forehead cooling  What had I been thinking about a moment ago 
Thats right automats  The fact that Id not seen a single one in the
corridor or in the cabins was very strange  Where had they all gone 
The only one Id encountered at a distance had belonged to the
mechanized service at the docking bay  What about the others 
     I glanced at my watch  It was just about time to go and see Snaut 
     I left the cabin  The corridor was rather dimly lit by fluorescent
lighting strips mounted on the ceiling  I passed two doors and came
to the one that bore Gibarians name  For a long time I stood in
front of it  The Station was filled with silence  I took hold of the
door handle  The truth was  I really didnt want to go in  The handle
moved downwards  the door cracked open an inch or so  there was a
gap that for a moment was black  then the light came on  Now I could
be seen by anyone walking along the corridor  I quickly crossed the
threshold and closed the door behind me  quietly and firmly  Then I
turned around 
     I stood with my back almost touching the door  The cabin was
bigger than mine  it also had a panoramic window  which was three 
fourths covered by a net curtain decorated with small blue and pink
flowers that was clearly not a Station fitting but had been brought
from Earth  The walls were lined with bookshelves and cabinets  both
painted with a very pale green enamel that had a silvery sheen  Their
contents had been tipped onto the floor in piles  and lay heaped
among the upright chairs and armchairs  Right in front of me the way
was barred by two tables on wheels that were tipped over and par 
tially buried in mounds of journals that were spilling from damaged
binders  Books with pages flapping open were drenched in fluids from
broken flasks and bottles with fitted corks that mostly were made of
such thick glass that simply being dropped on the floor  even from a
considerable height  would not have been enough to smash them  By
the window was an overturned desk with a broken adjustable lamp 
a stool lay in front of it  two of its legs thrust among the half open
drawers  There was a veritable flood of papers  hand written sheets 
and other documents spilling across the entire floor  I recognized
Gibarians handwriting and bent down  As I picked up loose sheets
of notepaper I noticed that my arm was casting not one shadow as it
had till now  but two 
    I turned around  As if it had been set alight from the top  the
pink curtain was burning with a vivid line of fierce blue fire that
was widening with every moment  I tugged the fabric aside  and
my eyes were struck by a terrifying blaze  It occupied a third of
the horizon  A tangle of weirdly elongated shadows ran across the
indentations of the waves toward the Station  It was the dawn  In
the zone where the Station was located  after an hour long night  the
planets second  blue sun rose into the sky  The automatic switch
turned off the ceiling lights as I went back to the scattered papers 
I found a concise outline of an experiment that had been prepared
three weeks before Gibarian had planned to subject the plasma to
extremely hard X radiation  From the text I gathered the description
was meant for Sartorius  who was to set up the experiment  what I
had in my hand was a copy  The white sheets of paper were starting
to dazzle me  The day that was beginning was different from the
preceding one  Beneath the orange sky of the cooling sun the ocean 
ink black with bloody flecks  was almost always covered with a dirty
pink mist that fused sky  clouds  and waves together  Now all this had
disappeared  Even filtered by the pink fabric  the light glowed like the
burner of a powerful halogen lamp  It made the suntan on my arms
look almost gray  The whole room was transformed  Everything that
had been red turned brown and faded to the color of liver  whereas
the color of white  green  and yellow objects was so intensified they
looked as if they were emitting their own glow  I squinted through
the crack in the curtains  The sky was a white sea of fire  beneath
which what looked like molten metal was twitching and trembling  I
squeezed my eyes shut at the red circles that were filling my field of
vision  On the shelf of the washbasin  the edge of which was cracked 
I found a pair of sunglasses and put them on  they covered almost
half of my face  The curtain covering the window was now flaring
like a sodium flame  I went on reading  picking up sheets of paper
from the floor and stacking them on the one small table still standing 
Parts of the text were missing 
     These were reports of experiments already conducted  From them
I learned that the ocean had been subjected to radiation for four days 
at a point located fourteen hundred miles northeast of the Station  All
this shocked me  since the use of X rays had been banned by a UN
convention because of their lethal effect  and I was quite sure no
one had sought permission on Earth for these studies  At a certain
moment I raised my head and in the mirror of an open locker I
caught sight of my own reflection  a deathly pale face in dark glasses 
The room looked extraordinary  burning white and light blue  But a
few minutes later there was an extended grinding noise and hermetic
blinds came down outside the windows  The room darkened  then
the artificial lighting came back on  now strangely wan  The place
heated up  till at one point the steady hum from the air conditioning
conduits turned into a strained whine  The cooling system of the
Station was working at full blast  Despite this  the lifeless heat kept
intensifying 
     I heard footsteps  Someone was coming down the corridor  In a
couple of soundless strides I was at the door  The steps slowed and
stopped  Whoever it was  was standing outside the door  The handle
moved slightly  Without thinking  I grabbed it from my side and held
on  The pressure didnt increase  but neither did it ease off  The
person on the other side was being as silent as me  as if taken aback 
For a good while we both held onto the handle  Then it jumped back
up suddenly in my hand  It had been released  and a rustling sound
let me know that the other person was walking away  I stood for a
moment longer  listening intently  but nothing could be heard
