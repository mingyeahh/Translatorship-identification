In the middle of the night I was woken by a light  I propped myself
up on my elbow  covering my eyes with my other hand  Harey was
wrapped in the bedsheet  she was sitting at the foot of the bed 
hunched over  her hair falling across her face  Her shoulders were
shaking  She was crying soundlessly 
      Harey  
     She curled up even more 
      Whats wrong  Harey      
     I sat up on the bed  still not entirely awake  slowly disengaging
from the nightmare that had been stifling me a moment ago  The girl
was trembling  I put my arms around her  She pushed me away with
her elbow and hid her face 
      Darling  
      Dont say that  
      Harey  for goodness sake  what is it  
     I saw her quivering  tear stained face  Big childlike teardrops were
rolling down her cheeks  they glistened in the dimple on her chin and
fell onto the sheet 
      You dont want me  
      Where did you get that idea  
      I heard  
     I could feel my whole face stiffening 
      What did you hear  You misunderstood  it was only      
     No  No  You were saying it isnt me  That I should go away  I
would  God I would  but I cant  I dont know what it is  I wanted to
and I cant  Im so  Im so bad  
     Come on  kid  
    I snatched her up  pulled her to myself as hard as I could  every 
thing was falling apart  I kissed her hands  her wet salty fingers  I
repeated entreaties  oaths  I apologized  I said it was a stupid nasty
dream  She gradually calmed down  She stopped crying  Her eyes
were huge  somnambulistic  They dried  She turned her head away 
     No   she said   dont say all that  theres no need  Youre not the
same towards me either      
     Im not  
    It came out like a groan 
     Thats right  You dont want me  I felt it the whole time  I
pretended not to see it  I thought I was maybe just imagining it or
something  But no  Youre behaving      differently  You dont take me
seriously  It was a dream  thats true  but you were dreaming me  You
called me by my name  You were disgusted  Why  Why   
    I knelt in front of her and put my arms around her knees 
     Come on now  kid  
     I dont want you to talk like that  I dont want it  you hear  Im
not a kid  Im      
    She burst out sobbing and fell face down on the bed  I stood up 
Cool air blew from the air vents with a faint rustle  I was cold  I
threw on a bath robe  sat on the bed and touched her shoulder 
     Harey  listen to me  I want to tell you something  I want to tell
you the truth      
    She sat up  gently leaning her weight on her hands  I could see
the pulse beating beneath the thin skin on her neck  My face went
numb again and I felt as cold as if Id been standing on ice  My head
was completely empty 
     The truth   she said   Cross your heart  
    I didnt answer right away  I had to overcome a constriction in my
throat  That was our old phrase  When it was uttered  neither of us
dared lie  nor even remain silent on whatever it was about  There was
a time we tormented one another with excessive honesty in the naive
belief it would save us 
      Cross my heart   I said solemnly   Harey      
     She waited 
      Youve changed too  We all change  But that wasnt what I
wanted to say  It really looks as if      for a reason neither of us fully
understands      youre not able to be apart from me  But thats not
such a bad thing  because with you too  Im not able to      
      Kris  
     I picked her up  wrapped in the sheet  A corner of it  wet with
tears  fell on my shoulder  I walked around the cabin  rocking her 
She stroked my face 
      No  You havent changed  Its me   she whispered in my ear 
 Theres something wrong with me  Maybe that  
     She was staring at the dark empty rectangle where the broken
door had been  Id taken what was left of it to the depository the
previous evening  Ill need to put a new one up  I thought to myself 
I laid her on the bed 
      Do you even sleep at all   I asked  standing over her with my
arms dangling 
      I dont know  
      What do you mean  you dont know  Think about it  darling  
      I dont think its real sleep  Maybe Im sick  I lie here and think 
and you know      
     She shuddered 
      What is it   I asked in a whisper  knowing my voice might fail
me 
      Theyre really strange thoughts  I dont know where they come
from  
      Like what for example  
     I have to stay calm  I thought to myself  whatever I hear  and I
steeled myself for her words as if for a powerful blow 
     She shook her head  at a loss 
      Its just kind of      all around      
      I dont follow        
     As if it werent just inside me  but further away  kind of  I cant
explain  There arent words to express it      
     Its probably dreams   I said in an offhand way  and breathed
a sigh of relief   Now lets turn off the light and not worry about
anything till morning  and if we feel like it  in the morning well look
for some new worries  OK  
    She reached out for the switch and darkness fell  I lay down on
the cold bedding and felt the warmth of her breath drawing closer 
    I put my arm around her 
     Tighter   she whispered  Then after a long while   Kris  
     What  
     I love you  
    I felt like screaming 
    The dawn was red  The huge disk of the sun hung low over
the horizon  There was a letter on the threshold  I tore open the
envelope  Harey was in the bathroom  I could hear her humming to
herself  From time to time she popped her head around the door  her
hair all wet  I went up to the window and read 

      Kelvin  were gotten bogged down  Sartorius is arguing for
      vigorous steps  He believes hell be able to destabilize the
      neutrino systems  For his experiments he needs a certain
      amount of plasma as initial G matter  Hes proposing that
      you go on a reconnaissance and gather some plasma in a
      container  Do whatever you think right  but let us know
      your decision  I have no opinion either way  I dont think
      I have anything at all anymore  Id prefer you to do it  but
      only so we can move forward  or at least look as if we are 
      Otherwise theres nothing left but to envy G 
      Rat
      PS Dont come to the radio station  That you can still do for
      me  Best of all is to telephone 

    My heart sank as I read the letter  I looked it over carefully one
more time  tore it up and threw the scraps into the sink  Then I
started looking for a space suit for Harey  That alone was awful 
It was exactly like the last time  But she knew nothing about it 
otherwise she wouldnt have been so pleased when I told her I had to
go on a short reconnaissance outside the Station and Id like her to
come along  We ate breakfast in the small galley  during which Harey
barely swallowed a few mouthfuls  and went to the library 
    I wanted to look over the literature on field problems and neutrino
systems before I did what Sartorius wanted  I didnt know how I was
going to go about it  but Id decided to keep an eye on what he was
doing  It had occurred to me that this as yet nonexistent neutrino
annihilator could liberate Snaut and Sartorius  while I waited out the
operation with Harey somewhere on the outside in an aircraft for
example  For some time I pored over the electronic catalogue  asking
it questions to which it responded either by spitting out a slip of paper
that read laconically  not in bibliography   or inviting me into such a
jungle of specialized research in physics that I didnt know where to
begin  For some reason I had an urge to remain in that large circular
room with its smooth walls covered in a checkerwork of drawers with
their multitudes of microfilms and electronic records  The library was
located in the very center of the Station  as such it had no windows
and was the most isolated place inside the steel shell  Who knows if
that wasnt the reason I felt so good there  despite the absolute failure
of my search  I wandered about the large space till finally I came to a
stop in front of a huge bookcase  reaching up to the ceiling and filled
with books  It wasnt so much an indulgence  and a very dubious
one at that  as a respectful memorial to the pioneers of solaristic
exploration  the shelves  on which there were perhaps six hundred
volumes  contained all the classics of the discipline  starting with
Gieses already mostly outdated nine volume monograph  I took out
the tomes  so heavy they made my hand droop  and flipped through
them idly as I perched on the arm of a chair  Harey also found
herself a book I read a few lines of it over her shoulder  It was
one of the few books that had belonged to the first expedition  and
had probably been owned by Giese himself The Interplanetary Chef 
I didnt say anything  seeing the attentiveness with which Harey was
studying recipes adapted for the austere conditions of space travel 
and I returned to the venerable volume I had on my lap  Ten Years of
Research on Solaris had appeared in the  Solariana  series as numbers
four through thirteen  while the most recent additions to the series
were in the four digits 
     Giese had not been especially inspired  but such a quality can only
hinder a scholar of Solaris it may well be that imagination and the
ability to formulate rapid hypotheses is nowhere more harmful  After
all  on that planet anything is possible  Far fetched descriptions of
configurations formed by the plasma are in all likelihood true  though
usually unconfirmable  since the ocean rarely repeats its evolutions 
Those observing them for the first time are staggered above all by
their outlandishness and their vast scope  If theyd taken place on
a small scale  in some swamp  theyd probably be written off as a
freak of nature  a manifestation of randomness and the blind play
of forces  The fact that geniuses and mediocre minds are equally at
a loss when faced with the inexhaustible variety of forms of Solaris
is an additional hindrance in dealing with the marvels of the living
ocean  Giese  though  was neither the one nor the other  He was sim 
ply a pedantic classifier  one of those whose outer calm concealed an
unflagging passion that consumed his whole life  As long as he was
able  here lied exclusively on the language of description  when words
failed him he managed by creating new words  often infelicitous ones
that did not match the phenomena they were intended to describe 
When alls said and done  though  no terms can convey what goes on
on Solaris  Its  dendromountains   its  extensors    megamushrooms  
 mimoids    symmetriads and  asymmetriads   its  vertebrids  and
 rapidos  sound terribly artificial  but they do give some idea of Solaris
even to those whove seen nothing but a few blurry photographs and
poor quality films  Of course  even this conscientious classifier was
guilty of rash moments  Humans are constantly coming up with hy 
potheses  even when theyre being cautious  and even though theyre
quite unaware of it  Giese believed that extensors constituted a root
form  and he compared them to greatly magnified and heightened
versions of tidal waves in terrestrial oceans  Besides  anyone whos
immersed himself in the first edition of the work knows that he orig 
inally named them precisely  tides  led by a geocentrism that would
be amusing if it werent for his helplessness  For if comparisons with
Earth really do have to be employed these are formations larger in
magnitude than Colorados Grand Canyon  modeled in a substance
that on the outside has the consistency of jelly and foam  though the
foam hardens into vast  brittle garlands  into tracery with immense
holes  while some scientists have seen it as  skeletal excrescences   
Within  it turns into an ever firmer substance  like a flexed muscle  but
one that quickly  at a depth of fifty feet or so  grows harder than rock 
though it retains its elasticity  Extending for several miles between
walls that stretch like membranes over the monsters back and cling
to its huge  skeleton  is the actual extensor  a seemingly independent
formation  like a colossal python that has swallowed an entire moun 
tain chain and is now digesting it in silence  from time to time setting
its body in slow  shuddering  fishlike contractions  But this is only
what the extensor looks like from above  from the cabin of an aircraft 
When you get close enough to it that the walls of the ravine rise
hundreds of yards above the plane  the pythons torso turns out to be
a moving expanse that stretches all the way to the horizon and is so
dizzying it takes on the look of a passively bulging cylinder  The first
impression is of a whirl of slick gray green slime whose layers throw
off powerful glints of sunlight  but when the craft hovers right over
the surface  at such moments the edges of the ravine in which the
extensor is concealed are like heights on either side of a geological
depression   it can be seen that the motions are much more complex 
They possess their own concentric rotations  darker streams intersect 
and at times the outer mantle becomes a mirrored surface reflecting
clouds and sky and shot through with loud explosive eruptions of its
half fluid  half gaseous center  It slowly becomes clear that right be 
low you is the central point of the forces holding up the parted sides
that soar high into the sky and are composed of sluggishly crystalizing
jelly  but what is evident to the eye is not so readily accepted by sci 
ence  For years and years there were furious discussions about what
was actually happening within an extensor  millions of which litter the
vastnesses of the living ocean  It was thought they were some sort
of organs of the monster  in which it metabolizes matter or which
contain processes of breathing  the transfer of nutrition  and other
things now known only to dusty library shelves  Every hypothesis was
eventually disproved by a thousand painstaking and often perilous
experiments  And all this concerned only the extensors  when it came
down to it the simplest and most enduring form  for their existence
lasts several weeks something quite exceptional here 
    One highly complex  capricious form that stirs the fiercest resis 
tance in the viewer a resistance that is  of course  instinctive is the
mimoids  It can be said without exaggeration that Giese fell in love
with them  and to the very end he devoted himself to exploring them 
describing them  and puzzling out their essence  With the name he
strove to convey what for humans is most curious about them  a
tendency to imitate the forms around them  whether close or remote 
    On a certain day  deep below the surface of the ocean there ap 
pears the darkening shape of a broad flat circle that has ragged sides
and is as if coated with tar  After twelve or fifteen hours it becomes
layered  is more and more visibly segmented  and at the same time
thrusts upwards toward the surface  The observer could swear that
beneath him a violent struggle is taking place  because endless series
of synchronous circular waves flow in from all around like shrinking
mouths  like living  muscled  closing craters  they pile up on top of
the swaying blackish phantom lying in the depths and  first rising ver 
tically  they plummet downwards  Each such plunge of hundreds of
thousands of tons is accompanied by a sticky  almost smacking rum 
ble that goes on for several seconds  because here everything happens
on a monstrous scale  The dark formation is forced downwards  each
successive impact seems to flatten and spread it  From individual lay 
ers  which droop like wet wings  elongated clusters break loose  they
narrow into long necklaces  fuse together and drift upwards  drawing
with them the fragmented mother disk  which has as it were adhered
to them  in the meantime successive rings of waves are continuing
incessantly to descend from above into a huge and ever more dis 
tinctly concave circle  This game can go on for a day  or it can last
a whole month  Sometimes thats the end of it  The conscientious
Giese labeled such a variant an  abortive mimoid  as though  from
who knew where  he possessed the certain knowledge that the ulti 
mate goal of every such upheaval was a  mature mimoid   that is
to say  the colony of polyp like  light skinned excrescences  usually
larger than a terrestrial city  whose destiny is to copy external forms 
    It goes without saying that another solaricist came along  by the
name of Uyvens  who on the contrary determined that this last phase
was a  degenerative  one  a degradation  an atrophy  and that the for 
est of created shapes was an evident manifestation of the branching
formations freeing themselves from the control of the matrix 
     Giese  however who in all his descriptions of other formations
on Solaris proceeded like an ant climbing a frozen waterfall  allowing
nothing to distract him from the regular tread of his dry language 
was in this case so sure of being right that he classified the successive
phases of the mimoids emergence in a sequence of increasing per 
fection 
     Seen from high up  a mimoid looks like a city  but this is an
illusion arising from the need for any sort of analogy with something
familiar  When the sky is clear  all the multistory growths and their
crowning palisades are surrounded by a layer of heated air that makes
the shapes  already hard to determine  look as if they were swaying
and bending  The first cloud crossing the blue  I use this expression
out of habit  because this  blue  is ruddy during the red day and
terrifyingly white during the blue one  brings an immediate response 
An abrupt gemmation begins  a malleable skin  almost completely
separate from the base and swelling out like a cauliflower  is projected
upwards  simultaneously it grows pale  and in a few minutes it offers
a perfect imitation of the puffy cloud  This huge object casts a reddish
shadow  Some of the mimoids peaks seem to pass it on to others 
this movement always takes place in the opposite direction to the
movement of the real cloud  I think Giese would have given his right
arm to know at the very least why this happens  But such  isolated 
creations of the mimoid are nothing in comparison with the elemental
activity it displays when it is  stimulated  by the presence of objects
and shapes appearing above it due to the actions of terrestrial visitors 
     The re creation of forms essentially includes anything to be found
within a radius of up to eight or nine miles  More often than not the
mimoid produces magnified copies  at times it distorts them  creating
caricatures or grotesque simplifications  especially of machines  It
goes without saying that the material is always the same  a rapidly
decoloring mass that  when flung into the air  instead of falling hangs
there  joined by easily broken umbilical cords to the base  across which
it crawls  at the same time contracting  narrowing or expanding as it
fluidly assumes the most complex patterns  Aircraft  grate  or mast
are reproduced with equal rapidity  the mimoid fails to respond only
to people  or to be precise  to any living beings  including plants 
because these too were brought to Solaris for research purposes by
indefatigable scientists  Whereas a mannequin  a human doll  a figure
of a dog or tree made in any material whatsoever is instantly imitated 
     And here  unfortunately  it needs to be said in parentheses that
this  obedience  on the part of the mimoid toward the scientists 
so unusual on Solaris  is sometimes suspended  The most mature
mimoid has its  lazy days  during which it does nothing but pulsate
very slowly  This pulsation  incidentally  is not visible to the eye  its
rhythm  a single beat of the pulse  happens once every two hours 
and stop motion photography was needed to discover it 
     In such circumstances a mimoid  especially an old one  is perfect
for visiting  since both the base disk  fixed deep in the ocean  and the
formations rising from it offer entirely firm support for the feet 
     Of course  its also possible to be inside a mimoid on its  busy 
days  but at such moments visibility is close to zero because of the in 
cessant precipitation of flaky colloidal suspension  the off white color
of powdery snow  which constantly falls from the swollen branches
of the abdomen as it manufactures its imitated forms  In fact these
forms cannot be perceived from close up  due to their mountainous
immensity  In addition  the base of a  working  mimoid grows slimy
from the dense rain  which only hours later hardens into a solid shell
many times lighter than pumice  In the final stages  without the right
equipment its easy to get lost in the labyrinth of bulging stalks that
look a little like retractable columns  a little like semi liquid geysers 
even in full sunlight  since the suns rays cannot penetrate the cover
of  imitative explosions  being thrown up into the atmosphere 
     Observing a mimoid on its happy days  which are  to be precise 
the happy days of the scientist who finds himself close by  can be
an unforgettable experience  They have their  creative frenzy  when
they commence an extraordinary hyper production  At these times
they make either their own variations on external forms  more com 
plex versions of them  or even  formal extensions   and they can
entertain themselves in this way for hours  to the delight of the ab 
stract artist and the despair of the researcher  who strives in vain to
comprehend any of the emerging processes  At times the mimoids
activity includes utterly childlike simplifications  sometimes it engages
in  baroque deviations   at which moments all it creates is marked by
bulging elephantiasis  Old mimoids in particular fabricate shapes that
can induce a hearty chuckle  True  I myself have never been able to
laugh at them  having always been overly awed by the mystery of the
spectacle 
     It goes without saying that in the early years the scientists literally
pounced on mimoids as supposedly perfect centers of the Solarian
ocean  as places where the longed for contact between two civiliza 
tions would take place  Yet it transpired only too quickly that such
contact was out of the question  since everything began and ended
with an imitation of shapes leading nowhere 
     The anthropomorphism and zoomorphism constantly present in
the scientists desperate quests saw the ever newer productions of the
living ocean as  sense organs  or even  limbs   which for some time
scholars such as Maartens or Ekkonai perceived in Gieses vertebrids
and rapidos  Yet these protuberances of the living ocean  sometimes
soaring two miles into the atmosphere  are no more its limbs than an
earthquake is gymnastic exercise for the earths crust 
     The list of forms that occur relatively regularly  and are produced
by the ocean sufficiently often that several dozen or even several hun 
dred can be found on its surface in the course of an average day  runs
to three hundred or so items  The most un human  meaning those
that bear absolutely no resemblance to anything experienced by hu 
mankind on Earth  are according to the Giese school the symmetriads 
Even back then it was well established that the ocean did not behave
aggressively  and one could perish in its plasmic depths only by truly
striving to do so through ones own imprudence or carelessness  nat 
urally I dont include accidents caused by malfunctioning equipment
such as a damaged oxygen tank or cooling apparatus   and that even
the cylindrical rivers of extensors and the monstrous pillars of verte 
brids could be flown through in a airplane or other flying machine
without the slightest danger  The plasma allowed free passage  part 
ing before the foreign body at the equivalent of the speed of sound
in the atmosphere of Solaris  and when forced to  even creating deep
tunnels far beneath the surface of the ocean   The energy it mobilized
at such moments was massive Skriabin calculated that in extreme
cases it could amount to 109 ergs   Symmetriads were investigated
with exceptional caution  constantly drawing back  adopting multiple
safety measures  though  truth be told  these were often bogus   the
names of those who first explored them are known to every child on
Earth 
     The direness of these giants doesnt lie in their appearance  though
that can truly induce nightmares  It rather arises from the fact that
within them nothing is stable or certain  even the laws of physics
are suspended  It was always those studying symmetriads who pro 
claimed most vociferously the thesis that the living ocean was rational 
     Symmetriads arise without warning  Their beginning is a kind of
eruption  About an hour beforehand  the ocean begins to gleam  as if
its been covered with glass over an area of tens of square miles  Other
than this  its fluidity and the rhythm of its waves remain unchanged 
At times a symmetriad emerges where there is a funnel from an
absorbed rapido  but this is not a rule  After an hour or so  the glassy
coating rises upwards in a monstrous bubble that reflects the entire
sky  sun and clouds and the whole horizon  shimmering and glinting 
The lightning play of colors  caused partly by the curvature and partly
by refraction of the light  has no parallel 
     Particularly striking effects of light are produced by symmetriads
that arise during the blue day and immediately before sunset  At
such times it looks as if the planet is giving birth to another one 
doubling its volume with every moment  The moment the globe with
its flaming shimmer bursts from the depths  it splits at its highest
point into vertical sectors  but it isnt disintegrating  This stage  rather
clumsily labeled the  calycate phase   lasts only seconds  The arches
of membranous spans rising into the sky become inverted  link up
in the unseen interior and instantly begin to form something along
the lines of a squat torso within which hundreds of things happen at
once  In the very center  which was first studied by the seventy person
Hamalei expedition  a process of gigantocrystalization and polycrystal 
ization leads to the emergence of an axial supporting pivot sometimes
called a  spine   though I am not a fan of the term  The precipitous
architecture of this central pillar is held up in statu nascendi as it
is being born by vertical columns of a jelly so diluted its almost
watery  bursting endlessly from the mile deep recesses  During this
process the colossus emits a prolonged hollow roar  and is encircled
by a shaft of snowy  coarse celled foam that quakes furiously  There
then follow  moving from the center to the periphery  extraordinarily
complex revolutions of the hardened planes on which the layers of
ductile matter rising from below have accumulated  while at the same
time the deep ocean geysers mentioned above condense and trans 
form into mobile tentacle like columns  clusters of them reach toward
loci of construction that are strictly determined by the dynamics of
the whole  recalling some sort of immense gills of an embryo grow 
ing a thousand times faster than normal  and streaming with pinkish
blood and a green water so dark its almost black  From this moment
the symmetriad begins to manifest its most extraordinary quality  the
modeling or even suspension of laws of physics  Let us begin by say 
ing that no two symmetriads are alike and that the geometry of each
is  as it were  an  invention  of the living ocean  So then  the sym 
metriad produces in its interior things that are often called  instant
machines   though these formations bear no resemblance to machines
constructed by people the term only refers to a certain  mechanical 
purposiveness of operation 
     When the geysers erupting far beneath the ocean surface solidify
or swell into thick walled galleries and corridors that run in every
direction  and the  membranes  form a system of intersecting planes 
overhangs  and ceilings  the symmetriad justifies its name by the fact
that each intricate arrangement of passages  pathways  and inclines
within one of its poles has a faithful copy at the other 
     After twenty or thirty minutes the giant slowly begins to sink 
occasionally first leaning between eight and twelve degrees in the
vertical axis  There are larger and smaller symmetriads  but even the
dwarves rise a good two and a half thousand feet over the horizon
after they begin to submerge  and can be seen from miles away  Its
safest to enter their interior immediately after they reach stability 
since the whole ceases to drop into the ocean  and at the same
time it returns to the perfectly perpendicular  The best point of
entry is the area just below the summit  In this place the relatively
smooth polar  cap  is encircled by an area honeycombed with funnel 
shaped openings to inner chambers and channels  This configuration
constitutes  as a whole  a three dimensional solution to a higher order
equation 
    Its common knowledge that any equation can be expressed in the
figural language of higher geometry  and a solid can be constructed
that is its equivalent  In this understanding  a symmetriad is a relative
of Lobachevskys cones and Riemanns negative curvatures  but a very
distant relative  due to its unimaginable complexity  Occupying an
area of several cubic miles  it constitutes the solution to an entire
mathematical system  this solution  furthermore  is four dimensional 
since certain essential coefficients in the equation are also expressed
in time  that is to say  in the changes brought about by its passing 
    Naturally  the simplest conception was that this was no more and
no less than a  mathematical machine  of the living ocean  a model
created on its own scale for calculations it needed for some unknown
purpose  but this idea  the Fermont Hypothesis  is no longer credited 
It was tempting  to be sure  but the claim that these titanic eruptions 
every tiny particle of which was constantly subject to the complicating
formulas of the overall analysis  were being used by the living ocean
to examine questions of matter  space  existence this notion proved
untenable  Too many phenomena were to be found in the giants
innards that could not be reconciled with such a simple  some said
childishly naive  depiction 
    There was no lack of attempts to come up with an intelligible
model of a symmetriad  a visualization of it  One popular explanation
was offered by Averian  who presented the matter as follows  Imagine
an ancient terrestrial building from Babylonian times  Let it be built
out of a living  responsive  evolving substance  Its design proceeds
fluidly through a series of phases  taking on  as we watch  the forms
of Greek and Roman architecture  Then the columns begin to grow
narrow as stalks  the ceiling loses its weight  it rises  sharpens  the
arches turn into steep parabolas and eventually fold and soar  The
Gothic that has appeared in this way begins to mature and age  it
dissolves into late forms  its former precipitous severity replaced with
eruptions of orgiastic exuberance  Before our eyes Baroque excess
proliferates  and if we continue this sequence   all the time regarding
our changing formation as if it were the successive stages of a living
being   well finally arrive at the architecture of the space center era 
at the same time perhaps getting closer to understanding the nature
of the symmetriad 
    Yet this analogy  however it may be expanded and enriched  in
fact  there were efforts to show it visually using special models and
films   remains at best weak  at worst an evasion  if not a downright
falsehood  for a symmetriad is unlike anything on Earth     
    A human being is capable of taking in very few things at one
time  we see only what is happening in front of us  here and now  Vi 
sualizing a simultaneous multiplicity of processes  however they may
be interconnected  however they may complement one another  is be 
yond us  We experience this even with relatively simple phenomena 
The fate of a single person can mean many things  the fate of several
hundred is hard to encompass  but the history of thousands  millions 
means essentially nothing at all  A symmetriad is millions  no  bil 
lions  to the nth power  it is unimaginability itself  What of it if  in
the recesses of one of its aisles that is a ten fold version of a Kro 
necker space  we stand like ants holding onto the folds of a breathing
vault  that we watch the rise of vast planes grayly opalescent in the
light of our flares  their interpenetration  the softness and infallible
perfection of their resolution  which only lasts a moment  for every 
thing here is fluid the content of this architecture is motion  intent
and purposive  We observe a fragment of the process  the trembling
of a single string in a symphonic orchestra of supergiants  and on
top of that we know we only know  without comprehending that
at the same time  above us and beneath us  in the plunging deep 
beyond the limits of sight and imagination there are multiple  million
fold simultaneous transformations connected to one another like the
notes of musical counterpoint  For this reason someone gave them
the name of geometric symphony  but if this is the case  we are its
unhearing audience 
     Here  in order to truly see anything at all  one would have to draw
back rapidly  retreat to an immense distance  yet in a symmetriad all
is internal  all is propagation  surging avalanches of births  endless
shaping  At the same time each shaped thing is itself in the business
of shaping other things  and no mimosa is as sensitive to a single
touch  to the changes taking place where we stand  as the distant
other pole of the symmetriad  miles away and separated by hundreds
of stories  Here every momentary structure  with a beauty that attains
its fulfillment beyond the limits of sight  is a co creator and conductor
of all the others that occur at the same time  and they in turn have
a modeling influence on it  A symphony very well  but a kind that
writes itself and drowns itself out  Terrible is the end of the sym 
metriad  No one who sees it can resist the impression of witnessing
a tragedy  if not a murder  After two  at the most three hours this
explosive growth  multiplication of itself  self reproduction  never lasts
longer the living ocean goes on the offensive  It looks as follows 
the smooth surface wrinkles over  the surf  calm now and covered
with dried foam  starts to seethe  concentric series of waves rush in
from the horizons  They form the same kind of muscle bound craters
as those that assist at the birth of a mimoid  though these ones are
incomparably huger  The submerged part of the symmetriad is com 
pressed and the colossus rises slowly upwards as if it were about to
be flung from the planet  the upper layers of the oceans glial matter
move into action  they creep higher and higher up the symmetriads
side walls  covering them over  hardening  blocking up the passage 
ways  But all this is nothing in comparison with whats taking place
at the same time within  To begin with  the formative processes the
making of successive architectures pause for a brief moment  then
suddenly accelerate  movements that up till now have been fluid  in 
terpenetrations  foldings  the addition of foundations and ceilings  all
of which has proceeded thus far smoothly and as surely as if it were to
endure for centuries  begins to rush  Theres an overwhelming sense
that faced with imminent danger  the colossus is hurriedly moving
towards some kind of consummation  Yet the greater the speed of the
transformations  the more glaring the terrible  horrific metamorphosis
of the material itself and its dynamics  All the soaring  magically curv 
ing planes soften  grow flaccid  droop  there begin to appear lapses 
unfinished forms  grotesque  misshapen  A gathering roar rises from
the unseen depths  air  expelled as if in death throes and rubbing
against the narrowing channels  wheezing and thundering in the pas 
sageways  stimulates the collapsing ceilings to a wail as if from lifeless
vocal cords or monstrous throats overgrown with stalactites of slime 
and despite the furious movement that has been unleashed it is 
after all  the movement of destruction the spectator is immediately
overcome by a sense of utter deadness  By this point the towering
construction is supported only by the gale howling from the abyss 
passing through it via a thousand shafts  inflating the structure  which
begins to slide downwards  collapse like a plaster statue caught in the
flames  though here and there the last twitchings can still be seen 
incoherent movements disconnected from the rest  blind  ever weaker 
till the huge mass  undermined and exposed to constant attack from
outside  collapses with the slowness of a mountain and vanishes in a
confusion of foam like that which accompanied its titanic appearance 
     And what does all this mean  Yes indeed  what does it mean     
     I remember a school tour visiting the Solaris Institute in Aden
when I was Gibarians assistant  After passing through a side area
of the library  the young people were led into its main room  which
is mostly filled with boxes of microfilms  They contain images of
brief moments from the interior of symmetriads which themselves  of
course  are long gone  There are over ninety thousand of them reels 
that is  not photographs  And then a plump girl of perhaps fifteen  in
glasses  with a resolute and intelligent expression  suddenly asked 
      Whats it all for  
     In the awkward silence that followed  the teacher gave her trou 
blesome charge a stern look  but none of the solaricists accompanying
the group  of whom I was one  could offer an answer  Because sym 
metriads are unique  as are most of the phenomena that take place
in them  Sometimes the air ceases to conduct sound within them 
Sometimes the refraction coefficient increases or decreases  Localized
pulsing  rhythmic changes of gravitation occur  as if the symmetriad
had a beating gravitational heart  Occasionally the scientists gyro 
compasses would start to behave as if theyd gone mad  layers of
intensified ionization would appear then vanish  The list goes on 
Besides  if the mystery of the symmetriads is ever solved  therell still
be the asymmetriads     
    They arise in a similar way  but they have a different end and
nothing can be observed in them except for trembling  glowing  twin 
kling  we know only that they are the seat of dizzyingly rapid pro 
cesses  at the limits of physically possible velocities  also known as
 magnified quantum phenomena   Their mathematical resemblance
to certain models of the atom is  however  so unstable and fleeting
that some consider it a side effect or even something entirely ac 
cidental  They exist a much shorter time than symmetriads only
ten or fifteen minutes and their end is perhaps even more terrible 
because following the hurricane that fills them to bursting with hard 
roaring air  with a hellish swiftness they become filled with a liquid
that eddies beneath a coating of dirty foam  and that floods over ev 
erything  bubbling hideously  after which there follows an explosion
like a volcano of mud erupting  tossing up a disheveled pillar of rem 
nants that for a long time afterwards descend in a macerated rain on
the unquiet surface of the ocean  Some of these pieces  carried on
the wind dry as sticks  yellowing  flat  and for this reason resembling
membranous bones or cartilage can be found drifting on the waves
dozens of miles from the heart of the explosion 
    A separate group comprises formations that detach themselves
completely from the living ocean for a shorter or longer time  They
are much less frequent that the previously mentioned phenomena 
and much harder to observe  The first time fragments of them were
found they were completely misidentified  it transpired much later  as
the dead bodies of beings that dwelled in the ocean  At times they
appear to be fleeing like strange multi winged birds being pursued by
the funnels of rapidos  but this concept  borrowed from Earth  once
again becomes a wall that cannot be broken through  Sometimes 
though only very infrequently  on the rocky shores of islands one can
see groups of flightless creatures like pods of seals  basking in the sun
or lazily crawling to the sea  so as to melt into it 
     In this way everyone remained within the limitations of human 
terrestrial concepts  while first contact     
     Expeditions traveled hundred of miles deep inside symmetriads 
setting up recording equipment and automatic film cameras  the tele 
vision eyes of robot satellites captured the gemmation of mimoids
and extensors  their maturation and decease  Libraries filled  archives
grew  the cost was sometimes high  Seven hundred and eighteen
people died in various disasters  having failed to withdraw in time
from colossuses whose time had come  Of these  one hundred and
six perished in a single catastrophe that was infamous because their
number included Giese himself  by that time an old man of seventy 
when a formation that was a clear example of a symmetriad suddenly
met the end that usually befalls an asymmetriad  Seventy nine of the
victims  wearing armored space suits  along with their apparatus and
machinery  were swallowed up in a matter of seconds by an explosion
of muddy slime whose offshoots struck down twenty seven others pi 
loting aircraft and helicopters above the formation being investigated 
This place  at the intersection of the forty second parallel and the
eighty ninth meridian  is marked on maps as the Eruption of the One
Hundred and Six  But the point exists on maps alone  since in that
place the surface of the ocean is no different than any of its other
regions 
     At that moment  for the first time in the history of research on
Solaris  voices were heard calling for the use of thermonuclear strikes 
It was to be in essence crueler than revenge  it would have meant
the destruction of that which we cannot comprehend  Tsanken  the
second in command of Gieses relief team  who survived only thanks
to an error the relay automat had incorrectly indicated the place
where the others were studying the symmetriad  such that Tsanken
traipsed about all over the ocean and only came to the right place
literally minutes after the explosion  seeing the black mushroom cloud
as he approached at the moment when the decision to attack was
being weighed  threatened he would blow up the Station along with
himself and the other eighteen crew members remaining on it  and
though it was never admitted that this suicidal ultimatum influenced
the vote  it can be assumed such was the case 
     But the times of such large expeditions visiting the planet are
past  The Station itself its construction  supervised from satellites 
was an engineering venture on a scale Earth could have been proud
of  were it not for the fact that the ocean produced out of itself
structures a million times larger in the space of seconds was built
in the form of a disk with a diameter of six hundred and fifty feet 
with four stories in the center and two around the edges  Suspended
between fifteen hundred and five thousand feet above the ocean  
thanks to gravitors driven by annihilation energy  along with all the
equipment usually found on Stations and large Satelloids of other
planets   it was additionally provided with special radar sensors that
at the first change in the oceans smooth surface would initiate extra
power  bringing the steel disk up into the stratosphere the moment a
new living formation showed signs of being born 
     Now the Station was virtually deserted  Since the automats had
been locked away in the cavernous depositories  for reasons still un 
known to me one could wander the corridors without meeting any 
one  like in a drifting wreck whose motors have survived the demise
of its crew 
     As I was setting the ninth volume of Gieses monograph back on
the shelf I had the impression that the steel floor under its covering of
thick foam plastic suddenly trembled beneath my feet  I froze  but the
trembling didnt recur  The library was thoroughly insulated from the
rest of the structure  and tremors could be caused by one thing only 
A rocket had been launched from the Station  This thought brought
me back to reality  I still hadnt fully made up my mind whether to
go on the reconnaissance as Sartorius wanted  By acting as though I
concurred with his plans in full  I could do no more than postpone
the crisis  I was almost certain thered be conflict  because Id decided
to do whatever I could to save Harey  The big question was whether
there was a chance Sartorius might succeed  He had a huge advantage
over me as a physicist he knew the problem ten times better than
I did  while I  paradoxically  could count only on the excellence of
the solutions the ocean deigned to offer us  For the next hour I
pored over microfilms  striving to extract any sense whatsoever from
the sea of hellish mathematics that was the language spoken by the
physics of neutrino processes  To begin with it seemed hopeless  the
more so because there were as many as five extraordinarily difficult
theories of the neutrino field  a clear indication that none of them
was perfect  Yet I managed after all to find something promising  I
was just copying out the formulas when there was a knock 
    I went quickly to the door and cracked it open  blocking the gap
with my body  Snauts face appeared  glistening with perspiration 
The corridor behind him was empty 
     Oh  its you   I said  opening the door further   Come in  
     Yes  its me   he responded  His voice was hoarse  there were bags
under his red eyes  and he was wearing a shiny rubber anti radiation
apron on elastic suspenders  Underneath it I could see the grubby
legs of the same pants he always wore  His eyes ran around the
circular  evenly lit space and came to a stop when he spotted Harey
standing by an armchair at the far end of the library  We exchanged
the briefest of glances  I lowered my eyelids  at which he gave a slight
bow  and I said in a casual tone 
     Harey  this is Dr  Snaut  Snaut  this is      my wife  
     Im      a very rarely seen member of the crew and thats why 
     the pause extended dangerously  Ive not had the opportunity
to make your acquaintance       Harey smiled and put out her hand
which he shook  it seemed to me  with a certain astonishment  He
blinked several times and stood staring at her till I took him by the
arm 
     Excuse me   he said then to Harey   I need a word with you 
Kelvin      
     Of course   I replied with the ease of a man about town  it all
sounded to me like cheap comedy  but there was nothing to be done 
 Harey  darling  dont mind us  Dr  Snaut and I have to talk about our
boring scientific business  
    And I led him at once to some small armchairs on the other side
of the room  Harey dropped into the chair shed been sitting in before 
but she pushed it around in such a way that she could see us when
she raised her eyes from her book 
     What is it   I asked softly 
     I got divorced   he answered just as quietly  though his whisper
had a sibillance about it  At one time I might have laughed at a
story like that and such a conversation opener  but on the Station my
sense of humor had been amputated   Ive lived through years since
yesterday  Kelvin   he added   A good few years  Whats with you  
     Not much   I answered after a moment  because I didnt know
what to say  I liked him  but I sensed that at the present moment
I needed to be on my guard with him  or rather with what he had
come to me about 
     Not much   he replied in the same tone as me   I see  so thats
how things are        
     What do you mean   I said  pretending I didnt understand  He
narrowed his bloodshot eyes and  leaning in so close I could feel the
warmth of his breath on my face  he whispered 
     Were bogged down  Kelvin  I cant get a hold of Sartorius any 
more  all I know is what I wrote you about what he said after that
lovely little conference of ours      
     Hes turned off his visuphone   I asked 
     No  Theres a short circuit at his end  It looks like he did it
deliberately  or maybe        He made a movement with his fist as if
he were smashing something  I looked at him without saying a word 
The left corner of his mouth rose in a disagreeable smile 
     Kelvin  I came here because      
    He didnt finish 
     What do you intend to do  
     You mean the letter         I replied slowly   I can do it  I see
no reason to refuse  Actually thats why Im sitting here  I wanted to
figure out  
     No   he interrupted   I didnt mean that      
     No   I said  feigning surprise   Do tell  
     Its Sartorius   he murmured after a short pause   He thinks hes
found a way      you know  
    He kept his gaze fixed on me  I sat there calmly  striving to make
my expression look indifferent 
     First theres that business with the X rays  What Gibarian was
doing with them  remember  Its possible to modify it somewhat      
     How  
     All they were doing was sending a bundle of rays into the ocean
and modulating their intensity according to different formulas  
     Yes  I know about that  Nilin did it too  And a whole bunch of
others  
     Right  but they used soft radiation  This was the hard stuff  they
packed everything they had into the ocean  the whole nine yards  
     That could have unpleasant consequences   I remarked   Its a
violation of the Convention of the Four  and of UN restrictions  
     Kelvin      Dont act dumb  Thats neither here nor there at this
point  Gibarians dead  
     Oh  so Sartorius is thinking of blaming the whole thing on him  
     I dont know  I havent talked to him about it  Thats not impor 
tant  Sartorius reckons that since guests only appear when we wake
up  it must be extracting the prescription to produce them while were
asleep  It thinks our most important state is sleep  precisely  Thats
why it does what it does  So Sartorius wants to send it our waking
state our conscious thoughts  You follow  
     How  By mail  
     Save the jokes for later  The bundle of rays will be modified with
the brain waves of one of us  
    It all suddenly became clear to me 
     Oh   I said   And that one of us would be me  Right  
     Yes  He was thinking of you  
     Im deeply grateful  
     What do you say  
    I was silent  Without a word he took an unhurried look at Harey
where she sat immersed in her reading  then turned his gaze back to
me  I felt I was turning pale  I couldnt stop myself 
     Well   he said 
    I shrugged 
     All those X ray sermons about the wonderfulness of humankind 
thats all nonsense in my view  Yours  too  Or am I wrong  
     Really  
     Really  
     Very well then   he said and smiled  as if Id granted his wish 
 So youre opposed to this business of Sartoriuss  
     I didnt yet understand what had happened  but from his expres 
sion I realized that hed led me exactly where he wanted to  I didnt
speak what could I have said at that juncture 
      Excellent   he said   Because theres also another project  To
adapt a Roche machine  
      An annihilator        
      Yes  Sartorius has already carried out the preliminary calcula 
tions  Its doable  It wont even require a lot of power  The machine
will run twenty four hours a day or for an unlimited time  to create
an antifield  
      W     wait  How do you envisage that   
      Its very simple  Itll be a neutrino antifield  Ordinary matter
will remain untouched  The only thing to be destroyed will be     
neutrino systems  You understand  
     He gave a satisfied smile  I sat there with my mouth agape 
The smile gradually disappeared from his face  He frowned at me
searchingly and waited 
      So Project Thought  the first one  were rejecting that  Right  And
the second one  Sartorius is working on it already  Were going to call
it Project Freedom  
     I closed my eyes for a moment  Id suddenly made up my mind 
Snaut was not a physicist  Sartorius had turned his visuphone off or
broken it  Very well 
      Id call it rather Project Butchery   I said slowly 
      You were a butcher yourself  Am I not right  Now things will be
quite different  No guests  no G formations nothing  The moment
the materialization appears  itll disintegrate  
      You misunderstand   I replied  shaking my head with a smile
that I hoped looked sufficiently natural   These arent moral scruples 
theyre a survival instinct  I dont want to die  Snaut  
      What        
     He was taken aback  He gave me a suspicious look  From my
pocket I pulled out the crumpled sheet of paper containing the for 
mulas 
      Ive been thinking about it too  Does that surprise you  After
all  I was the first one to propose the neutrino hypothesis  you wont
deny that  So look  an antifield can be built  For ordinary matter its
harmless  That much is true  But at the moment of destabilization 
when the neutrino system begins to disintegrate  the energy of its
bonds will be released as surplus  If we assume ten to the eighth ergs
for every kilogram of rest mass  for one G formation we get between
five and seven times ten to the eighth  Do you know what that means 
The equivalent of a small uranium charge going off inside the Station  
     What are you saying  But      surely Sartorius must have taken
that into consideration      
     Not necessarily   I retorted with a malicious smile   The thing
is  Sartorius belongs to the Frazer and Cajolli school  According to
them  at the moment of disintegration the entire energy of the bonds
is released in the form of light radiation  Thered be just a powerful
flash  maybe not completely safe  but not destructive  But there are
other hypotheses  other theories of the neutrino field  According to
Cayatt  according to Avalov  to Siona  the emission spectrum is much
broader  with the maximum occurring as hard gamma radiation  Its
very nice that Sartorius trusts his masters and their theory  but there
are others  Snaut  And you know what else   I went on  seeing that
my words had made an impression on him   The ocean also needs
to be taken into consideration  If it did what it did  for sure it used
the best possible method  In other words  its activities seem to me
an argument in favor of the other school and against Sartorius  
     Let me see that paper  Kelvin      
    I handed it to him  He peered at it  trying to make sense of my
scribblings 
     Whats that   He pointed with his finger 
    I took the paper back 
     Thats the field transmutation tensor  
     Let me have it      
     What do you need it for   I asked  I knew what hed say 
     I have to show Sartorius  
     As you wish   I replied indifferently   You can take it  The point
is  no one has tested this experimentally  weve never known these
kinds of systems before  He believes in Frazer  I followed Siona in
my calculations  Hell tell you Im not a physicist and that Siona
isnt either  At least not in his estimation  But thats a matter for
discussion  Ive no wish to engage in a debate that could result in my
being vaporized  to the greater glory of Sartorius  You I can convince 
but not him  And Im not going to try  
      So what do you mean to do        Hes working on it   said Snaut
in a toneless voice  He hunched over  all his liveliness was gone  I
didnt know if he trusted me  but I no longer cared 
      What a person does when someones trying to kill him   I replied
quietly 
      Ill try and get in touch with him  Maybe hes planning some
safety measures   murmured Snaut  He raised his eyes to me   Listen 
maybe the first project after all        Hm  Sartorius would agree  For
sure  Its      at least      a shot      
      Do you believe that  
      No   he replied at once   But      how could it hurt  
     I didnt want to agree too readily  since that was what I wanted 
He was becoming my ally in playing for time 
      Ill think about it   I said 
      All right  Im off   he mumbled  getting up  His bones cracked as
he rose from the chair   So youll let us make an encephalogram of
you   he asked  rubbing his apron with his fingers as if he were trying
to erase an unseen stain 
      OK   I said  Without looking at Harey  who was watching the
scene silently  her book on her lap   he went to the door  When it
closed behind him I stood up  I unfolded the paper I held in my
hand  The formulas were good  I hadnt doctored them  Though Im
not sure Siona would have recognized my solution  Probably not  I
gave a start  Harey had come up behind me and touched me on the
shoulder 
      Kris  
      What is it  darling  
      Who was that  
      I told you  Dr  Snaut  
      What kind of a person is he  
      I dont know him that well  Why do you ask  
      He was looking at me in this strange way      
     He probably found you attractive  
     No   she said with a shake of her head   It wasnt that kind of
look  He was looking at me as if      as if he      
    She shuddered  raised her eyes at me then lowered them right
away 
     Lets go somewhere else
