after six days  the lack of any reaction whatsoever inclined us to
repeat the experiment  at which the station  which thus far had stayed
in place at the intersection of the forty third parallel and the one
hundred and sixteenth meridian  moved off at an altitude of twelve
hundred feet above the ocean towards the south  where  as the radar
sensors and radiograms from the satelloid were indicating  there had
been significantly increased activity in the plasma 
     for two days the bundle of x rays modulated by my encephalo 
gram pounded the almost completely smooth surface of the ocean at
intervals of several hours 
     towards the end of the second day we found ourselves so close
to the pole that when the disk of the blue sun had almost completely
disappeared beyond the horizon  the crimson tinge of the clouds
in the opposite direction heralded the rising of the red sun  the
vast blackness of the ocean and the empty sky above it were then
filled with a blindingly fierce clash between hard colors aglow like
metal  glistening with poisonous green and subdued hollow flames
of crimson  while the ocean itself was rent with the glare of two
counterposed disks  two furious fires  one mercuric and one scarlet  at
such moments it was enough for the tiniest cloud to be at the zenith
for the rays falling across the diagonals of waves with their lumbering
foam to be lit up with an incredible rainbow glitter  immediately
following the setting of the blue sun  on the north west skyline  first
heralded by the indicators  there appeared a symmetriad  it was fused
almost indistinguishably with the red stained mist and arose out of
it only with isolated glinting reflections  like an immense glass flower
growing from the meeting point of sky and plasma  the station 
however  maintained its course  and fifteen minutes or so later the
colossus  red and trembling like a guttering lamp made of rubies 
vanished again beyond the horizon  a few minutes later a tall thin
pillar  whose base was hidden from our view by the curvature of the
planet  shot up soundlessly several miles into the atmosphere  this
clear indication of the end of the symmetriad wed seen  one side
fiery red  the other bright as a column of quicksilver  branched into a
two colored tree  then the extremities of its ever more spreading limbs
merged into a single mushroom shaped cloud whose upper portion
set off in the fire of two suns on a distant journey driven by the wind 
while the lower part fell extraordinarily slowly in ponderous clusterlike
fragments spread across a good third of the horizon  an hour later
the last trace of this spectacle had vanished 
     two more days passed  the experiment was repeated one final
time  the x rays had by now penetrated a sizeable expanse of the
plasmic ocean  to the south  from our altitude  despite the distance of
a hundred and eighty miles  we now began to have an excellent view
of the arrhenides  a sixfold rocky chain of what looked like snow 
capped peaks  these were in fact accumulations of organic matter 
showing that this formation had once constituted the bed of the
ocean 
     at this point we shifted to a south easterly course  moving for a
time in parallel with the mountain barrier that was augmented with
the clouds typical of the red day  till it too disappeared from view  by
now ten days had passed since the first experiment 
     the whole of that time  nothing really happened on the station 
once sartorius had completed the programming for the experiment 
it was repeated automatically by the equipment  im not even sure
whether anyone monitored it  yet at the same time a great deal
more than might have been desirable was happening on the station 
not among the humans  id been concerned sartorius would demand
that work on the annihilator be started again  i was also waiting to
see how snaut would react when he learned from the other man
that to a certain extent i had misled him  exaggerating the potential
danger that could come from destroying neutrino based matter  yet
nothing of the kind occurred  for reasons that initially were a complete
mystery to me  naturally i wondered too if this were some subterfuge 
if they were concealing from me certain preparations and operations 
so every day i checked out the windowless chamber beneath the deck
of the main laboratory where the annihilator was kept  i never found
anyone there  and the layer of dust on the casing and cables of the
apparatus indicated that no one had so much as touched it for weeks 
     during this time snaut became as invisible as sartorius  and more
elusive  because now even the visuphone in the radio station went
unanswered when it was called  someone must have been steering
the station  but i couldnt say who it was  and i didnt care  strange
as it may sound  the lack of response from the ocean had also left
me indifferent to the point that after two or three days id stopped
counting on it or worrying about it  and i forgot about the experiment
completely  i spent entire days either in the library or in my cabin 
with harey drifting around me like a shadow  i could see that things
were not good between us  and that this state of apathetic  mindless
suspension couldnt go on forever  i needed to break through it some 
how  change something in our relations  but i kept postponing even
the idea of any change  incapable as i was of making a decision  i
cant explain it any other way  but i had the feeling that everything
on the station  and especially what was between harey and me  was
presently in a frail  precarious equilibrium  and that moving it could
bring everything to ruin  why  i couldnt say  the strangest thing was
that she sensed something similar  to a degree in any case  when i
think about it now  it seems to me that the impression of uncertainty 
suspension  of the moment before an earthquake  was prompted by
a presence that could not be sensed in any other way and yet which
filled every deck and room on the station  though there was perhaps
one other way it could be made out  through dreams  never before
and never afterwards have such apparitions appeared to me  i decided
to write them down  and thats how im able to say anything at all
about them  but these are only fragments devoid of almost all their
terrifying richness  in circumstances that were essentially inexpress 
ible  i seemed to find myself in places devoid of sky  earth  floors 
ceilings  or walls  as if i were shrunken or imprisoned in a substance
that was alien to me  as if my whole body had become part of some
half dead  unmoving  shapeless lump  or  rather  that i myself was
that lump  deprived of flesh  surrounded by at first indistinct pale
pink patches suspended in a medium with different optical properties
than air  such that it was only from very close up things became clear 
even excessively and supernaturally so  because in those dreams of
mine my immediate surroundings were more concrete and material
than anything i experienced awake  whenever i woke up i had the
paradoxical feeling that the real waking life was in fact the other one 
and that what i saw when i opened my eyes was nothing but its
wizened shadow 
     such  then  was the first image  the beginning  from which the
dream unfolded  around me something would be waiting for per 
mission  for my say so  for an inner go ahead  and i knew  or rather
something inside of me knew  that i ought not to yield to this un 
accountable impulse  because the more i silently promised  the more
terrible the end would be  though really i did not know this  because
if i had id probably have been afraid  and i never felt any fear  i
waited  from the pink mist enveloping me there emerged the first
touch  while i  inert as a block of wood  enmired deep in whatever it
was that seemed to have locked me in  was unable to retreat or even
move  while that other thing examined my prison by touch  seeing
and unseeing at the same time  and it already seemed to be a hand
that was creating me  up till that moment i lacked even sight and now
i could see beneath the fingers that roamed about my face  out of
nothingness there emerged my lips  cheeks  and as that touch  broken
down into a thousand infinitely tiny parts  began to go further  i al 
ready had a face and a breathing torso  summoned to existence by this
symmetrical act of creation  for i myself  being created  was creating
in turn  and a face was coming into view that i had never seen before 
foreign and familiar  i tried to look into its eyes  but i was unable to 
because the proportions were constantly being changed  there were
no directions here  we were simply discovering one another in rapt si 
lence and mutually becoming  and i was already my living self  though
boundlessly enhanced  and that other being a woman  remained
motionless with me  a pulse filled us and we were one  and then
all at once the languor of this scene  beyond which nothing existed
nor seemed able to  began to be infiltrated by something unutterably
cruel  impossible  and unnatural  the same touch that had created
us and had clung to our bodies with an invisible golden cloak began
to pullulate  our bodies  naked and white  started to flow  blackening
into streams of writhing vermin that emerged out of us like air  and
i was we were i was a glistening  febrile mass of wormlike mo 
tion  tangling and untangling  but never ending  infinite  and in that
boundlessness no  i who was the boundlessness  i howled in si 
lence  asking to be extinguished  asking for an end  but it was exactly
at this moment i would run off in every direction at once and gather
back together in the form of a suffering that was more vivid than
any waking state  multiplied a hundredfold  concentrated in black and
red distances  now hardening into rock  now rising to a crescendo
somewhere in the glow of another sun or another world 
     this was the simplest of the dreams  the others im unable to
recount  because the sources of terror pulsating within them had no
counterpart in waking awareness  in them i knew nothing of the
existence of harey  but nor did i find in them any memories or
experiences from the preceding day 
     there were also other dreams in which  in darkness a congealed to
the point of lifelessness  i felt myself to be the object of experiments
being conducted slowly and painstakingly  without the use of any
sensory implements  they involved being penetrated and taken to
pieces and rubbed away into utter emptiness  and the underlying
foundation of all these silent  destroying crucifixions was a fear the
very recollection of which  in the daytime  made my heart race 
     the days  undifferentiated and as if faded  filled with wearying
ill will towards everything  inched by in extreme apathy  it was only
the nights that i was afraid of  not knowing how i could save myself
from them  i stayed awake with harey  who had no need of sleep  i
kissed her and caressed her  but i was aware that i wasnt doing it
either for her or for myself  that it was all because i was frightened of
sleep  though i didnt say a word to her about my ghastly nightmares 
she must have guessed something was up  because i sensed in her
little deaths a consciousness of unrelenting humiliation  and there was
nothing i could do about it  i mentioned before that the whole time i
saw neither snaut nor sartorius  but snaut would get in touch every
few days  sometimes with a note  but more often by summoning me
to the telephone  he would ask if i hadnt seen anything new  any
kind of change  something that could be interpreted as a reaction
elicited by the so frequently repeated experiment  i would say no 
and ask him the same question  snaut would merely shake his head
in the depths of the screen 
     on the fifteenth day after the operation had been discontinued i
woke earlier than usual  so exhausted by my bad dream that it felt
like i was coming out of heavy sedation  through the uncovered
window  in the first light of the red sun  whose immense reflection
sliced the smooth ocean in two with a river of crimson fire  i no 
ticed how the surface  inert up till now  was imperceptibly becoming
ruffled  it blackness initially grew paler  as if it had been covered
by a fine layer of mist  but the mist itself had an entirely material
consistency  here and there points of turbulence appeared  till the
vague movement spread to the entire expanse in sight  the blackness
vanished  concealed beneath membranes that were bright pink where
they bulged out and pearly brown in their hollow places  the colors 
which alternated to begin with  decorating this strange covering of
the ocean with long strips that seemed to freeze in place during the
movement of the waves  then mingled together  and the entire ocean
was coated by a foam of large bubbles that rose upwards in huge
sheets both immediately beneath the station and all around it  from
every side at once  tissue winged foam clouds rose into the empty
crimson sky  they extended horizontally  quite unlike real clouds  with
thick bulbous edges  the ones whose horizontal streaks obscured the
low disk of the sun were  in contrast to its glow  black as coal  others 
in the vicinity of the sun  depending on the angle at which the rays
from the east struck them  lit up cherry red or amaranthine purple 
and this process went on as if the ocean were peeling in a series
of bloody contour lines  every so often being blanketed with a new
coating of hardened foam  some of these formations floated up very
close  right outside the windows  passing only a few feet away  and
at a certain moment one of them brushed against the glass with its
silky looking surface  while the multitudes that had risen into the air
first were barely visible by now  far up in the sky like scattered birds 
dissolving at the zenith in a transparent precipitate 
     the station came to a stop  held in place  and remained so for
about three hours  the spectacle did not cease  towards the end  when
the sun had sunk below the horizon and the ocean beneath us was
concealed in darkness  the thousand fold throng of slender blushing
silhouettes rose ever higher into the sky  drifting in endless ranks as if
on invisible strings  still  weightless  and this magnificent ascension of
what looked like ragged wings went on till it was completely swallowed
up by the darkness 
     the entire spectacle  shocking in its placid immensity  terrified
harey  yet i was unable to tell her anything about it  because for
me as a solaricist it was just as new and unfathomable as for her 
but shapes and formations as yet unlisted in any inventory could be
observed two or three times a year on solaris  with a little luck  even
more often 
     the next night  about an hour before the expected rise of the
blue sun  we witnessed another phenomenon the phosphorizing of
the ocean  to begin with  on its surface shrouded in blackness there
appeared isolated patches of light  or rather of a whiteish glow that
was hazy and moved with the rhythm of the waves  the patches
joined together and spread till the spectral glimmer had reached the
horizon on all sides  the intensity of the light increased for a period
of about fifteen minutes  then the marvel ended in an astounding
manner  the ocean began to be extinguished  from the west  across a
front that must have been hundreds of miles wide a zone of darkness
advanced  when it reached the station and passed it the part of the
ocean that was still phosphorescent could be seen as a radiance rising
high into the shadows and moving further and further away to the
east  once it reached all the way to the horizon  it became like a
vast polar dawn  then suddenly disappeared  when the sun rose soon
afterwards the dead  empty expanse  barely marked with the wrinkles
of waves sending mercuric glints at the windows of the station  again
extended in every direction  the phosphorescence of the ocean had
already been described  in a certain percentage of cases it had been
observed before the emergence of asymmetriads  in addition to which
it was a rather characteristic indication of locally increased activity
in the plasma  yet for the next two weeks nothing happened either
outside the station or within it  only once  in the middle of the
night  i heard a distant shout that seemed to come from everywhere
and nowhere at once  it was remarkably high pitched  piercing and
prolonged  more of an inhumanly intensified wail  torn from my
nightmare  i lay there for a long while  listening intently  not entirely
sure that the shout wasnt also a dream  the previous day  from the
lab that was partially located above our cabin  there had come muffled
sounds like heavy objects or equipment being moved around  i had
the impression that the shout had also come from up there  though
exactly how was unclear  since the two floors were separated by a
soundproof ceiling  the dying voice went on almost half an hour 
drenched in perspiration  half mad  i was all set to race upstairs  such
was the effect of the sound on my nerves  but in the end it fell silent 
and once again only the moving of heavy objects could be heard 
    two days later  in the evening  as harey and i were sitting in
the small galley  snaut suddenly appeared  he was wearing a suit 
a real terrestrial suit  which transformed him  he looked taller and
older  hardly glancing at us  he went up to the table  leaned over it
and without sitting down began to eat cold meat straight from a can 
accompanying it with mouthfuls of bread  as he ate he dipped his
sleeve accidentally in the can and got grease on it 
     youre dirtying your jacket   i said 
     hm   he merely mumbled  his mouth full  he ate as if he hadnt
had anything for days  he poured himself half a cup of wine  drank it
in one  wiped his mouth and  taking a breath  looked around through
bloodshot eyes  he stared at me a moment and murmured 
     youve grown a beard  well  well      
    harey dropped the dishes into the sink with a clatter  snaut began
rocking lightly on his heels  he screwed his face up and smacked his
lips loudly  cleaning his teeth with his tongue  i had the impression
he was doing it deliberately 
     cant be bothered shaving  huh   he asked  gazing at me obnox 
iously  i didnt respond 
     be careful   he exclaimed after a moment   a word of advice  he
stopped shaving to begin with as well  
     go get some sleep   i murmured 
     what  you cant fool me  why should we not talk  listen  kelvin 
maybe it wishes us well  maybe its trying to make us happy  it just
doesnt yet know how  it reads our wishes from our brains  but only
two percent of our nervous processes are conscious  so it knows us
better than we know ourselves  so we should listen to it  acquiesce 
dont you think  you wont  why   he said  his voice breaking tearfully 
 why wont you shave  
     give it a rest   i snapped   youre drunk  
     drunk  me  what of it  cant a guy that dragged all his crap
from one end of the galaxy to the other to find out how much hes
worth  cant he get drunk  why not  i guess you believe in humanitys
mission  eh  kelvin  gibarian told me about you  before he grew his
beard      youre exactly the way he described      just dont come
up to the lab  or youll lose your faith      sartorius is at work there 
our faust in reverse looking for a cure for immortality  get it  hes
the last knight of the holy contact  hes all we deserve      his
previous idea was pretty good too endless death throes  not bad 
huh  agonia perpetua      straws      straw hats      how can you not
drink  kelvin  
    his eyes  almost completely hidden beneath their swollen lids 
came to rest on harey  who was standing motionless by the wall 
     o white aphrodite  born of the ocean  afflicted with greatness 
your hand          he began to recite  and choked on his own laughter 
     almost      word for word      eh  kelvin   he sputtered through
his coughing 
    i was still calm  but my calmness was beginning to harden into a
cold rage 
     stop it   i hissed   stop it and leave  
     youre kicking me out  you too  youre growing a beard  and
youre throwing me out  you dont want me to warn you any more  to
offer you advice  as one interstellar comrade to another  kelvin  lets
open the lower hatches  we can shout to it down there  below  maybe
itll hear us  but whats its name  think about it  weve named all
the stars and the planets  but maybe they already had names  such
arrogance  come on  lets go down there  we can call out to it     
tell it what its turned us into  itll be appalled      itll build us some
silver symmetriads and pray for us in its own math  and throw bloody
angels at us  and its suffering will be our suffering  its fear our fear 
and itll beg us for an end  because everything it is and everything it
does is a plea for an end  why are you not laughing  im just joking
around  if we had more of a sense of humor as a race  things might
not have gone this far  do you know what hes trying to do  hes
trying to punish it  this ocean  hes trying to make it howl through
every mountain      you dont think hell have the courage to present
his plan for the approval of that doddery old council of elders that
sent us out here as redeemers of other peoples sins  youre right 
hell chicken out      but only because of the hat  the hat he wont
mention to anyone  hes not that brave  our little faust      
      i said nothing  snaut was increasingly unsteady on his feet  tears
were rolling down his cheeks and dripping on his suit 
       who did it  which of us did it  gibarian  giese  einstein 
plato  they were all criminals you know  think about it  in a
rocket a person can burst like a bubble  or solidify completely  or boil 
or explode in a fountain of blood so quickly he doesnt have time
to shout out  and then only his bones will be clattering against the
metal  and theyll go on circling in newtonian orbit with an einsteinian
adjustment  our rattles of progress  and well go willingly  because
its a beautiful journey  till we arrive  and in these cabins  over this
tableware  amid the immortal dishwashers  with our serried ranks of
faithful lockers  our devoted toilets  here is our fulfillment      so you
see  kelvin if i wasnt drunk id not be talking like this  but someone
finally ought to say it  someone finally ought to  youre sitting here 
you child in the slaughterhouse  and your beard is growing      whose
fault is it  answer that question yourself      
      he turned slowly and left the galley  on the threshold he grabbed
hold of the door so as not to fall  then the sound of his steps reached
us from the corridor  i was avoiding hareys gaze  but at one moment
our eyes met  i wanted to go up to her  put my arms around her 
stroke her hair  but i couldnt  i couldnt
