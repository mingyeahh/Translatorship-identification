i had burns on my face and hands  i remembered that when id
been looking for sleeping pills for harey  id have laughed now at my
naivety  if i only could   in the first aid kit id noticed sunburn lotion 
so i went back to my cabin  i opened the door and in the red light
of the dawn i saw someone sitting in the armchair that harey had
been kneeling by earlier on  i was paralyzed with fear  i jerked back
instinctively  about to flee  it only lasted a split second  the person in
the chair looked up  it was snaut  with his back to me and his legs
crossed  he was still wearing the same linen pants with the reagent
burns   he was looking through some papers  there was a whole pile
of them on a small table  when he saw me he put them all aside and
stared at me for a moment despondently over his eyeglasses  which
were perched on the tip of his nose 
    without a word i went up to the washbasin  took the semi liquid
lotion from the first aid kit and began applying it to the worst places
on my forehead and cheeks  luckily i wasnt too swollen and my eyes
were fine  thanks to the fact that id closed them tight  i took a sterile
needle  punctured some of the bigger blisters on my temples and
cheeks and squeezed out the serous fluid  then i placed two sheets
of moistened gauze on my face  the whole time snaut observed me
closely  i paid him no heed  when i finally finished these operations
 my face stung more and more   i sat in the other armchair  i first
had to remove hareys dress from it  it was a perfectly ordinary dress 
aside from the matter of the missing fastener 
    snaut  his hands folded on his bony knees  was following my
movements critically 
     how about a chat   he said when i sat down 
    i didnt answer  i pressed on the gauze  which had begun to slide
down my cheek 
     so we had guests  did we  
     yes   i retorted drily  i didnt have the slightest desire to play
along with his tone 
     and we got rid of them  i must say you went about it very
energetically  
    he touched his forehead  which was still peeling  fresh patches of
new skin were beginning to appear  i stared at them  suddenly feeling
a fool  why hadnt i thought about snauts and sartoriuss so called
 sunburn  till now  all this time id thought it was from the sun but
of course no one goes sunbathing on solaris     
     though it was a fairly modest beginning  right   he said  ignoring
the sudden flash of understanding in my eyes   various narcotics 
poisons  catch as catch can  eh  
     whats your point  now we can talk as equals  if you feel like
acting the fool youd be better off leaving  
     sometimes a person cant help being a fool   he said  he looked
up at me through narrowed eyes 
     youre not going to try and tell me you never used rope or ham 
mer  you never threw an inkpot like luther  no  how about that   he
said with a grimace   youre quite the stand up guy  even the wash 
basin is undamaged  you didnt try to break any heads on it  nothing 
you didnt smash the cabin up  right away you just opened the rocket 
slammed it shut and wham bam thank you maam  launched it into
space and that was that   
    he glanced over at the clock 
     in that case we should have two hours  three even   he finished 
he stared at me  stared with a disagreeable smile  till he went on 
     so you reckon im a swine  
     a complete swine   i agreed forcefully 
     is that so  would you have believed me if id told you  would
you have believed a single word of it  
    i said nothing 
     gibarian was the first one it happened to   he continued  still
with his fake smile   he locked himself in his cabin  hed only talk
through the door  and us  can you guess what we figured  
    i knew  but i preferred to remain silent 
     its obvious we thought hed gone mad  he told us some of it
through the door  but not everything  you can probably even guess
why he wouldnt say who exactly was with him  you know full well 
suum cuique to each his own  but he was a true scientist  he
demanded that we give him a chance  
     what chance  
     i guess he was trying to classify it somehow  figure it out  he
worked through the night  you know what he did  i think you do  
     those calculations   i said   in the drawer  at the radio station 
that was him  
     yes  but at that point i knew nothing about it all  
     how long did it go on  
     the visit  a week maybe  talking through the door  all sorts
of things went on  we thought he was having hallucinations  that he
was under some kind of motor stimulus  i gave him scopolamine  
     you gave it to him   
     well  yes  he accepted it  but not for himself  he was experi 
menting  that was how things went  
     what about you two  
     us  on the third day we decided to force our way into his cabin 
to break down the door if we had to  we had noble intentions of
treating him  
     oh      that explains it   i exclaimed inadvertently 
     right  
     and there      in the locker      
     exactly  dear boy  exactly  he didnt know that in the meantime
wed had visitors  too  and we couldnt attend to him anymore  he
didnt know  now its      its kind of      routine  
    he said it so faintly that i surmised the last word rather than
actually hearing it 
     wait a minute  i dont follow   i said   surely you must have heard
something  you said yourself that you listened in at the door  you
must have heard two voices  so      
     no  there was only his voice  and even if thered been other
unidentifiable noises  you understand wed have assumed it was all
him      
     only him alone  but      why  
     i dont know  i admit i have a theory  but im in no hurry to
share it  especially since it doesnt help any  even if it explains a few
things  thats right  but you must have seen something yesterday
already  or youd have taken both of us for madmen  
     i thought id gone mad myself  
     is that right  so you didnt see anyone  
     i did  
     who   
    his grimace was no longer a smirk  i gave him a long stare before
i answered 
     the      black woman      
    he didnt say anything  but the whole of his body  tense and
leaning forward  relaxed imperceptibly 
     you might have warned me   i began  with less conviction now 
     i did  
     but how  
     the only possible way  you have to understand  i didnt know
who it would be  no one knows that  it cant be known      
     listen  snaut  i have some questions  youve known about it     
for some time  will she      it      whatll happen to her  
     are you asking if shell come back  
     right  
     yes and no      
     what does that mean  
     shell come back like at the beginning      of the first visit  she
wont know anything  or  to be precise  shell act as if everything you
did to get rid of her simply never took place  she wont be aggressive
unless you create conditions in which she has to be  
     what conditions  
     it depends on the circumstances  
     snaut  
     whats the problem  
     we cant afford the luxury of keeping secrets  
     its not a luxury   he interrupted drily   kelvin  i have the impres 
sion you still dont understand    though wait a moment  
    his eyes flashed 
     can you tell me who was here   
    i swallowed hard  and lowered my head  i didnt want to look at
him  i wished it were someone else  not him  but i had no choice 
a strip of gauze came unstuck and fell onto my arm  i shuddered at
the wet touch 
     a woman that i      
    i trailed off 
     she killed herself  she made a     she injected herself      
    he waited 
     she committed suicide   he asked  seeing i wasnt saying any 
thing 
     yes  
     and thats all  
    i said nothing 
     that cant be all      
    i glanced up sharply  he wasnt looking at me 
     how do you know  
    he didnt answer 
     all right   i said  i licked my lips   we had a falling out  well 
not exactly  it was me who said something to her  you know  the way
you do when youre angry  i packed my things and left  shed given
me to understand  she didnt say it outright  but when youve lived
with someone for years you dont need to      i was convinced it
was just talk that shed be afraid to do it  and      i told her that 
too  the next day i remembered id left the      the shots in a drawer 
she knew they were there id brought them home from the lab  id
needed them  at the time i told her what effect they have  i got
scared  i was going to go get them  but then i realized it would look
like i was taking her seriously  and      i let it be  the day after that
i went all the same  it was nagging at me  when i got there      she
was already dead  
     oh  you poor  innocent boy      
    i started in anger  but when i looked at him i could see he wasnt
making fun of me  i felt like i was looking at him for the first time 
his face was ashen  unutterable exhaustion lay in the deep folds of
his cheeks  he looked like someone gravely ill 
     why do you say that   i asked  strangely abashed 
     because the storys tragic  no no   he added hurriedly  seeing
me stir   you still dont get it  of course  you can experience that
as profoundly as you want  you can even see yourself as a murderer 
but      its not the worst thing in all this  
     is that so   i said sardonically 
     im glad you dont believe me  really  what happened may have
been terrible  but the most terrible thing is what      didnt happen 
ever  
     i dont follow         i said faintly  i truly didnt  he nodded 
     a normal person   he said   what is a normal person  someone
whos never done anything heinous  right  but has he never even
thought about it  or maybe he never thought about it  but something
inside him thought it  the idea popped into his head  ten or thirty
years ago  maybe he fought it off and forgot about it  and he wasnt
afraid  because he knew hed never carry it out  right  but now 
imagine that suddenly  in broad daylight  among other people  he
meets it embodied  chained to him  indestructible  what then  what
do you have then  
    i said nothing 
     the station   he said quietly   then you have solaris station  
     but      what could it actually be   i asked hesitantly   youre not
a criminal  after all  nor sartorius      
     come on  kelvin  youre a psychologist   he interrupted me im 
patiently   who hasnt had a dream like that  an imagining  think
of      of the fetishist whos in love with  i dont know  some dirty
underwear  who risks his skin to obtain by hook or by crook a dis 
gusting scrap of cloth that he adores  that has to be amusing  right 
hes disgusted by the object of his desire  and yet at the same time
crazy about it  prepared to put his life in danger for it his passion
may equal romeos for juliet      such things happen  its undeniable 
but surely you understand there are also other things      situations   
  the kind that no one has dared enact beyond their own thoughts  in
a single moment of confusion  breakdown  madness  call it what you
will  after which  the word becomes flesh  thats all  
      thats      all   i repeated mindlessly  in a hollow voice  my head
was in a whirl   but  but the station  what does the station have to
do with it  
      surely youre kidding   he murmured  he peered at me   this
whole time im talking about solaris  nothing but solaris  its not my
fault if its so drastically different from your expectations  besides 
youve already seen enough to at least hear me out 
      we head out into space  ready for anything  which is to say  for
solitude  arduous work  self sacrifice  and death  out of modesty we
dont say it aloud  but from time to time we think about how mag 
nificent we are  in the meantime in the meantime  were not trying
to conquer the universe  all we want is to expand earth to its limits 
some planets are said to be as hot and dry as the sahara  others as
icy as the poles or tropical as the brazilian jungle  were humani 
tarian and noble  weve no intention of subjugating other races  we
only want to impart our values to them and in return  to appropri 
ate their heritage  we see ourselves as knights of the holy contact 
thats another falsity  were not searching for anything except people 
we dont need other worlds  we need mirrors  we dont know what
to do with other worlds  one world is enough  even there we feel
stifled  we desire to find our own idealized image  theyre supposed
to be globes  civilizations more perfect than ours  in other worlds we
expect to find the image of our own primitive past  yet on the other
side theres something we refuse to accept  that we fend off  though
after all  from earth we didnt bring merely a distillation of virtues 
the heroic figure of humankind  we came here as we truly are  and
when the other side shows us that truth the part of it we pass over
in silence were unable to come to terms with it  
      then what is it   i asked  having heard him out patiently 
      its what we wanted  contact with another civilization  we have
it  this contact  our own monstrous ugliness  our own buffoonery and
shame  magnified as if it was under a microscope  
     rage shook in his voice 
      so you think its      the ocean  what for  though  never
mind how for a moment  for the love of god  what for   do you
really think its trying to play with us  or punish us  that would
be some truly primitive demonology  a planet taken over by a huge
devil who satisfies his satanic sense of humor by sending succubi to
members of a scientific expedition  surely you dont believe in such
utter nonsense   
      this devil is far from stupid   he muttered through his teeth  i
looked at him in surprise  it crossed my mind that after all  he could
have had a nervous breakdown  even if what had happened on the
station couldnt be explained by madness  reactive psychosis        i
wondered further  when he began to laugh very quietly  hardly making
any sound 
      youre diagnosing me  wait a while yet  youve actually only
experienced it in such a mild form you still dont know anything  
      i get it the devil took pity on me   i retorted  the conversation
was beginning to tire me 
      what is it youre really after  you want me to tell you what
plans are being hatched against us by x billion cells of metamorphic
plasma  maybe none at all  
      what do you mean  none   i asked  taken aback  snaut was still
smiling 
      you know as well as i do that science is only concerned with
how something happens  not why it happens  how  then  well  it
began about eight or nine days after the x ray experiment  maybe the
ocean was responding to the radiation with another kind of radiation 
maybe it was using it to probe our brains and get them to release
some kind of mental encystments  
      encystments  
     this was beginning to interest me 
      right  processes separated from the rest of the mind  enclosed 
suppressed  walled in  sore spots of the memory  it was treating
them as a recipe  as a plan for reconstruction      i mean  you
know the close resemblance between asymmetrical crystals of chro 
mosomes and the nucleic compounds of cerebrosides that constitute
the substrate of memory processes      after all  hereditary plasma is
plasma that remembers  so it took it from us  made a note of it  and
next  well  you know what came next  but why was it done  ha  in
any case  it wasnt to destroy us  that would have been a lot easier
to accomplish  with its technological abilities it could do anything at
all  for example confront us with our own doppelgangers  
      oh   i exclaimed   so thats why you were so scared the first
evening when i arrived  
      yes  though   he added   it may in fact have done so  how do
you know im the same good old rat who came here two years ago   
   
     he started laughing softly  as if my bewilderment gave him god
knows what kind of satisfaction  but he soon stopped 
      no  no   he murmured   theres enough going on without that   
  there may be other differences  but i only know one you and i
can be killed  
      and they cant  
      id advise you not to try  its a terrible thing to behold  
      not with anything  
      i dont know  in any case not with poison  knife  rope      
      atomic blaster  
      would you be prepared to try  
      im not sure  if you know theyre not human  
      the thing is  they are  in a certain sense  subjectively theyre
human  they have no awareness of their      origins  you must have
noticed  
      right  so then      how is it  
      they regenerate amazingly quickly  impossibly quickly  before
your eyes  im telling you  then they start all over again  behaving
like      like      
      like what  
      like our imaginations of them  the mental record that was used
to      
      thats right  its true   i agreed  i was ignoring the fact that lotion
was dripping from my cheeks onto my arms 
      did gibarian know         i asked abruptly  he gave me an intent
look 
      did he know what we know  
      yes  
      almost certainly  
      how do you know  did he tell you  
      no  but i found a book in his cabin      
      the minor apocrypha   i exclaimed  jumping up 
      right  how could you know about it   he asked  suddenly wor 
ried  his eyes boring into me  i shook my head 
      take it easy   i said   come on  you can see im burned and not
regenerating at all  right  in his cabin there was a letter to me  
      is that so  a letter  what did it say  
      not a lot  it was actually more of a note than a letter  it was
bibliographic references to the appendix of the yearbook of solaristics 
and to this minor apocrypha  what is it  
      its an old thing  it might have something to do with all this 
here  
     from his pocket he took a slim little leather bound volume with
tattered corners and handed it to me 
      and sartorius   i asked as i put the book away 
      what about sartorius  in a situation like this everyone acts what 
ever way      they can  hes trying to be normal with him that
means being official  
      come off it  
      seriously  one time i was in a situation with him  never mind the
details  suffice it to say we only had eleven hundred pounds of oxygen
left for eight people  one after another we gave up our daily tasks  by
the end everyone was walking around with a beard  he was the only
one who shaved  polished his shoes thats the kind of guy he is  of
course  whatever he does now is going to be playacting  comedy or
crime  
     crime  
     well  maybe not crime  we need a new term for it  like  jet 
propelled divorce  does that sound better  
     youre quite the wit   i said 
     would you rather i was crying  you suggest something  
     give me a break  
     no  i mean it  now you know more or less as much as me  do
you have a plan  
     i like that  i dont even know what im going to do when      she
appears again  she has to appear again  right  
     probably  
     how do they actually get in  i mean  the station is hermetically
sealed  maybe through the plating      
    he shook his head 
     the plating is in good shape  ive no idea how they do it  the
 guests are usually there when you wake up  and everyone has to
sleep from time to time  after all  
     what about locking them up  
     it helps for a short time  then there are other methods you
know what im talking about  
    he stood up  i followed suit 
     listen  snaut      you think the station should be closed down 
but you want the idea to come from me  
    he shook his head 
     its not that simple  naturally we could escape  if only to the
satelloid  and send an sos from there  obviously theyd treat us
like lunatics thered be a sanatorium on earth  until wed obligingly
retract the whole thing  after all  there have been cases of group
madness at isolated outposts like this      it wouldnt be so bad  a
nice garden  peace and quiet  white rooms  walks with the orderlies   
  
    he was completely serious  his hands in his pockets  staring va 
cantly into the corner of the room  the red sun had already dropped
below the horizon and the curling waves had melted into an inky
wasteland  the sky was afire  clouds with lilac tinted edges drifted
over the unutterably dismal two toned landscape 
     so do you want to run away  or not  not just yet  
    he smiled 
     you undaunted conqueror      you havent had a real taste of it
yet  or you wouldnt keep insisting like that  its not a matter of what
i want but of whats possible  
     what is  
     thats what i dont know  
     so we stay here  you reckon a meansll be found      
    he looked at me  scrawny  the skin on his wrinkled face peeling 
     who knows  maybe itll be worth it   he said finally   were
unlikely to learn anything about it  but maybe about ourselves      
    he turned  picked up his papers and left  i wanted to stop him 
but my open mouth made no sound  there was nothing to be done 
i could only wait  i went up to the window and looked out at the
blood black ocean without really seeing it  it occurred to me that i
could lock myself in one of the rockets at the docking bay  but i didnt
take the idea seriously  it was too silly sooner or later id have to
come out  i sat down by the window and took out the book snaut
had given me  there was still enough light  it turned the pages pink 
while the whole room glowed red  the book contained a number of
articles and studies  mostly of very dubious value  collected by one
otto ravintzer  m  phil  every science comes with its own pseudo 
science  a bizarre distortion that comes from a certain kind of mind 
astronomy has its caricaturist in astrology  chemistry used to have
alchemy  so little wonder that the emergence of solaristics was ac 
companied by a veritable explosion of the oddest notions  ravintzers
book was filled with this sort of mental matter prefaced  to be fair 
by an introduction in which the editor distanced himself from this
house of wonders  he simply believed  not without reason  that such
a collection might constitute a record of the times that would be of
value both to historians and to psychologists of science 
    bertons report occupied a prominent place in the book  it con 
sisted of several parts  the first was a transcription of his extremely
laconic logbook 
    from fourteen hundred to sixteen forty ships time  the notes were
terse and negative 
     altitude 3000 feet  or 4000  or 2500  nothing observed  ocean
deserted  this was repeated several times 
     then at 16 40  red mist rising  visibility 700 yards  ocean deserted 
     17 00  fog thickening  silence  visibility 400 yards with clearer mo 
ments  descending to 700 feet 
     17 20  in fog  altitude 700  visibility 20 40 yards  silence  climbing
to 1300 
     17 45  altitude 1600  banks of fog to the horizon  in the fog  funnel 
shaped openings through which ocean can be seen  something happen 
ing inside them  attempting to enter one such funnel 
     17 52  kind of whirlpool visible  throwing up yellow foam  am sur 
rounded by wall of fog  altitude 300  descending to 60 
     this was the end of the transcription from bertons logbook  the
next part of the so called report was an excerpt from his medical
history  to be precise  it was the text of a statement dictated by berton
and interspersed with questions from members of the commission 
     berton  when i dropped to a hundred feet  maintaining altitude
became difficult  because in the circular space free of fog there were
gusty winds  i had to keep a firm hold on the rudder  and for this
reason  for some time perhaps 10 or 15 minutes i didnt look out
of the cockpit  as a result  i unintentionally entered into the fog 
blown there by a strong gust  it wasnt ordinary fog but a kind of
suspension  colloidal in nature it seemed  because it clouded all my
windows  i had a lot of trouble cleaning them  the suspension was
extremely sticky  at the same time  my rotor speed had been reduced
by thirty some percent because of resistance from the fog or whatever
it was  and i began to lose altitude  i was very low and i was worried
id flip over on the waves  so i gave it full power  the craft maintained
altitude  but didnt rise any higher  i still had four cartridges of rocket
boosters  i chose not to use them  thinking the situation could get
worse and then id need them  at maximum revs the craft began
to vibrate badly  i figured the rotors must have gotten covered in the
strange suspension  but the load indicators were still showing zero  so
there was nothing i could do  i hadnt seen the sun from the moment
i entered the cloud  though the fog was a phosphorescent red in that
direction  i was still circling in the hope that id eventually come upon
one of those holes in the fog  and in fact i did about half an hour
later  i climbed into a free zone that was almost perfectly circular 
with a diameter of several hundred yards  it was bounded by fog
that was swirling dramatically  as if it were being lifted by powerful
convection currents  for this reason i attempted to remain as best i
could in the center of the hole that was where the air was calmest 
at that time i noticed a change in the surface of the ocean  the
waves had almost completely disappeared  and the top of the fluid 
the stuff the ocean is made of had become semi transparent  with
smoky spots that faded away until  after a very short time  the whole
thing was completely clear and i could see several yards  i believe  into
the depths  deep down there was a kind of gold colored ooze that
was gathering and sending thin streaks upwards  when it emerged
onto the surface it became glassy and shining  it started seething and
foaming  and solidifying  at this point it looked like dense burned
caramel  this ooze or sludge collected into thick knots  rose up out
of the ocean  it formed cauliflower like swellings and slowly made
various shapes  i started being pulled towards the wall of fog  so for
a few minutes i had to counter the drift with the engine and the
rudder  when i was able to look out again  down below  underneath
me  i saw something that resembled a garden  thats right  a garden 
i saw dwarf trees and hedges  paths  none of it real it was all made
of the same substance  which by now had completely hardened  like
yellowish plaster  that was how it appeared  the surface glistened
brightly  i descended as low as i could to get a closer look 
    question  did the trees and other plants you saw have leaves 
    berton  no  it was just a general shape like a model of a garden 
yes  thats it a model  that was what it looked like  a model  but
a life sized one  i guess  after a while it all began to crack and
break apart  through gaps that were completely black  a dense sludge
rose to the surface in waves and congealed  part trickled down  part
remained  and the whole thing began swirling and getting covered in
foam  so that now i couldnt see anything else but it  at the same
time the fog began to draw in around me on every side  so i cranked
it up and ascended to 1000 feet 
    q  are you completely certain that what you saw resembled a
garden and nothing else 
    berton  yes  because i noticed various details  i remember  for
example  that in one place there was a row of what looked like square
boxes  it occurred to me later they could have been beehives 
    q  it occurred to you later  but not at the moment you saw it 
    berton  no  because it all looked like it was made of plaster  i saw
other things as well 
    q  what things 
    berton  i cant say  because i didnt get a close look at them  i
had the impression that under several of the bushes there were some
kinds of tools  they were elongated shapes with protruding teeth  like
plaster casts of small gardening implements  but this im not entirely
sure about  the other thing i am 
    q  did it not occur to you that this might be a hallucination 
    berton  no  i thought it was a mirage  i didnt think about
hallucinations  because i was feeling absolutely fine  and also because
id never seen anything like it in my life before  when i climbed to
1000 feet the fog underneath me was pocked with cavities  it looked
like swiss cheese  one of the holes was empty and i could see the
waves  in others there was agitation  i descended into one of these
places and at a distance of about a hundred twenty feet i saw that
under the oceans surface though only just there was a wall  like
the wall of a very large building  it was clearly visible through the
waves  and it had rows of regular rectangular openings in it  like
windows  i even had the impression that in some of the windows
something was moving  that  im no longer completely sure about 
the wall began to rise slowly and emerge from the ocean  whole
waterfalls of ooze were dripping from it and there were some kind of
things made of ooze  sort of grainy condensations  all of a sudden
the wall broke in two and sank so quickly it disappeared at once  i
brought the craft back up higher and flew right over the fog  so close
i was almost touching it with my undercarriage  i saw another empty
funnel shaped place it was several times bigger than the first one  i
believe 
    even from far off i could see something floating  since it was light 
colored  almost white  i thought it was fechners space suit  especially
because its shape looked human  i made an abrupt about turn  i was
afraid id pass the place and not be able to find it again  the figure
rose upwards slightly at this moment  it looked as if it was swimming 
or standing up to its waist in the ocean  i made a hurried descent 
and came so close i felt the undercarriage hit something soft  the
crest of a wave  i guessed  since they were high in that place  the
person yes  it was a person was not wearing a space suit  despite
this he was moving 
    q  did you see his face 
    berton  yes 
    q  who was it 
    berton  it was a child 
    q  what child  had you ever seen it before in your life 
    berton  no  never  in any case  not that i can recall  besides 
as soon as i drew closer i was forty odd yards away  maybe a little
more i realized there was something wrong with it 
    q  what do you mean 
    berton  let me explain  at first i couldnt put my finger on it  it
was only a moment later that i realized  it was extraordinarily big 
gigantic would be more like it  it was maybe thirteen feet in length  i
remember distinctly that when the undercarriage hit the wave  its face
was a little higher than mine  and though i was sitting in the cockpit 
i must have been a good ten feet above the surface of the ocean 
    q  if it was so big  how do you know it was a child 
    berton  because it was a very small child 
    q  does that answer not strike you as illogical 
    berton  no  not at all  because i saw its face  besides  its body
was proportioned like that of a child  it looked to me like      almost
like a baby  no  thats going too far  it was perhaps two or three
years old  it had black hair and blue eyes  they were huge  and it
was naked  completely naked  like a new born infant  it was wet  or
rather slimy  its skin sort of shimmered 
    this sight had a terrible effect on me  i no longer believed it
could be a mirage  id seen it too close up  it was rising and falling
with the waves  but it was also moving independently of them  it was
disgusting 
    q  why  what was it doing 
    berton  it looked  well  like something in a museum  like a doll 
but a living doll  it was opening and closing its mouth and mak 
ing different movements  disgusting  because they werent its own
movements 
    q  can you say what you mean by that 
    berton  i didnt get closer than fifteen or so yards  maybe twenty
would be more accurate  but i already mentioned how huge it was 
and because of this i could see it extremely distinctly  its eyes were
shining and in general it gave the impression of a living child  it was
just those movements  as if someone were attempting      as if
someone were trying them out 
    q  can you explain that further 
    berton  im not sure i can  that was the impression i had  it was
intuitive  i didnt think about it  the movements were unnatural 
    q  are you trying to say that the arms  for example  were moving
in a way that isnt possible for human arms because of the limitations
of mobility in the joints 
    berton  no  thats not it at all  it was just      the movements
made no sense  normally any movement has some meaning  it serves
some purpose     
    q  you think so  the movements of an infant dont have to mean
anything 
    berton  im aware of that  but an infants movements are chaotic 
uncoordinated  theyre not specific  whereas these movements  they
were      oh  i know  they were methodical  they took place in
sequence  in groups and series  as if someone were trying to find out
what the child was capable of doing with its arms  what it could do
with its torso and its mouth  the worst was the face  i guess because
the face is the most expressive part of the body  that face was like
a face      no  i dont know how to describe it  it was alive  yes  yet
it wasnt human  i mean  the features very much were  the eyes  the
complexion  everything  but the look  the expressions  not at all 
    q  were these grimaces  do you know what a persons face looks
like during an epileptic seizure 
    berton  yes  ive seen such a seizure  i understand  no  it was
something else  in epilepsy there are contractions and twitches  while
these movements were entirely smooth and continuous  graceful  you
might say melodious  i cant think of another word  and the face 
with the face it was the same  a face cant look as if one half of it is
happy and the other half sad  as if one part is threatening or afraid
and the other half exultant  or something like that  but with this child
thats how it was  plus  all these movements and facial expressions
took place at an amazing speed  i was only there for a short time 
ten seconds perhaps  i dont know if it was even that long 
     q  and youre suggesting that you managed to see all that in such
a short time  besides  how do you know how long it lasted  did you
check your watch 
     berton  no  i didnt check my watch  but ive been flying for
sixteen years  in my line of work you have to be able estimate time
to the second  i mean short stretches of time  it becomes a matter
of instinct  you need it for landings  a pilot isnt worth his salt
if he cant tell whether a particular phenomenon lasts five seconds
or ten  regardless of whats going on around him  its the same with
observation  you learn it over the years  to take in as much as possible
in the shortest time 
     q  is that all you saw 
     berton  no  but the rest i dont remember in as much detail  i
suppose it was too powerful a dose for me  it felt like my brain was
bunged up  the fog was beginning to drop and i must have increased
altitude  i must have  but i dont remember how or when i did so  it
was the first time in my life i came close to flipping over  my hands
were shaking so badly i couldnt hold onto the rudder properly  i
believe i was shouting and calling the base  though i knew the radio
was down 
     q  at that time did you attempt to return 
     berton  no  because when i finally reached my ceiling it occurred
to me that fechner might be in one of those holes  i know it sounds
ridiculous  all the same  thats what i thought  since these kinds of
things are happening  i thought to myself  maybe ill manage to find
fechner as well  so i decided to enter as many of the holes in the fog
as i could  but the third time  when i climbed back up again i realized
that after what id seen i was in no state to continue  i couldnt do it 
i have to say this  and besides  its no secret  i suddenly felt sick  and
i vomited in the cockpit  id never experienced this before  id never
felt queasy 
     q  it was a symptom of poisoning  berton 
     berton  maybe  i dont know  but what i saw the third time  i
didnt make that up  that wasnt caused by poisoning 
     q  how do you know 
     berton  it wasnt a hallucination  a hallucination is something
created by my own brain  right 
     q  thats correct 
     berton  exactly  but this my brain could not have created  ill
never believe that  it wouldnt have been capable 
     q  how about you rather tell us what it was 
     berton  first i need to know how what ive said so far is going to
be treated 
     q  what does that have to do with it 
     berton  for me its fundamental  ive said that i saw something
ill never ever forget  if the commission determines that what i said is
even one percent plausible  such that certain research on the ocean
needs to be begun  then ill tell everything  but if the commission is
going to see it all as figments of my imagination  i wont say another
word 
     q  why not 
     berton  because the content of my hallucinations  however ghastly
they might be  is my private matter  whereas the content of my
experiences on solaris is not 
     q  does that mean you refuse to answer any more questions until
a decision is reached by the appropriate organs of the expedition 
you do understand that this committee is not authorized to make any
immediate decisions 
     berton  thats right 
     the first transcript ended at this point  there was also an excerpt
from a second  recorded eleven days later 
     chairman        and taking all this into consideration  the commis 
sion  comprising three medical doctors  three biologists  one physicist 
one mechanical engineer and the second in command of the expedi 
tion  has concluded that the incidents described by berton constitute
a hallucinatory syndrome resulting from poisoning by the atmosphere
of the planet  a condition in which symptoms of confusion were ac 
companied by a stimulation of the associative regions of the cerebral
cortex  and that these incidents had little or no correspondence in
reality 
     berton  excuse me  what does  little or no  mean  what is  little  
how big is it 
     chairman  allow me to finish  a separate minority report was
filed by dr  archibald messenger  physicist  who testified that what
berton described could in his opinion have happened in reality and
deserved careful investigation  that is all 
     berton  i repeat my previous question 
     chairman  the matter is simple   little  means that certain real
phenomena could have triggered your hallucinations  berton  on a
windy night the most normal person in the world can mistake a
swaying bush for a human figure  all the more so on an alien planet 
when the observers mind is affected by poison  this is no affront to
you  berton  in light of the preceding  what is your decision 
     berton  first  id like to know the consequences of dr  messengers
minority report 
     chairman  practically speaking  there are none  that is to say  no
investigation will be undertaken in that regard 
     berton  is what we are saying going to be transcribed 
     chairman  yes 
     berton  in that case i wish to say that in my view the commissions
decision is an affront not to me im not important here but to the
spirit of this expedition  as i stated the first time  i will not respond
to further questions 
     chairman  is that all 
     berton  yes  but i would like to talk with dr  messenger  is that
possible 
     chairman  of course 
     that was the end of the second transcript  at the bottom of page
there was a note in small print reporting that the following day dr 
messenger met with berton and spoke with him privately for almost
three hours  after which he wrote to the expeditionary board  calling
once again for an inquiry into the pilots testimony  he stated that
this was necessitated by additional new data given to him by berton 
which he could reveal only if the board agreed to the inquiry  the
board  comprising shannahan  timolis and trahier  turned down the
request  and the matter was closed 
    the book also contained a photocopy of one page of a letter found
in messengers papers after he died  it was probably a rough draft 
ravintzer had been unable to determine whether the letter itself had
been sent  or what its consequences had been  the text began 

            their colossal obtuseness  out of concern for its au 
      thority the board  and specifically shannahan and timolis
       trahiers voice didnt count   rejected my demands  now im
      appealing directly to the institute  but you yourself know
      such a protest is ineffectual  im bound by my word  so un 
      fortunately i cant tell you what berton told me  the boards
      decision was of course influenced by the fact that the revela 
      tions had come from a person with no academic standing 
      though a good many researchers would have envied that
      pilot his presence of mind and gift for observation  please 
      send me the following by return mail 

         1  fechners bio information  including his childhood 
        2  anything you know about his family and family
           matters  i gather he left behind a small child 
        3  the topography of the region in which he grew up 

      id also like to give you my own take on all this  as you
      know  a short time after fechner and carucci set out  in
      the center of the red sun a spot appeared whose corpuscu 
      lar radiation shut down radio communication  especially 
      according to data from the satelloid  in the southern hemi 
      sphere  in other words where our base was  of all the search
      parties  fechner and carucci went furthest from the base 
      the whole time wed been on the planet  up until the day
      of the accident we had never seen such dense  stubbornly
      lingering fog  accompanied by complete silence 
      i think that what berton saw was part of an  operation hu 
      man  being carried out by the viscous monster  the actual
      source of all the formations seen by berton was fechner 
      was his brain  in the course of some  mental autopsy 
      unimaginable to us  this was an experimental re creation 
      a reconstruction of certain traces in his memory probably
      those that were most enduring 
      i know this sounds fantastical  i know i could be wrong  so
      im asking you for help  im presently on alaric  where ill
      be waiting for your response 
      yours 
      a 

     it had gotten so dark i was barely able to read  the book turned
gray in my hands  the print began to melt away before my eyes  but
the blank space below the text showed i had come to the end of
the story  which in light of my own experiences i regarded as highly
plausible  i turned toward the window  outside there was a deep
purple  a few clouds smoldering above the horizon like dying embers 
the ocean was invisible  swathed in darkness  i heard the subdued
flutter of the paper strips over the vents  the heated air  with its
faint taste of ozone  had grown lifeless  an absolute silence filled the
entire station  i thought to myself that in our decision to remain 
there was nothing heroic  the time of valiant planetary struggles 
fearless expeditions  terrible deaths  like that of fechner  the oceans
first victim this era had come to an end long ago  i no longer really
cared who had  visited  snaut or sartorius  after a time  i thought 
well stop feeling embarrassed and hiding ourselves away  if we wont
be able to get rid of our  guests   well grow used to them and well
live with them  and if their creator changes the rules of the game well
adapt to the new ones  even if for a while well kick against the pricks 
raise a storm  one or another of us might even commit suicide  but
in the end the new state of affairs will also reach equilibrium  the
room was filling with a darkness ever more like that on earth  the
only lighter places now were the white shapes of the washbasin and
the mirror  i stood up  felt for the wad of cotton wool on the shelf 
moistened a ball of it and wiped my face  then i lay down on my back
on the bunk  somewhere overhead the vent thrummed and fell silent
in turn  sounding like a fluttering moth  i couldnt even make out the
window  everything was taken over by blackness  a glimmering streak
from who knew where was hovering before me  i couldnt tell whether
it was on the wall or far away in the barrenness beyond the window 
i recalled how horrified id been at the empty gaze of the solarian
space the previous evening  and i almost smiled  i wasnt afraid of it 
i wasnt afraid of anything  i brought my wrist close to my eyes  the
face of my watch lit up with its phosphorescent ring of figures  in an
hour the blue sun would rise  i reveled in the pervasive darkness  i
was breathing deeply  liberated from all thoughts 
     at a certain moment  when i moved i felt the flat shape of the tape
recorder against my hip  thats right  gibarian  his voice recorded
on tape  it didnt even occur to me to bring him back to life  to hear
what he had to say  that was all i could have done for him  i took
out the recorder to stow it under the bunk  i heard a rustle and the
faint creak of the door opening 
      kris   came a soft voice  almost a whisper   are you there  kris 
its so dark  
      dont mind that   i said   dont be afraid  come here
