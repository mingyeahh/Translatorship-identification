i had been lying in the dark room  in a trance  staring at the illu 
minated face of the watch on my wrist  for i dont know how long 
i was listening to my own breathing and feeling surprised at some 
thing  but all of this the staring at the greenish ring of figures  and
the surprise was steeped in an indifference i put down to exhaus 
tion  i turned on my side  the bed was oddly wide  something was
missing  i held my breath  there was absolute silence  i froze  not
the slightest whisper came from anywhere  harey  why couldnt i
hear her breathing  i felt the bedding with my hand  i was alone 
     harey   i was about to call out  but i heard footsteps  it was
someone large and heavy  like     
     gibarian   i said calmly 
     yes  its me  dont turn the light on  
     really  
     theres no need  that way itll be better for both of us  
     but youre dead  
     it doesnt matter  i mean  you do recognize my voice  
     yes  why did you do it  
     i had to  you were four days late  if youd gotten here sooner it
might not have been necessary  but dont feel bad  im fine  
     are you really here  
     oh  you think youre dreaming  like you thought about harey  
     where is she  
     what makes you think i know  
     im guessing you do  
     keep that thought to yourself  lets just say im here instead of
her  
     i want her to be here as well  
     thats not possible  
     why not  look  you do know that really its not you  its me 
right  
     no  its really me  if you wanted to be pedantic you could say its
me again  but lets not waste words  
     will you go away  
     yes  
     and then shell come back  
     is that what you want  what is she to you  
     thats my business  
     but youre afraid of her  
     no  im not  
     and disgusted by her      
     what do you want from me  
     you can feel sorry for yourself  but not for her  shes always going
to be twenty years old  dont pretend you dont know that  
    all of a sudden  i have no idea why  i calmed down  i listened
to him with equanimity  i had the impression he was standing ever
closer  at the foot of the bed  but i still couldnt see anything in the
darkness 
     what are you after   i asked quietly  my tone seemed to surprise
him  he was silent for a moment 
     sartorius has convinced snaut that you hoodwinked him  now
theyre doing the same to you  theyre pretending to assemble the
x ray equipment but theyre actually building a field annihilator  
     where is she   i asked 
     did you not hear what i just said to you  im trying to warn you  
     where is she  
     i dont know  listen up  youll need a weapon  you cant count
on anyone  
     i can count on harey   i said  i heard a low rapid sound  he was
laughing 
     sure you can  up to a certain point  in the end you can always
do what i did  
     youre not gibarian  
     how do you like that  and who am i  a dream of yours maybe  
     no  their puppet  but you dont know it  
     and how do you know who you are  
    that made me think  i wanted to get up but i couldnt  gibarian
was saying something  i couldnt understand the words  i only heard
the sound of his voic   i was struggling desperately with the weakness
of the flesh  i made one more colossal effort  jerked my body      and
woke up  i gasped for air like a half suffocated fish  it was completely
dark  it had been a dream  a nightmare  but just a moment       a
dilemma were not able to resolve  we persecute our own selves  all
polytheria did was apply a kind of selective amplifier to our thoughts 
seeking a motivation for this is anthropomorphism  where there are
no humans  there are none of the motives available to humans  to
continue the projected research wed have had to destroy either our
own thoughts or their material realization  the former is beyond our
powers  the latter looks too much like murder  
    in the darkness i listened to the distant  measured voice that i had
recognized at once  it was gibarian  i stretched out my hand  the
bed was empty 
    ive woken into another dream  i thought 
     gibarian         i said  the voice broke off at once in mid word 
there was a soft click and i felt a faint puff of air on my face 
     really  gibarian   i muttered with a yawn   following someone
from one dream into another  come off it      
    there was a rustling sound next to me 
     gibarian   i repeated more loudly 
    the bedsprings moved 
     kris      its me         came a whisper right by me 
     oh  its you  harey      wheres gibarian  
     kris      kris      surely hes      you yourself said he died      
     he might be alive in a dream   i said slowly  i was no longer at
all certain it had been a dream   he was saying something  he was
here   i added  i was fearfully sleepy  if im sleepy  i must be asleep  i
thought to myself idiotically  i brushed hareys cold arm with my lips
and arranged myself more comfortably  she said something in reply 
but i was already plunged in oblivion 
    in the morning  in the red sunlight of the room  i recalled the
events of the night  the conversation with gibarian had been a dream 
but the things that had happened next  id heard his voice  i could
have sworn it  i just didnt quite remember what hed been saying  it
hadnt sounded like a conversation  more like a lecture  a lecture     
 
    harey was getting washed  i heard the splash of water in the
bathroom  i looked under the bed  where id shoved the tape recorder
a few days before  it wasnt there 
     harey   i called  her face  dripping water  appeared from behind
the locker 
     you didnt see a tape recorder under the bed by any chance  did
you  a little pocket sized one  
     there were various things under there  i put them all over on
that shelf   she pointed to near the medicine cabinet and vanished
back into the bathroom  i jumped out of bed  but i couldnt find what
i was looking for 
     you must have seen it   i said when she came back into the main
room  she combed her hair in front of the mirror and didnt reply 
it was only now i noticed she was pale  and that when her eyes met
mine in the mirror there was a searching look in them 
     harey   i began again insistently   the tape recorder isnt on the
shelf  
     you dont have anything more important to tell me  
     im sorry   i murmured   youre right  its not that big of a deal  
    that was all we needed to start an argument 
    after that we went to get breakfast  harey was doing everything
differently than usual that day  but i couldnt put my finger on what
exactly had changed  she was looking closely at everything around
her  a couple of times she didnt hear what i was saying to her  as if
shed suddenly gotten lost in thought  one time  when she raised her
head i saw her eyes were glistening 
      whats wrong   i asked  lowering my voice to a whisper   are you
crying  
      let it be  theyre not real tears   she stammered  perhaps i
shouldnt have left it at that  but there was nothing i was so afraid of
as  heart to hearts   besides  i had other things on my mind  though
i knew snaut and sartoriuss scheming had only been a dream  id
begun to wonder if there was some kind of handy weapon on the
station  id no idea what i would do with it  i just wanted to have
it  i told harey i needed to swing by the hold and the depositories 
she followed me in silence  i searched among the crates and rifled
through the capsules  then  when i went all the way down to the
lowest floor  i couldnt resist the temptation to look in on the cold
room  i didnt want harey to go in there though  so i just half opened
the door and checked the whole place over with my eyes  the dark
shroud bulged over the elongated figure beneath  but from where i
was standing i couldnt tell if the black woman was still lying where
she had been  it seemed to me that her place was empty 
     i didnt find anything i could use  and i was in an ever worsening
mood as i wandered about  till all at once i realized i couldnt
see harey  she appeared right after that shed stayed back in the
corridor yet the very fact shed tried to distance herself from me 
something that was so hard for her even for a moment  should have
made me think  but i was still acting offended at no one in particular 
or just generally behaving like a jerk  id gotten a headache  i couldnt
find any aspirin and  mad as hell  i tipped out the entire contents of
the first aid kit  i couldnt be bothered to go back to the surgery  id
rarely been such a mess as i was that day  harey was moving about
the cabin like a shadow  from time to time shed disappear  in the
afternoon  after wed eaten lunch  though in fact she rarely ate at all 
while id lost my appetite from the headache and didnt even press
her to have something   all of a sudden she sat down next to me and
began picking at the sleeve of my shirt 
      hows it going   i murmured absently  i had an urge to go
upstairs  because i had the impression the pipes were carrying a faint
echo of knocking sounds  meaning that sartorius was tinkering with
the high tension apparatus  but i lost interest when it occurred to
me that id have to go with harey  whose presence might have been
semi understandable in the library  but there  among the machinery 
might have led snaut to make some inopportune remark 
     kris   she whispered   how are things between us        
    i gave a sigh despite myself  i cant say it was a happy day for me 
     couldnt be better  why do you ask  
     i wanted to have a talk with you  
     fire away  
     not that kind of talk  
     then what kind  like i said  ive got a headache  ive all kind of
things on my mind      
     a little good will  kris  
    i forced myself to smile  it couldnt have been impressive 
     what is it  darling  im listening  
     will you tell me the truth  
    i raised my eyebrows  i didnt like this as an opener 
     why would i lie  
     you might have your reasons  serious ones  but if you want there
to be      you know      then dont lie to me  
    i said nothing 
     ill tell you something and youll tell me something  ok  itll be
the truth  regardless of anything else  
    i wasnt looking her in the eye  she sought my gaze  but i pre 
tended not to notice 
     i already told you that i dont know how i got here  but maybe
you know  wait  i havent finished  maybe you dont know  but if you
know and its just that youre not able to tell me now  then will you
later  one day  that wont be the worst thing  in any case youll give
me a chance  
    i had the sensation of an icy current running through my entire
body 
     what are you saying  kid  what chance         i mumbled 
     kris  whoever i am  im for sure no kid  you promised  tell me  
    that  whoever i am  gave me such a lump in my throat that all i
could do was stare at her  shaking my head like an idiot  as if i were
trying to prevent myself from hearing everything 
     i already said you dont have to tell me  its enough for you to
say you cant  
     im not hiding anything         i answered hoarsely 
     very good then   she replied  standing up  i wanted to say some 
thing  i sensed i shouldnt leave her like that  but all the words stuck
in my throat 
     harey      
    she was by the window  her back to me  the empty dark blue
ocean lay beneath a bare sky 
     harey  if you think that      harey  you know i love you      
     you love me  
    i went up to her  i tried to put my arms around her  she freed
herself  pushing my hand aside 
     youre so good   she said   you love me  id rather you beat me  
     harey  darling  
     no  no  best just dont say a thing  
    she went up to the table and began clearing away the plates  i
stared into the dark blue emptiness  the sun was starting to set  and
the great shadow of the station moved evenly on the waves  a plate
slipped out of hareys hands and fell on the floor  water sounded in
the sinks  at the edges of the horizon the ruddy color turned to a
dirty reddish gold  if only i knew what to do  oh  if only i knew  all
at once things went quiet  harey came and stood right by me 
     no  dont turn around   she said  lowering her voice to a whisper 
 none of this is your fault  kris  i know it  dont worry  
    i reached out my hand towards her  she escaped to the other side
of the cabin and  picking up a whole pile of plates  she said 
     pity  if they could be broken  id smash them  i really would
smash all of them  
    for a moment i thought she was actually going to fling them to
the ground  but she threw me a keen glance and smiled 
     dont be scared  im not going to make a scene  
     i woke up in the middle of the night  instantly intent and watchful 
i sat up in bed  the room was dark  though a faint light came from the
corridor through the cracked open door  there was a nasty hissing
sound that was intensifying  and at the same time there were dull
stifled thuds as if something large were thrashing about in the next
room  a meteor  came a rapid thought  its broken through the armor
plating  someones there  there was a prolonged wheezing 
     i finally regained my senses  it was the station  not a rocket  and
that awful noise     
     i ran into the corridor  the door to the small lab was wide open
and the light was on  i hurried inside 
     i was struck by a wave of fearful cold  the cabin was filled with
vapor that turned my breath to snow  a mass of white flakes were
spinning over a body wrapped in a bathrobe that was lying on the
floor and tossing weakly  i could barely see her through the icy cloud 
i rushed up to her  picked her up  the robe burned my hands  she
was rasping  i ran back into the corridor  past a series of doors  i no
longer felt the cold  except that the breath coming out of her mouth
in clouds of condensation scorched my neck like fire 
     i laid her on the table  tore open the robe over her breasts  for a
moment i looked at her drawn  trembling face  the blood had frozen
on her open lips  covering them with a dark coating  tiny ice crystals
glittered on her tongue     
     liquid oxygen  there was liquid oxygen in the shop  in dewar
flasks  as i picked her up id felt broken glass underfoot  how much
could she have swallowed  it made no difference  her trachea was
burned  and her throat and lungs  liquid oxygen is more caustic than
any concentrated acid  her breathing  raucous and dry as the sound
of paper being torn  was growing shallower  her eyes were closed  it
was the death throes 
     i looked at the large glass paneled cabinets with instruments and
medications  a tracheotomy  an intubation  except she had no lungs 
they were burned up  medication  there were so many different
kinds  the shelves were filled with colored bottles and packets  the
wheezing sound filled the whole room  vapor was still coming from
her open mouth 
     hot water bottles     
     i started looking for them  but before i found any i darted across
to the other cabinet and began rifling through boxes of ampoules 
now i found a needle  which i fumbled to put in the sterilizer  my
fingers stiff with cold and clumsy  i hammered furiously on the lid
of the sterilizer  but i couldnt even feel it  the only sensation was a
slight tingling  she made a louder wheezing sound  i hurried over to
her  her eyes were open 
      harey  
     it wasnt even a whisper  i couldnt speak  her face was alien  as
if made of plaster  it brought me up sharp  her ribs were twitching
under her white skin  her hair  wet from melting snow  lay scattered
around her head  she was looking at me 
      harey  
     i was unable to say any more  i stood there like a lump of wood
with those unwieldy foreign hands of mine  my feet  lips  eyelids were
starting to sting ever more painfully  but i barely felt it  a droplet
of blood that had melted in the heat ran down her cheek  leaving a
diagonal mark  her tongue quivered and disappeared  she was still
rasping 
     i took her wrist  she had no pulse  i pulled apart the lapels of the
robe and placed my ear against the fearfully cold body right beneath
her breast  through a crackling roar like a fire i heard a pit a pat 
a galloping sound too fast to count  i stood there leaning over her 
my eyes closed  when something touched my head  she had dug her
fingers into my hair  i looked into her eyes 
      kris   she croaked  i grasped her hand in mine  she squeezed it
back  almost crushing it  consciousness was ebbing from her horribly
distorted face  the whites of her eyes flashed beneath her eyelids 
there was a snort from her throat and her whole body was shaken by
convulsions  i was barely able to hold onto her as she hung over the
side of the table  she knocked her head against the side of a porcelain
funnel  i pulled her up and pressed her to the table  with each new
spasm she tugged away from me  i immediately became drenched in
sweat  my legs felt like cotton wool  when the convulsions eased off
i tried to lie her down again  she was making a squeaking sound as
she gasped for air  all of a sudden  hareys eyes lit up in that terrible
bloody face 
      kris   she gasped   how much      how much longer  kris  
     she began to choke  foam appeared on her lips and the convul 
sions began again  i held her down with all the strength i had left 
she collapsed on her back so abruptly her teeth clattered  she was
panting 
      no  no  no   she exclaimed rapidly with each outbreath  each one
seemed it would be the last  but the convulsions returned again and
once more she writhed in my arms  in the short pauses drawing in
air with such an effort her ribcage bulged  finally her eyelids dropped
half way over her open  unseeing eyes  she stopped moving  i thought
it was the end  i didnt even try to wipe the pink foam from her lips 
i stood over her  leaning forward  hearing some great distant bell  and
waited for her last breath so that after it i could crumple onto the
floor  but she kept on breathing  only slightly wheezing  ever quieter 
and the tip of her breast  which had almost stopped quivering  began
to move to the quick rhythm of a working heart  i stood hunched
over her  and her face began to regain color  i still didnt understand
a thing  the palms of both my hands grew moist  and i felt i was
going deaf  that something soft and springy was filling my ears  i
could still hear the ringing bell  which now sounded hollow  like with
a broken heart 
     she raised her eyelids and our eyes met 
      harey   i tried to say  but i seemed to have no mouth  my face
was a heavy lifeless mask  and all i could do was look 
     her eyes ran around the room  her head moved  everything was
completely quiet  behind me  in another  far off world  water was
dripping regularly from a tap that hadnt been properly turned off 
she rose on one elbow  she sat up  i drew back  she was watching
me 
      so         she said   so        it didnt      work  why not       
why are you looking at me like that        
     and suddenly  with a terrible scream 
      why are you looking at me like that   
     silence fell  she looked at her hands  wiggled her fingers 
      is this me         she asked 
      harey   i said without breath  merely moving my lips  she raised
her head 
      harey         she repeated  she slid down slowly onto the floor
and stood up  she staggered  regained her balance  took a few steps 
all this she did in a kind of daze  looking at me but seemingly without
seeing me 
      harey   she repeated slowly one more time   but       i      im
not harey  and who      am i  harey  and you  you   
     suddenly her eyes opened wide  flashed  and the shadow of a
smile  of utter astonishment  lit up her face 
      maybe you too  kris  maybe you too   
     i said nothing  leaning back against a locker  where fear had driven
me 
     she dropped her arms 
      no   she said   no  because youre afraid  listen to me  though 
i cant do it  this isnt right  i didnt know anything about it  i
still dont get it even now  i mean  surely its not possible   she
clenched her fists so tight they turned white  and pressed them to her
chest   i dont know anything except  except harey  do you think im
pretending maybe  im not pretending  cross my heart  im not  
     her last words turned into a groan  she slumped to the floor 
sobbing  what she had shouted had shattered something inside of
me  in one long stride i reached her and seized her in my arms  she
fought back  pushing me away  sobbing without tears  exclaiming 
      let me go  let me go  i disgust you  i know  i dont want things
this way  i dont  you see it  you know you do  that its not me  not
me  not me  
      quiet   i cried  shaking her  we were both screaming  on our
knees facing one another  hareys head was thrashing  knocking
against my shoulder  i pulled her to myself with all my strength 
all of a sudden we were still  breathing heavily  water was dripping
evenly from the faucet 
      kris   she mumbled  pressing her face into my arm   tell me
what i need to do so i wont be there anymore  kris      
      stop it   i yelled  she raised her face  stared at me 
      what do you mean        you dont know either  theres nothing
can be done  nothing  
      harey        for pitys sake      
      i wanted to      you saw  no  no  let me go  i dont want you to
touch me  i disgust you  
      thats not true  
      youre lying  i must disgust you  i      i disgust myself      as
well  if i could  if i only could      
      youd kill yourself  
      yes  
      but i dont want that  you understand  i dont want you to kill
yourself  i want you to be here  with me  i dont need anything else  
     her huge gray eyes devoured me 
      if youre lying         she said ever so softly 
     i let go of her and stood up  she sat back on the floor 
      tell me what i need to do to make you believe im saying what i
think  that its the truth  that theres no other  
      you cant say the truth  im not harey  
      then who are you  
     she was silent for a long while  her chin twitched over and over 
till she lowered her head and whispered 
      harey      but      but i know that isnt true  its not me      that
you loved back then  long ago      
      yes   i said   what was then is dead and gone  but you  here  i
love  you understand  
     she shook her head 
      youre good  dont think i dont appreciate all that youve done 
you did the best you could  but it cant be helped  when i sat by your
bed in the early morning three days ago  waiting for you to wake up 
i didnt know a thing  that seems such a very long time ago  i was
acting like i wasnt all there  it was like my head was filled with fog 
i didnt remember what had come earlier and what had come later 
and nothing surprised me  it was like coming round after anesthetic 
or recovering from a long illness  i even thought maybe id been sick 
and it was just that you wouldnt tell me  then later  more and more
things made me wonder  you know which things  i already had an
inkling after the conversation you had in the library with that  whats
his name  snaut  and since you wouldnt say anything  i got up in the
night and played the tape recorder  i only lied that one time  because
i hid it afterwards  kris  what was the name of the man who was
talking on it  
     gibarian  
     right  gibarian  at that moment i understood everything  though
truth be told i still didnt understand anything  there was one thing i
didnt know  that i couldnt      that i wasnt      that it would end   
  without an end  he didnt say anything about that  though maybe
he did  but you woke up and i turned off the tape  even so  i heard
enough to find out that im not a person but an instrument  
     what are you talking about  
     thats right  to test your reactions or something like that  each
of you has something like me  its based on memories or on the
imagination  its suppressed  something along those lines  besides 
you know all this better than i do  he said such terrible  inconceivable
things  if it hadnt all added up i dont think i would have believed
him  
     what added up  
     you know  that i dont need sleep and i always have to be by you 
yesterday morning i still thought you hated me  and that made me
sad  good lord  how stupid i was  but tell me  tell me yourself  could
i have imagined this  i mean  he didnt hate that woman of his at all 
but the things he said about her  it was only then i understood that
whatever i might do it made no difference  because whether i want it
or not  it must be torture for you  or actually even worse  because a
torture implement is as lifeless and innocent as a rock that can fall
and kill you  but an implement that could have good intentions and
could love this i couldnt imagine  id like to tell you at least what
went on inside me then  later  when i understood  when i listened to
the tape  it might at least come in useful for you  i even tried to write
it down      
     is that why you turned on the light   i asked  i suddenly felt
choked  i had difficulty speaking 
     yes  but nothing came of it  because i was searching inside
myself  you know       for them for that something else  i was
completely mad  i can tell you  for a while i had the feeling that i
didnt have a body under my skin  that inside me there was something
else  that i was only a surface  there to fool you  you follow  
      i do  
      when you lie for hours through the night like that  in your
thoughts you can go very far  and in very strange directions  you
know      
      i know  
      but i could feel my heart  and besides  i remembered that youd
tested my blood  whats my blood like  tell me  tell me the truth 
surely you can now  
      its the same as mine  
      really  
      i swear  
      what does that mean  you know  later it occurred to me that
maybe it is hidden inside me  that its      i mean  it could be very
small  but i didnt know where  now i think that at bottom i was
dodging the issue  because i was terrified of what i planned to do 
and i was looking for another way out  but kris  if i have the same
blood      if its the way you say  then      no  thats not possible  i
mean  id be dead already  wouldnt i  that means there is something
after all  but where is it  maybe in my head  yet my thoughts are
completely ordinary      and i dont know anything      if i were
thinking through it  i ought to know everything right away  and not
love you  just pretend  and know that im pretending      kris  please 
tell me all you know  maybe something can be done after all  
      what could be done  
     she was silent 
      do you want to die  
      i think so  
     once again there was silence  i stood above her as she sat there
hunched over  i stared at the empty interior of the room  the white
enameled surfaces of the apparatus  at the shining scattered imple 
ments  as if i were searching for something terribly necessary and i
couldnt find it 
     harey  can i say something too  
    she waited 
     its true that youre not entirely like me  but that doesnt mean
youre worse  quite the opposite  well  you can think any way you
like about it  but its thanks to that      that you survived  
    a kind of pathetic childlike smile appeared on her face 
     is that supposed to mean im      immortal  
     i dont know  in any case youre a lot less mortal than me  
     how awful   she whispered 
     maybe not as much as you think  
     but you dont envy me      
     harey  its more a question of your      purpose  as i might
call it  you know  here on the station your purpose is essentially as
mysterious as mine  as that of any of us  the other men are going to
continue gibarians experiment and anything could happen      
     or nothing  
     or nothing  and to be honest id rather it was nothing  not even
because im afraid  though i guess that plays a part  im not sure   but
because it wont do any good  thats the one thing im certain of  
     it wont do any good   why not  is it about the      the ocean  
    she shuddered 
     thats right  its about contact  in my view  the whole thing is in
essence extremely simple  contact means an exchange of experiences 
concepts  or at least results  conditions  but what if theres nothing
to exchange  if an elephant isnt a very large bacterium  then an
ocean cant be a very large brain  of course  various actions can be
performed by both sides  as a result of one of them im looking at
you right now and trying to explain to you that youre more precious
to me than the twelve years of my life i devoted to solaris  and
that i want to go on being with you  perhaps your appearance was
meant to be torture  perhaps a reward  or perhaps just a test under a
microscope  an expression of friendship  a treacherous blow  perhaps
a taunt  perhaps everything at once or as seems most likely to me 
something entirely different  but what can you and i really care about
the intentions of our parents  however different they were from one
another  you can say that our future depends on those intentions 
and id agree with you  i cant predict whats to come  nor can you 
i cant even assure you ill always love you  if so much has already
happened  then anything can happen  maybe tomorrow ill turn into
a green jellyfish  it doesnt depend on me  but in what does depend
on us  well be together  is that not something  
     listen   she said   theres one other thing  am i      really like     
her  
     you were   i said   but now i dont know any more  
     what do you mean        
    she got to her feet and looked at me with eyes wide open 
     youve already taken her place  
     and youre sure its not her but me that you      me  
     yes  you  i dont know  im afraid that if you were really her  id
not be able to love you  
     why not  
     because i did something terrible  
     to her  
     yes  when we were  
     dont say  
     why not  
     because i want you to know that im not her
