id carried out my calculations in a kind of silent doggedness that
had been the only thing keeping me on my feet  i was so dazed
by exhaustion that i couldnt figure out how to set up the bunk in
the cabin  instead of releasing the top latches i just pulled on the
rail  and all the bedding fell on me  when i finally got it down  i
tossed my clothes and underwear on the floor and  barely conscious 
dropped onto the pillow  which i hadnt even properly inflated  i dont
know when i fell asleep  the light was still on  when i opened my
eyes i had the feeling id only been sleeping a few minutes  the
room was filled with a cloudy red glow  i felt cold and i felt fine  i
lay naked outside the covers  across from the bed  by the window 
which was half covered by the shades  someone was sitting in the
light of the red sun  it was    in a white summer dress  her
legs were crossed  she was barefoot  her dark hair was tied back  the
sheer material was taut over her breasts  her dangling arms were
tanned to the elbows  she sat motionless  looking at me from under
dark eyelashes  i gazed at her for a long time  entirely calm  my first
thought was   im glad this is one of those dreams where you know
youre dreaming   all the same  id have preferred her not to be there 
i closed my eyes and began to wish this intensely  but when i opened
them again she was still sitting there  her mouth was set in the way it
always used to be  as if she was about to whistle  but her eyes werent
smiling in the slightest  i recalled everything id been thinking about
dreams the previous evening before i fell asleep  she looked exactly
like she had the last time i saw her alive  at that time shed only
been nineteen years old  today she would have been twenty nine  but
naturally she hadnt altered the dead remain young  she had the
same eyes that were surprised at everything  and she was looking at
me  ill throw something at her  i thought  but though it was only a
dream  i somehow couldnt bring myself to throw objects at a dead
woman 
     you poor little thing   i said   youve come to visit me  huh  
    i got a little scared  because my voice sounded normal  and the
whole room and   it all looked as real as could be imagined 
    the dream was so vivid not only was it in color  on the floor
i could also see a number of objects that i hadnt even noticed as i
went to bed  when i wake up  i thought  ill have to check whether
theyre actually there or whether theyre a creation of my dream  like
      
     are you going to be sitting there much longer   i asked  and i
noticed i was speaking softly  like i was afraid someone might hear
me as if anyone could hear what happens in a dream 
    in the meantime the red sun had risen a little higher  even that
much is good  i thought  i went to sleep during the red day  now it
ought to be blue  and only after that would come the next red day 
i couldnt possibly have slept for fifteen hours straight  so this was
definitely a dream 
    reassured  i studied   closely  she was lit from behind  a
ray of light coming through a crack in the curtains gilded the velvety
down on her left cheek  and her eyelashes cast a long shadow on
her face  she was lovely  how about that  i thought to myself  how
exact i am even when im not awake  i check the movement of the
sun  and make sure she has that dimple of hers where nobody else
has one  under the corner of her perpetually surprised mouth  all the
same  i wished it would end  i need to get to work  after all  so i
squeezed my eyelids shut  trying to wake up  when suddenly i heard
a creak  i opened my eyes at once  she was sitting next to me on
the bed  staring at me gravely  i smiled at her and she smiled back
and leaned over me  the first kiss was a light one  like one small child
kissing another  i gave her a lingering kiss in return  can a dream be
exploited like that  i wondered  though its not even betraying her
memory  because after all it was she herself i was dreaming about 
this had never happened to me before      still we said nothing  i
lay on my back  when she raised her face i could see into her small
nostrils  lit by the sun from the direction of the window  which were
always a barometer of her feelings  i passed my fingertips over her
ears  whose lobes had turned pink from kisses  i dont know if that
was what unsettled me so  i kept telling myself it was a dream  but
my heart contracted 
    i gathered myself to jump out of bed  i was expecting not to
succeed  in dreams you often have no control over your own body 
which seems paralyzed or somehow absent  i was rather counting on
being woken up by the attempt  yet i didnt wake  i just sat up with
my legs hanging to the floor  nothing for it  id just have to dream
this dream to the end  i thought to myself  but my good mood had
vanished without a trace  i was afraid 
     what is it you want   i asked  my voice was hoarse and i had to
clear my throat 
    unthinkingly my bare feet sought my slippers and before i re 
membered i didnt have any slippers here  i stubbed my toe so hard i
winced  all right  now its going to come to an end  i thought gladly 
    but still nothing happened    had moved aside when i sat up 
she leaned back against the bedrail  her dress was trembling slightly
just beneath the tip of her left breast  to the rhythm of a beating
heart  she gazed at me with tranquil interest  it occurred to me that
the best thing would be to take a shower  but on second thought i
realized a dream shower wouldnt wake me up 
     where did you come from   i asked 
    she took hold of my hand and started tossing it up and down
the way she used to  knocking my fingertips up then catching hold of
them 
     i dont know   she said   is that bad  
    it was the same low voice  and the same absent minded tone 
she always spoke as if she was paying little attention to the words
she was uttering  as if she was already occupied with something else 
sometimes this made her seem giddy  sometimes shameless  because
she would stare at everything with a muted astonishment expressed
only in her eyes 
      has anyone      seen you  
      i dont know  i came here  thats all  does it matter     
     she was still playing with my hand  but her face was no longer
taking part in the game  she frowned 
         
      what is it  love  
      how did you know where i was  
     that made her think  when she smiled her lips were so dark
that when she ate sour cherries you couldnt tell she showed the
tips of her teeth 
      ive no idea  isnt that funny  you were asleep when i came in 
but i didnt wake you up  i tried not to  because you get grumpy 
grumpy and whiny   she said  bouncing my hand up energetically to
the rhythm of her words 
      were you down below  
      yes  i left its cold there  
     she let go of my hand  lying down  she tossed her head back
so all her hair spilled to one side  and she glanced at me with the
half smile that only had stopped irritating me when i fell in love with
her 
      but             but   i stammered 
     i leaned towards her and raised the short sleeve of her dress  just
above the flower shaped smallpox inoculation there was a tiny red
pinprick  though id suspected this  i was still instinctively seeking
scraps of logic among all the impossibilities   i suddenly felt faint 
i placed my finger on the injection mark  which id dreamed of for
years afterwards  i would wake up with a groan in crumpled bedding 
always in the same position  folded almost in two  the way she had
been lying when i found her almost completely cold because in my
dream id tried to do the same thing she had done  as if in this way
id been seeking her forgiveness or keeping her company in those last
minutes  when she could already feel the effects of the injection and
had begun to be afraid  after all  she was afraid even of an ordinary
cut  she never could stand pain or the sight of blood  and then all at
once shed gone and done such a terrible thing  leaving five words on
a note card addressed to me  i had it among my papers  i carried it
with me at all times  faded and falling apart at the folds  i lacked the
courage to part with it  a thousand times id returned to the moment
when she wrote it  and to what she must have been feeling then  i
tried to convince myself shed only meant to pretend to do it to scare
me  and it was just that the dose had accidentally proved too big 
everyone tried to tell me that was how it had been  or that it had
been a momentary decision brought on by sudden depression  but
they didnt know what i had said to her five days earlier  or that id
packed my things so as to hurt her as much as possible  and that as i
was getting everything together she had said entirely calmly   you do
know what this means          and id pretended i didnt understand 
though i understood perfectly well  its just that i thought she was a
coward  and i told her that as well  and now she was lying across my
bed and gazing at me as if she didnt know i had killed her 
     is that all you can manage   she asked  the room was red from
the sun  the glow smoldered in her hair  she looked at her own arm 
it had suddenly become important because id been staring at it  and
when i lowered my hand she placed a cool  soft cheek against it 
         i said hoarsely   this cant be      
     stop it  
    her eyes were closed  i could see them quivering under tightly
shut eyelids  her dark lashes touched her cheeks 
     where are we     
     at home  
     which is where  
    she opened one eye for a moment then shut it again immediately 
her eyelashes tickled my hand 
        
     what  
     i feel good  
    i sat over her without moving  i raised my head and in the mirror
over the washbasin i saw part of the bunk   s ruffled hair  and
my bare knees  with my foot i pulled up one of those half melted
tools lying around on the floor  and picked it up with my free hand 
its tip was sharp  i held it against my skin right above the place where
there was a pink  semi circular  symmetrical scar  and i pressed it into
my body  the pain was acute  i watched the blood flow in large drops
down the inside of my thigh and drip quietly onto the floor 
     it wasnt working  the terrible thoughts moving through my mind
were growing more and more distinct  id stopped saying  this is a
dream   id long stopped believing it  now i was thinking   i have to
protect myself   i glanced at her back  where it turned into the curve
of her hips beneath the white fabric  her bare feet dangled above the
floor  i reached toward them  gently took hold of her pink heel and
moved my fingers across the sole 
     it was soft as the skin of a new born baby 
     by now i pretty much knew it wasnt    and i was almost
certain she herself didnt know it 
     the bare foot twisted in my hand  and  s dark lips filled with
laughter without making a sound 
      stop it   she whispered 
     i eased my hand away and stood up  i was still naked  as i
dressed hurriedly i saw her sit on the bunk  she was watching me 
      where are your things   i asked  and regretted it immediately 
      my things  
      you mean you only have that dress  
     by this stage i was just putting on an act  i deliberately tried to
sound casual  ordinary  as if wed just parted the day before or  rather 
as if wed never parted at all  she stood up and with the light but firm
gesture i knew so well she brushed her dress to straighten it out  my
words had intrigued her  though she didnt say anything  for the first
time she took a long hard look at her surroundings  then she looked
back at me  visibly surprised 
      i dont know         she said helplessly   maybe in the locker  
she added and opened the door 
      no  theres nothing but overalls in there   i replied  i found an
electric razor by the washbasin and began shaving  as i did so i tried
not to stand with my back to the girl  whoever she was 
     she walked around the cabin  peering into every corner  looking
out of the window  in the end she came up to me and said 
         i have the feeling that something has happened  
     she broke off  i waited  the turned off razor in my hand 
      its as if id forgotten something      as if id forgotten a great
deal  i know      i only remember you      and      and nothing else  
     i listened  trying to control the look on my face 
      was i      sick  
      well      you could put it like that  yes  for a while you were a
bit sick  
      oh  then thats probably what it is  
     she was already in better spirits  i cant express what i was going
through  as she stood there silently  walked around  sat  smiled  the
feeling that this was   in front of me was stronger than my
churning fear  then at other moments  like the present one  it seemed
as if this was a simplified version of    reduced to a few distinctive
expressions  gestures  movements  she came close  rested her fists on
my chest by my neck and asked 
      how are things between us  good or bad  
      they couldnt be better   i replied 
     she gave a half smile 
      when you say that  it usually means theyre bad  
      not at all    darling  i have to go now   i said hurriedly   wait
for me here  ok  or maybe      are you hungry   i asked  because i
myself suddenly felt a growing hunger 
      hungry  no  
     she shook her head so hard it made her hair wave back and forth 
      should i wait here for you  will you be long  
      an hour tops   i began  but she interrupted 
      ill go with you  
      you cant go with me  i have work to get done  
      ill go with you  
     this was a completely different   the old one didnt intrude 
ever 
      it isnt possible  kid      
     she looked up at me  then all at once took me by the hand  i ran
my fingers up her forearm  the upper arm was full and warm  i hadnt
meant it but it was almost a caress  my body was acknowledging her 
wanting her  drawing me to her beyond reason  beyond argumentation
and fear 
     trying to remain calm come what may  i repeated 
         it isnt possible  you have to stay here  
      no  
     how strange it sounded 
      why  
      i d      i dont know  
     she looked around and raised her eyes to me again 
      i cant   she said as quiet as could be 
      but why   
      i dont know  i cant  i have the feeling that      the feeling that 
    
     she was evidently searching for the answer inside herself  and
when she found it  it was a discovery for her 
      i have the feeling that i always have to      be able to see you  
     her matter of fact tone prevented the words from being an ex 
pression of emotion  this was something quite different  it suddenly
altered the way i was holding her though on the outside there was
no change  i still had my arms around her  as i looked into her eyes
i began to push her arms backwards  this movement  not entirely
decisive to begin with  was already leading somewhere it had found
its purpose  i cast around with my eyes for something to tie her up
with 
     her elbows  twisted back  knocked lightly against each other and
at the same moment flexed with a strength that rendered my hold
ineffective  i struggled for perhaps one second  not even a wrestler
would have been able to get free if hed been bent over backwards
as   was  feet barely touching the floor  but she broke my grip 
straightened up and lowered her arms  while her face took no part in
any of this  bearing nothing but a faint  uncertain smile 
     her eyes observed me with the same calm interest as at the very
beginning  when i woke up  as if she was unaware of my desperate
exertions from a moment ago  brought on by an attack of anxiety 
shed become passive and seemed to be waiting for something 
simultaneously indifferent  intent  and a little take aback by it all 
     my arms dropped of their own accord  i left her in the middle of
the room and went up to the shelf by the washbasin  i felt caught in
an unimaginable trap  and i was looking for a way out  weighing ever
more ruthless options  if someone had asked what was happening
to me and what it all meant  i wouldnt have been able to respond
with a single word  but i was already becoming aware that what
was happening to all of us on the station constituted some kind of
whole  as dire as it was incomprehensible  yet this was not what i
was thinking about at the present moment  rather  i was looking for
some sort of trick  a maneuver that would make it possible for me to
escape  without looking  i could feel  s gaze on me  in a locker
over the shelf there was a small first aid box  i flipped through its
contents  i found a container of soluble sleeping tablets and put four
of them the maximum dose in a glass  i didnt even particularly
conceal what i was doing from her  i dont really know why  i didnt
think about it  i added hot water  waited till the tablets had dissolved 
and went up to    who was still standing in the middle of the
room 
      are you angry   she asked in a low voice 
      no  here  drink this  
     i dont know why id assumed she would do what i said  but sure
enough  she took the glass from me without a word and drank the
whole thing in one gulp  i set the empty glass aside on the table and
sat down in the corner between the locker and the bookshelves   
slowly came up to me and sat down on the floor by the armchair 
the way she often used to  folding her legs under her  and with an
equally familiar gesture she tossed her hair back  though i no longer
remotely believed it was her  every time i recognized her in these
small quirks my throat tightened  it was beyond understanding and
it was terrible  and the most terrible thing about it was that i myself
had to dissemble  pretending that i took her for    though after
all  she took herself for   too  and in her own reasoning she was
not being deceitful  i dont know how i concluded that this was the
case  but i was sure of it  insofar as anything could still be sure 
     i sat there  and the girl leaned back against my knees  her hair
tickling my motionless hand  we were almost completely still  a
couple of times i glanced at my watch  half an hour had passed and
the sleeping tablets ought to have started working    murmured
something faintly 
      what was that   i asked  but she didnt reply  i took this as a sign
she was growing sleepy  though truth be told  deep down i doubted
whether the medication would be effective  why  i dont know the
answer to that question either  probably because my ruse had been
only too simple 
     her head  swathed in dark hair  gradually sank onto my lap  she
was breathing regularly like a sleeping person  i leaned over to carry
her across to the bunk  suddenly  without opening her eyes she took
hold of my hair lightly and burst out in a strident laugh 
     i froze  while she was in fits of laughter  through eyes narrowed to
slits she studied me with a gaze that was at once naive and cunning 
i sat unnaturally stiffly  dazed and helpless    giggled one more
time  pressed her face into my arm and fell silent 
      what are you laughing about   i asked in a hollow voice  the
same expression of slightly uneasy puzzlement appeared on her face 
i knew she was trying to give a straight answer  she tapped her
diminutive nose and finally said with a sigh 
      i couldnt say myself  
     it sounded like genuine surprise 
      im behaving like an idiot  arent i   she continued   it just kind
of suddenly      but youre no one to talk  youre sitting there all sulky
like      like pelvis      
      like who   i asked  i thought id misheard 
      pelvis  you know  the fat guy      
     the thing was  beyond the shadow of a doubt   could not
have known pelvis or heard about him from me  for the simple reason
that hed come back from his mission a good three years after she
died  id never met him up till then  and i didnt know that when
he presided over institute meetings he had the annoying habit of
prolonging them into infinity  in fact his name was pelle villis  which
had been shortened to pelvis as a nickname  something i also didnt
know till he returned 
        leaned her elbows on my lap and looked into my face  i
placed my hands on her shoulders and slid them towards her back
till they almost met at the pulsing  bare base of her neck  the gesture
could actually have been taken for a caress  and judging from her
eyes she hadnt understood it any other way  in reality i was checking
that her body felt like ordinary  soft human flesh  and that beneath
her muscles there were bones and joints  as i gazed into her tranquil
eyes i had an awful urge to tighten my fingers abruptly 
      i was on the point of squeezing when i suddenly remembered
 s bloodied hands  and i let go of her 
       what a strange look you have in your eyes         she said evenly 
      my heart was pounding so hard i couldnt say a word  i closed
my eyes for a moment 
      all at once an entire course of action came to me  from beginning
to end  with all the details  without wasting a moment i stood up
from the armchair 
       i have to go now      i said   if you really want  you can
come with me  
       all right  
      she jumped to her feet 
       why are you barefoot   i asked  going up to the locker and
picking out two pairs of colored overalls for myself and for her 
       i dont know      i must have kicked my shoes off somewhere     
   she said hesitantly  i let it slide 
       you wont be able to put this on over your dress youll need to
take it off  
       overalls  what for   she asked  she immediately made to remove
her dress  but something very odd came to light  it couldnt be taken
off because there was no fastening  the red buttons down the middle
were only decoration  there was no zipper or any other kind of
fastener    gave an embarrassed smile  acting as if it were the
most natural thing in the world  i picked up a scalpel like tool from
the floor and cut the material in the middle of the neckline at the
back  now she could pull the dress over her head  the overalls were
a little too big for her 
      are we flying somewhere        but youre coming too   she
asked as we were leaving the cabin  both in our overalls now  i
merely nodded  i was terrified wed meet    but the corridor to
the docking bay was deserted  and the door to the radio station  which
we had to pass  was closed 
     a dead calm hung over the station    watched as i brought a
rocket from the middle cubicle on an electric cart and drove it onto
a free track  i checked in turn the microreactor  the remote con 
trolled rudders  and the nozzles  then along with the takeoff carriage
i wheeled the missile onto the circular roller surface of the launch
pad beneath the central funnel of the dome  having first removed the
empty capsule that was there 
     the rocket was a small vessel that served as a shuttle between the
station and the satelloid  it was used to transport cargo  not people 
barring exceptional circumstances  because it couldnt be opened from
inside  this happened to suit my purpose and was a part of my
plan  of course i had no intention of launching the rocket  but i
did everything the way i would if i were preparing it for an actual
takeoff     who had accompanied me so many times on my
travels  was somewhat familiar with it all  once again i checked the
air conditioning and the breathing apparatus inside and turned them
both on  then when i fired up the main circuit and the control lights
came on  i crawled out of the cramped interior and indicated it to
   who was standing by the access ladder 
      get in  
      what about you  
      ill follow you  i have to close the hatch behind us  
     i didnt think she could have seen through the deception ahead
of time  when she climbed the ladder and entered the vessel  i
immediately stuck my head through the hatch and asked if shed been
able to find a comfortable position  when i heard a muffled  yes 
from the cramped space  i stepped back and slammed the trapdoor
shut  with a flick of the hand i snapped the bolts shut as far as they
would go and with a wrench i had ready i started tightening the five
reinforcing screws set into wells in the plating 
    the sharpened cigar of the rocket stood upright as if it were
actually about to fly off into space  i knew nothing bad would happen
to the woman locked inside there was plenty of air  even some food 
and besides  i had no intention of imprisoning her in there forever 
    i wanted at any price to buy myself a few hours of freedom so i
could make plans for the less immediate future  and get in touch with
   now on an equal basis 
    as i was tightening the second to last screw i felt a slight shake
in the metal struts that held the rocket in place  suspended from
projections on three sides  but i thought i must have set the steel
mass atremble myself as i wielded the large wrench 
    yet when i took a few steps away i saw something i hope never
to see again 
    the whole rocket was juddering from a series of blows coming
from inside  but the strength of those blows      even if the slim dark 
haired girl inside the vessel had been replaced by a steel automat  it
wouldnt have been able to make the entire eight tons convulse in that
way 
    the reflections of the docking bay lights flickered and flashed in
the polished bodywork  in fact i didnt hear any knocking  inside
the projectile there was undisturbed quiet  but the broadly planted
stays of the scaffolding in which the rocket was suspended lost their
sharp outline  quivering like violin strings  the frequency of the
vibrations was such that i worried about the integrity of the plating 
with shaking hands i finished securing the last screw  tossed the
wrench aside and jumped down off the ladder  as i stepped slowly
backwards i could see the bolts in the shock absorbers  designed
only to withstand a constant pressure  bouncing in their mounts  i
had the impression the plating of the hull was losing its uniform
gleam  like a madman i rushed to the remote control console and
with both hands pushed the lever that started up the reactor and
the communications system  at that point  from the loudspeaker
now connected to the rockets interior there came a half whimper 
half whistle that was utterly unlike any human voice  despite which i
could make out in it a repeated howl             
     though actually i didnt hear it clearly  my knuckles were cut and
bleeding from the helter skelter of trying to launch the rocket  a pale
blue glow lit the walls  dust clouds burst from the launch pad beneath
the exhaust nozzles and turned into a pillar of toxic sparks  then a
sustained roar drowned out all other sounds  the rocket rose up on
three flames that instantly merged into a single column of fire  and
flew out through the open launch aperture  leaving trembling layers of
heat behind  the aperture closed up immediately  and automatically
activated compressors began flushing clean air into the bay  which was
filled with swirling clouds of acrid smoke  i was completely oblivious
to all this  my hands gripping the console  my face still smarting
with living fire  my hair curled and scorched from the thermic blast  i
was gasping for breath  the air was filled with the stench of burning
and the smell of ionization  unmistakable as ozone  though at the
moment of liftoff id closed my eyes instinctively  id still been struck
by the exhaust flame  for a good while i could see nothing but black 
red  and gold rings  gradually they dissipated  the smoke  dust  and
fog thinned  drawn into the perpetually moaning ventilation ducts 
the first thing i saw was the greenish glow of the radar screen  i
started maneuvering the directional reflector  looking for the rocket 
when i found it  it was already above the atmosphere  id never in my
life sent up a projectile in such a mad  blind fashion  with no idea
what acceleration to give it or even where to send it  it occurred to
me that the simplest thing would be to put it in orbit around solaris 
at an altitude of six hundred miles or so  because then i could turn off
the engines if they were left on too long  i thought it might lead to
a disaster that could have unpredictable consequences  i ascertained
from the tables that a six hundred mile orbit was stationary  it didnt
guarantee anything  true  but it was the only solution i could see 
     i had switched the loudspeaker off right after takeoff  and i lacked
the courage to turn it back on  i would have done virtually anything
not to have to hear again that terrible voice  which carried no vestige
of anything human  this much i could say all appearances had been
smashed  and from under the appearance of  s face another 
truer face had begun to show  compared to which the alternative of
madness was truly becoming a liberation 
     it was one oclock when i left the docking bay
