At nineteen hundred hours ships time I climbed down the metal
ladder past the bays on either side into the capsule  Inside  there was
just enough room to raise my elbows  After I attached the end of the
cables into the port jutting from the side of the capsule  my space
suit filled with air and from that point on I couldnt make the slightest
movement  I stood  or rather hung suspended  in a bed of air  all of
one piece with my metal shell 
    Raising my eyes through the convex porthole I could see the walls
of the bay and  higher up  leaning in  Moddards face  It quickly
disappeared and everything went dark as the heavy protective cone
was put in place from above  I heard the eight times repeated whirr
of the electric motors tightening the screws  Then the hiss of air
entering the shock absorbers  My eyes were getting using to the dark 
I could already make out the pale green shape of the only gauge 
     Ready  Kelvin   I heard in my headset 
     Ready  Moddard   I replied 
     Dont worry about a thing  The Stationll bring you in   he said 
 Bon voyage  
    Before I could answer  there was a rasping sound overhead and
the capsule shook  I tensed my muscles instinctively  but nothing else
happened 
     When do I take off   I asked  hearing a rustling noise like fine
grains of sand falling on a diaphragm 

      Youre already in flight  Kelvin  Be well   came Moddards voice
in my ear  Before I believed it  a broad gap opened up in front of my
face  through which I could see stars  I tried in vain to spot Alpha
Aquarii  towards which the Prometheus was now headed  The sky in
this part of the Galaxy meant nothing to me  I didnt know a single
constellation  and all I saw through the porthole was glittering dust 
I waited for the stars to start smoking  I didnt get to see it  They
merely began to fade and disappear  dissolving against a reddening
background  I realized I was in the upper strata of the atmosphere 
Stiff in my cocoon of pneumatic cushions  all I could do was look
straight ahead  There was still no horizon  I flew on  not feeling
any movement  but slowly and insidiously my body grew hotter and
hotter  Outside there arose a soft penetrating twitter like the sound
of metal against wet glass  If it werent for the numbers flashing on
the gauge I wouldnt have been aware of the speed of my descent 
The stars were gone  The porthole was filled with a ruddy colored
brightness  I could hear the heavy beat of my own pulse  My face
burned  on my neck I felt cold blowing from the air conditioning  I
regretted not having managed to see the Prometheus it must have
been out of sight by the time the porthole automatically opened 
     The capsule shuddered once and twice  vibrated in a disagreeable
way  the shaking passed through all the layers of insulation and cush 
ions and entered deep into my body  The green face of the gauge
grew hazy  I stared at it without being afraid  I hadnt come all this
way only to perish at my destination 
      Come in  Solaris Station   I said   Solaris Station  Solaris Station 
You need to do something  I think Im destabilizing  Solaris Station 
this is newcomer  Over  
     And once again Id missed the crucial moment when the planet
came into view  It extended vast and flat  from the size of the streaks
on its surface I could tell I was still a long way off  Or rather  a
long way up  since Id already passed that intangible boundary where
distance from a celestial body becomes altitude  I was descending 
Still descending  I could feel it now  even when I closed my eyes  I
opened them at once  because I wanted to see as much as possible 
     I waited out a minute or so of silence then called again  I received no response this time either  Crackling volleys of static repeated in
my headphones  against the background of a hum so deep and low
it seemed to be the voice of the planet itself  The orange sky in the
spy hole covered over with a film  The glass darkened  I flinched
involuntarily  insofar as the pneumatic swathes permitted it  Then 
a moment later  I realized these were clouds  A whole host of them
moved abruptly upwards as if blown  I was still flying  now in sunlight 
now in shadow  because the capsule was turning on its vertical axis
and the huge  swollen looking face of the sun was passing smoothly
across my eyes  appearing on the left and setting on the right  All at
once  through the crackle and the hum  a distant voice began talking
right in my ear 
     Solaris Station to newcomer  Solaris Station to newcomer  AOK 
Newcomer is under control of the Station  Solaris Station to new 
comer  prepare for docking at zero hour  Attention  commencing
countdown  Two hundred fifty  two hundred forty nine  two hundred
forty eight      
    The individual words were separated by split second mewing noises
that showed it was not a human talking  That was strange  to say the
least  Usually  every living soul would run to the docking bay when
someone new was arriving  especially someone directly from Earth  I
didnt have time to think about it  however  because the huge circle
that the sun had been turning around me stood on end along with
the plain towards which I was dropping  After this movement there
came another in the opposite direction  I was rocking like the bob of
a huge pendulum  fighting back dizziness  Against the expanse of the
planet rising vertically like a wall  striped with dirty lilac colored and
blackish streaks  I spotted a fine checkerboard of white and green dots
that marked the location of the Station  At the same time  something
detached with a snap from the exterior of the capsule the long neck 
lace of an annular parachute  which flapped abruptly  In this noise
there was something unutterably terrestrial after so many months 
the first real sound of wind 
    Everything began to happen very quickly  Up till now Id only
known that I was falling  Now I could see it  The white and green
checkerboard was getting rapidly bigger  I could already see it was painted on an elongated  whale shaped hull glistening silver  with the
needles of radio antenna protruding from its sides  and rows of darker
window openings  this metal colossus wasnt resting on the surface
of the planet but was suspended above it  its shadow moving across
an inky background in the form of an elliptical patch of even more
intense blackness  Simultaneously I noticed the violet flushed furrows
of the ocean  which betrayed a faint motion  the clouds suddenly rose
high up  their edges marked with dazzling crimson  the sky between
them grew distant and flat  dull orange in color  and everything be 
came blurred  Id entered a spin  Before I could utter a word  a brief
impact returned the capsule to a horizontal position  and the ocean 
glittering with a mercuric light to the very limits of the horizon  ap 
peared in the spy hole  The droning cords and rings of the parachute
suddenly detached and flew off over the waves  carried by the wind 
the capsule rocked softly with that particular slowed down motion
characteristic of an artificial force field  and moved downward  The
last thing I was able to see were lattice work flight catapults and
the grids of two radio telescope dishes that looked to be several sto 
ries high  Something immobilized the capsule with a terrifying noise
of steel striking firmly against steel  Something opened up beneath
me  and the metal shell in which Id been rigidly encased ended its
hundred and ten mile journey with a prolonged wheezing sigh 
      Solaris Station  Zero and zero  Docking complete  Over and out  
came the lifeless voice of the control mechanism  With both hands
 I could sense a vague pressure on my chest  and my innards felt
like an irksome burden  I took hold of the grips directly opposite my
shoulders and disconnected the cables  A green sign reading EARTH
came on  and the side of the capsule opened  The pneumatic berth
pushed me gently in the back  so that in order not to stumble I had
to take a step forward 
     With a soft hiss like a resigned sigh the air left the coils of the
space suit  I was free 
     I stood beneath a silver funnel high as a nave  Bundles of colored
pipes led down the walls  disappearing into circular wells  I turned
around  The ventilation shafts were roaring  drawing in what was left
of the poisonous atmosphere of the planet that had gotten in during the docking  The cigar of the capsule  empty as a burst cocoon 
stood in a concavity set into a steel platform  Its external plating had
been scorched to a dirty brown color  I walked down the short ramp 
Beyond it  a layer of rough plastic had been welded to the metal
deck  It had worn away in places from the wheels of the mobile
rocket jacks  The air conditioning compressors suddenly went off and
there was complete silence  I looked around somewhat helplessly 
Id expected someone to appear  but nobody had come  There was
nothing but a glowing neon arrow indicating a soundless moving
walkway  I stepped onto it  The ceiling of the hangar curved down in
an elegant parabola that became the tube of a corridor  In its alcoves
there were heaps of pressurized gas cylinders  containers  annular
parachutes  crates  all in disorderly piles  any old how  That made me
think  too  The walkway ended at a point where the corridor widened
into a circular space  Here there was an even bigger jumble  Under
a mound of metal canisters an oily fluid had leaked and formed a
puddle  A strong  unpleasant odor filled the air  Boot prints marked
clearly in the sticky substance led in different directions  Among the
cans lay rolls of white telegraph tape  torn papers  and trash  all of
which looked as if it had been swept out of the cabins  And there
was another illuminated sign directing me to the middle door  It led
to a corridor so narrow that two people could barely have passed one
another  Light came from high placed windows with biconvex panes
directed at the sky  There was another door  painted with a green 
and white checkerboard  It was ajar  I entered  The semi spherical
cabin had one large panoramic window in which the mist covered
sky was aglow  Down below  the blackish hills of the waves moved
soundlessly  There were numerous open cabinets around the walls 
They were filled with technical instruments  books  glasses with a
dried residue at the bottom  dust covered thermos flasks  Around the
dirty floor there were five or six mechanical tables on wheels  and
among them several armchairs that were deflated and sagging  Only
one was blown up  its backrest leaning to the rear  In it sat a small 
scrawny man with a sunburned face  The skin was peeling from his
nose and cheekbones  I knew who he was  It was Snaut  Gibarians
second in command  a cybernetician  In his time hed published a number of highly original articles in the Journal of Solaristics  Id
never met him in person before  He was wearing a mesh shirt  tufts
of gray hair on his flat chest poking through  and once white linen
pants with multiple pockets like a mechanics  stained at the knees
and burned from reagents  He was holding a plastic bulb of the kind
used to drink out of on ships that lack artificial gravity  He looked
at me as if hed been dazzled by a blinding light  The bulb fell from
his fingers as they unclenched  and bounced a couple of times on the
floor like a ball  A splash of clear liquid spilled from it  The blood
drained slowly from his face  I was too taken aback to say anything 
and this wordless scene continued until in some mysterious way his
fear was transferred to me  I took a step forward  He shrank into his
armchair 
     Snaut   I whispered  He winced as if hed been struck  Staring at
me with inexpressible aversion  he said hoarsely 
     I dont know you  I dont know you  what do you want        
    The spilled liquid evaporated quickly  I caught the smell of alco 
hol  Was he drinking  Drunk  But why was he so afraid  I was still
standing in the middle of the cabin  My knees were wobbly  and my
ears felt like theyd been stopped up with cotton wool  The pressure
of the floor beneath my feet still didnt seem entirely reliable  Out 
side the convex window the ocean was moving evenly  Snaut kept
his bloodshot eyes on me  The fear was leaving his face  but the
unutterable disgust remained 
     Whats wrong with you   I asked in a murmur   Are you sick  
     Youre concerned         he said in a hollow voice   Aha  So youre
going to be concerned  But why about me  I dont know you  
     Wheres Gibarian   I asked  For a moment he held his breath  his
eyes glassed over  something lit up in them and went out again 
     Gib      Gibar      no  no   
    He shook with soundless  idiotic laughter  then abruptly fell silent 
     Youve come to see Gibarian         he said almost calmly 
 Gibarian  What do you mean to do with him  
    He was looking at me as if all at once Id ceased to be a threat to
him  in his words  and even more in their tone  there was something
hateful and offensive 
      What are you talking about   I stammered  feeling dazed   Where
is he  
     He was stunned 
      You dont know        
     Hes drunk  I thought to myself  Drunk to the point of uncon 
sciousness  I was growing increasingly angry  I really ought to have
left  but I ran out of patience 
      Get a grip on yourself   I roared   How am I supposed to know
when I just flew in a moment ago  Whats the matter with you  Snaut   
     His jaw dropped  Once again he held his breath for a second 
but in a different way  and a sudden glint appeared in his eye  He
gripped the armrests of the chair with trembling hands and stood up
with difficulty  his joints cracking 
      What   he said  almost soberly   You flew in  From where  
      From Earth   I replied  furious   Maybe youve heard of it  Though
it doesnt look that way  
      From Ear      Good grief      So youre      Kelvin   
      Thats right  Why are you looking at me that way  Whats strange
about that  
      Nothing   he said  blinking rapidly   Nothing  
     He wiped his forehead 
      Kelvin  Im sorry  its nothing  you know  just the surprise  I wasnt
expecting you  
      What do you mean  you werent expecting me  You were in 
formed months ago  and Moddard telegraphed today  from the Prometheus 
    
      Right  Right      No doubt  Its just that here  as you can see 
theres a certain amount of      confusion  
      No kidding   I retorted drily   Its hard not to notice  
     Snaut walked around me as if he wanted to check out the look of
my space suit  which was the most ordinary kind  with its harness of
pipes and cables on the chest  He gave a series of coughs  He rubbed
his bony nose 
      Maybe youd like to take a shower        Itll do you good  Its the
blue door across the way  
      Thanks  I know the layout of the Station  
      Are you hungry maybe        
      No  Wheres Gibarian  
     He went up to the window as if he hadnt heard my question 
With his back turned he looked much older  His close cut hair was
gray  the back of his neck  burned by the sun  was crisscrossed with
wrinkles deep as cuts  Outside the window the crests of the waves
glistened  rising and falling so slowly it seemed as if the ocean was
congealing  Looking down there I had the impression the Station was
moving imperceptibly sideways  as if it were slipping off an invisible
base  Then it returned to equilibrium and tipped lazily in the other
direction  But it was probably an illusion  Stretches of slimy foam
the color of bone were gathering in the troughs between the waves 
For a split second I felt a twinge of nausea in the pit of my stomach 
The cold orderliness of the Prometheus now seemed to me something
precious and irrevocably lost 
      Listen   Snaut said unexpectedly   For the moment its just me 
     He turned around and rubbed his hands nervously   Youll have
to be content with my company  For now  Call me Rat  You only
know me from photographs  but it doesnt matter  everyone uses that
name  Nothing to be done about it  Im afraid  Besides  when you
have parents with such cosmic aspirations as mine  even Rat starts to
sound OK      
      Wheres Gibarian   I asked again insistently  He blinked 
      Im sorry I greeted you like that  Its      not entirely my fault  Id
completely forgotten  theres been a lot going on here  you know      
      All right   I replied   Never mind that  So whats with Gibarian  Is
he not on the Station  Did he fly somewhere  
      No   came the answer  He looked into the corner of the cabin 
which was hidden behind a pile of coiled cables   He didnt fly
anywhere  And hes not going to  Precisely because of that      among
other things      
      What   I asked  My ears were still blocked and I had the feeling
I wasnt hearing right   Whats that supposed to mean  Where is he  
      Come on  you know   he said in a completely different tone of
voice  He looked me in the eye so coldly it gave me gooseflesh  He
may have been drunk  but he knew what he was saying 
     Surely hes not        
     Yes  
     An accident  
    He nodded  He wasnt just confirming  he was also sanctioning
my reaction 
     When  
     Today  at dawn  
    Strange to relate  I didnt feel shock  This entire short exchange
of monosyllabic question and answer rather calmed me by its matter 
of factness  I felt I now understood his previously unaccountable
behavior 
     How  
     Go get changed  settle in and come back here in  lets say  an
hour  
    I hesitated a moment 
     Fine  
     Wait   he said  as I was turning to the door  He gave me a
peculiar look  I could see that what he wanted to say stuck in his
throat 
     There were three of us and now  with you  there are three again 
Do you know Sartorius  
     Like I know you  from pictures  
     Hes in the lab upstairs  I doubt hell come out before nightfall 
but      in any case youll recognize him  If you should see anyone
else  you understand  not me or Sartorius  you understand  then      
     Then what  
    I wasnt sure if I was dreaming  Against the background of the
black waves glinting bloodily in the low sun  he sat back in the arm 
chair  his head drooping as before  and stared to the side  at the reels
of cable 
     Then      dont do anything  
     Who might I see  A ghost   I exclaimed 
     I get it  You think Ive gone crazy  No  I havent gone crazy  I
dont know any other way to tell you      for the moment  Besides 
    maybe nothingll happen  In any case  remember  Youve been
warned  
 
     About what   What are you on about  
     Stay calm   he persisted   Act as if      Be prepared for anything 
Thats impossible  I know  But try anyhow  Its the only way  I dont
know any other  
     But WHAT am I going to see    I almost shouted  I barely kept
myself from grabbing him by the shoulders and giving him a good
shake as he sat there staring into the corner  with his tired sunburned
face  every word he uttered costing a visible effort 
     I dont know  In a certain sense it depends on you  
     Hallucinations  
     No  Its real  Dont      attack  Remember  
     What are you talking about   I said in a voice not my own 
     Were not on Earth  
     Polytheria  But they dont look anything like humans   I burst
out  I didnt know what to do to make him snap out of his trance  in
which he seemed to be reading something so senseless it chilled the
blood in his veins 
     Thats exactly why its so terrible   he said quietly   Remember 
be on your guard  
     What happened to Gibarian  
    He didnt answer 
     Whats Sartorius doing  
     Come back in an hour  
    I turned and left  As I opened the door I looked at him one more
time  He sat with his face in his hands  small  shrunken  in stained
pants  It was only now that I noticed he had dried blood on the
knuckles of both hands
