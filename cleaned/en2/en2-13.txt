the following three weeks were like the same day repeating itself 
never changing  the window shades rose and fell  in the night i
crawled from one nightmare to another  in the morning we got up
and the game began again  though was it in fact a game  i pretended
to be calm and so did harey  this silent pact  the knowledge of our
mutual deception  became our ultimate recourse  because we talked
a lot about how we were going to live on earth  how wed settle some 
where on the outskirts of a big city and never again leave the blue sky
and green trees  and together we dreamed up the interior of our fu 
ture home  and what our yard would look like  we even argued about
details      the hedge  the bench      did i believe in it all even for a
second  no  i knew it was impossible  i knew that  because even if
she were able to leave the station alive still  its only humans that
can land on earth  and humans are defined by their papers  the first
control would put an end to that escape  theyd want to identify her 
so first of all theyd separate us and that would give her away  the
station was the only place where we could live together  did harey
know that  for sure  had someone told her  in light of everything
that happened  probably so 
     one night  through my sleep i heard harey quietly get up  i tried
to pull her back  only by being silent  only in the darkness could we
still become free for a short while  only in brief periods of distraction
that the despair besieging us on every side turned into merely a
momentary suspension of the torment  i dont think shed noticed
that i was awake  before i stretched out my hand shed slipped out of
bed  still only half conscious  i heard the sound of bare feet  i was
overcome by a vague anxiety 
      harey   i whispered  i wanted to call out  but i didnt dare  i sat
up in bed  the door to the corridor was ajar  a thin strip of light
cut diagonally across the cabin  i thought i could hear muffled voices 
she was talking with someone  who 
     i jumped out of bed  but i was overcome by such a terrible fear
that my legs refused to obey me  i stood listening for a moment 
everything was quiet  i dragged myself back to the bunk  my head
was pounding  i started counting  at one thousand i broke off  the
door opened soundlessly  harey crept into the cabin and paused  as
if listening for my breathing  i tried to make it even   kris         she
whispered softly  i didnt respond  she got quickly into bed  i could
feel her lying there stretched out  while i lay next to her  immobile 
for i dont know how long  i tried to formulate questions  but the
more time passed  the more i realized i wouldnt be the first one to
break the silence  after some time  an hour perhaps  i fell asleep 
     the morning began the same as always  i cast suspicious glances
at her only when she wasnt looking  after lunch we sat side by side
in front of the bay window  where low ruddy clouds could be seen
drifting past  the station moved amongst them like a sailing ship 
harey was reading a book  while i was gazing in a manner that of
late had become my only respite  i noticed that if i leaned my head
a certain way i could see both of us reflected in the pane  the image
transparent but clear  i took my hand off the arm of my chair  in
the window i saw harey  glancing to check i was staring at the ocean 
lean over the arm and press her lips to the place id been touching a
moment before  i remained seated  unnaturally stiff  while she bowed
her head over her book again 
      harey   i said softly   where did you go in the night  
      in the night  
      yes  
      you      you probably dreamed it  kris  i didnt go anywhere  
      you didnt go anywhere  
      no  you must have been dreaming it  
      maybe   i said   yeah  its possible i dreamed it      
     that evening  when we were already getting ready for bed  i started
talking again about our voyage together  about our return to earth 
      i dont want to listen to all that   she said   stop it  kris  i mean 
you know      
      what  
      no  nothing  
     when we were already in bed  she said she wanted a drink 
      theres a glass of juice on the table over there  can you pass me
it  
     she drank half and gave it to me  i wasnt thirsty 
      drink to my health   she said with a smile  i finished the juice 
which tasted a little salty to me  though i didnt give it a second
thought 
      if you dont want to talk about earth  what do you want to talk
about   i asked after she turned the light out 
      would you get married if i wasnt in the picture  
      no  
      never  
      never  
      why not  
      i dont know  i was on my own for ten years and i didnt marry 
lets not talk about that  darling      
     my head was buzzing as if id drunk a bottle of wine or more 
      no  lets talk about it  lets talk about that  what if i asked you
to  
      to get married  thats nonsense  harey  i dont need anyone but
you  
     she leaned over me  i felt her breath on my mouth  she took hold
of me so firmly that for a brief second the overpowering drowsiness i
was feeling was dispelled 
      say it a different way  
      i love you  
     her forehead rested against my shoulder  i felt the tense flutter of
her eyelashes and the wetness of tears 
      harey  what is it  
      nothing  nothing  nothing   she repeated ever more quietly  i
strove to keep my eyes open  but they were closing of their own
accord  i dont know when i fell asleep 
     i was woken by the red dawn  my head was leaden and my neck
stiff  as if all the vertebrae had fused into a single bone  my tongue
felt rough  repulsive  and i couldnt move it in my mouth  i must have
eaten something bad  i thought to myself  lifting my head with an
effort  i reached out my hand to harey  it encountered cold bedding 
     i jerked upright 
     the bed was empty  and no one was in the cabin  the sun was
reflected in multiple red disks in the windows  i jumped to the floor 
i must have looked comical  i staggered like a drunk  i held onto
the furniture  grabbed hold of the locker  there was no one in the
bathroom  or the corridor  or in the workshop either 
      harey    i shouted  standing in the middle of the corridor and
flailing my arms wildly   harey   i croaked one more time  i already
knew 
     i dont remember exactly what happened next  i must have run
half naked around the entire station  i remember i even burst into the
cold room  then the last depository  where i hammered on the closed
door with my fists  i may even have been there more than once 
the stairs echoed  i fell over  jumped up  hurtled off somewhere else 
till i came to the transparent bulkhead beyond which was the hatch
to the outside a double reinforced door  i pushed against it with
all my strength and shouted  wanting all this to be a dream  and
someone had been with me for some time and was tugging at me 
pulling me somewhere  then i was in the small workshop  my shirt
wet with icy water  my hair bedraggled  my nostrils and tongue were
stinging from surgical spirit  i was half lying on something cold and
metallic  and snaut in his stained linen pants was bustling about by
the medicine cabinet  tipping something over  the implements and
glassware making a fearful clatter 
     all at once i saw him in front of me  he was staring into my eyes 
hunched over and intent 
      where is she  
     shes gone  
     but  but harey      
     hareys gone   he said slowly and distinctly  bringing his face
close to mine as if hed delivered a blow and was now observing its
effect on me 
     shell come back   i whispered  closing my eyes  and for the first
time i was truly not afraid of it  id lost my fear of her ghostly return 
i couldnt understand how id once been so frightened of it 
     drink this  
    he handed me a glass of warm liquid  i looked at it  then all of
a sudden flung the contents in his face  he took a step back  wiping
his eyes  when he opened them again i was standing over him  he
was tiny 
     it was you   
     what are you talking about  
     dont lie  you know what i mean  it was you talking with her the
other night  you made her give me a sleeping draft for the       
what have you done with her  tell me   
    he felt in his breast pockets and took out a crumpled envelope 
i snatched it from him  it was sealed  there was nothing written
on the outside  i tore it open  a sheet of paper folded in four fell
out  large  rather childlike handwriting in uneven lines  i recognized
whose it was 

      darling  it was me who asked him to do it  hes a good
      man  its awful that i had to deceive you  but there was no
      other way  i ask one thing of you listen to him and dont
      hurt yourself  you were wonderful 

    at the bottom there was one word that had been crossed out  i
managed to make it out  shed written  harey   then erased it  there
was one other letter  that looked like an h or a k  which had been
turned into a blot  i read it again  and one more time  then yet again 
by now my head had cleared too much for me to get hysterical  i
couldnt even manage a groan  i could barely speak 
     how   i whispered    how  
     later  kelvin  keep it together  
     i am  tell me  how  
     the annihilator  
     what do you mean  what about the apparatus   i asked with a
start 
     the roche machine was no use  sartorius built another special
destabilizer  a small one  it only operates over a range of a few
yards  
     what happened to her        
     she disappeared  there was a flash and a puff of wind  a faint
puff  nothing more  
     over a short range  you say  
     right  we didnt have the materials for anything bigger  
    suddenly the walls began to lean in on me  i closed my eyes 
     lord      she      but shell come back      
     no  
     what do you mean  no  
     no  kelvin  you remember the rising foam  since that time they
havent come back any more  
     they havent  
     no  
     you killed her   i said quietly 
     yes  would you not have done so  in my place  
    i jumped to my feet and set off walking faster and faster  from
the wall to the corner and back again  nine paces  turn  nine paces 
    i came to a halt in front of him 
     listen  well submit a report  well demand direct communication
with the board  it can be done  theyll agree  they have to  the
planetll be excluded from the convention of the four  all means
will be permissible  well bring in antimatter generators  you think
anything can resist antimatter  nothing can  nothing  nothing   i
was shouting exultantly  blinded by tears 
     you want to destroy it   he said   what for  
     go away  leave me alone  
     im not going  
     snaut  
     he looked into my eyes   no   he said with a shake of the head 
      what do you want  what do you want from me  
     he retreated to the table 
      all right  well submit a report  
     i turned around and began pacing again 
      sit down  
      get off my back  
      there are two matters  the first are the facts  the second are
our demands  
      you want to talk about that now  
      yes  now  
      i wont  understand  i dont care about any of that  
      the last communique we sent was before gibarian died  that
was over two months ago  we need to establish the exact sequence
of events surrounding the appearance of  
      will you not stop   i grabbed his arm 
      you can beat me if you want   he said   im still going to talk  
     i let go of him 
      do whatever you want  
      the point is  sartorius will try and conceal certain facts  im
almost certain of it  
      and you wont  
      no  not any more  this isnt just about us  its about you
know what its about  it demonstrated rational activity  a capacity for
organic synthesis of the highest order  something quite unknown to
us  it knows the composition  the microstructure  the metabolism of
our bodies      
      fine   i said   why stop there  it performed a series of     
experiments on us  a mental vivisection  based on knowledge stolen
from our heads  and paying no attention to our own purposes  
      those arent facts  theyre not even inferences  kelvin  theyre
hypotheses  in a certain sense it did pay attention to what was desired
by a closed  hidden part of our minds  these could have been gifts 
    
      gifts  dear god  
     i burst out laughing 
      stop it   he exclaimed  gripping my hand  i squeezed his fingers 
pressing harder and harder till his knuckles crunched  he was looking
at me through narrowed eyes  without wavering  i let go of him and
moved off into the corner  standing with my face to the wall  i said 
      ill try not to be too hysterical  
      never mind all that  what are we going to ask for  
      you decide  i cant  not right now  did she say anything before   
    
      no  nothing  as for me  i believe an opportunity has arisen  
      an opportunity  what opportunity  for what  oh   i said more
quietly  looking him in the eye  because id suddenly gotten it   con 
tact  were back with contact  havent we had too much already     
you also  you yourself  and this whole madhouse      contact  no no
no  count me out  
      why   he asked  completely calm   kelvin  you keep insisting on
treating it as a person  now more than ever  you hate it  
      and you dont   i snapped 
      no  kelvin  come on  its blind      
      blind   i repeated  unsure whether id heard right 
      of course  in our understanding of the word  we dont exist for
it the way we do for each other  the surface of the face  of the body 
which we see  means we encounter one another as individuals  for
it  this is only a transparent screen  after all  it penetrated the inside
of our brains  
      all right  but what of it  what are you getting at  if it was able
to create a person who didnt exist outside of my memory  bring her
to life  and in such a way that her eyes  her movements  her voice     
her voice      
      keep talking  keep talking  man   
      i am talking      i am      yes  so then      her voice      this
means it can read us like a book  you know what im saying  
      yes  that if it wanted to  it could communicate with us  
      of course  is that not obvious  
      no  not in the slightest  it could simply have taken a procedure
that didnt consist of words  as a fixed memory trace its a protein
structure  like the head of a spermatozoon  or an ovum  after all  in
the brain there arent any words  feelings  the recollection of a person
is an image written in the language of nucleic acids on megamolecular
asynchronous crystals  so it took what was most clearly etched in us 
most locked away  fullest  most deeply imprinted  you know  but it
had no need whatsoever to know what the thing was to us  what
meaning it held  just as if we were able to create a symmetriad and
toss it into the ocean  knowing the architecture and the technology
and structural materials  but with no understanding of what its for 
what it means to the ocean      
     quite possibly   i said   yes  thats possible  in such a case it had
no      perhaps it had no intention of trampling on us and crushing
us the way it did  perhaps  and it only unintentionally      
    my lips began to tremble 
     kelvin  
     i know  i know  its fine  its nothing  youre a good man  its
good too  everyones good  but what for  explain it to me  what for 
why did it do it  what did you tell her  
     the truth  
     the truth  the truth  but what  
     you know  come to my room now  we can write the report 
come on  
     wait a moment  what are you really after  surely youre not
planning to remain on the station        
     i want to stay here  yes
