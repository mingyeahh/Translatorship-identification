i hurriedly folded gibarians notes in four and stuck them in my
pocket  i went slowly up to the locker and looked inside  the overalls
and other clothing were squashed into a corner  as if someone had
been standing in there  the corner of an envelope was poking out
from under a pile of papers on the floor  i picked it up  it was
addressed to me  my heart suddenly in my throat  i ripped the
envelope open and had to force myself to unfold the small sheet of
paper that was inside 
    in his even  tiny but legible handwriting gibarian had noted 
    yearbook of solaristics volume i  appendix  also  minority report
by messenger re  f  ravintzers minor apocrypha 
    that was all  not one word more  the writing showed signs of
haste  was this some kind of important information  when had he
written it  i realized i needed to get to the library as soon as possible 
i knew the appendix to the first volume of the yearbook of solaristics 
that is to say  i knew of its existence  but id never had it in my hand 
for it was of historical interest only  ravintzer  on the other hand  and
his minor apocrypha  i had never even heard of 
    what should i do 
    i was already fifteen minutes late  one more time  from the door i
took in the whole room  it was only now that i noticed a folding bunk
stowed vertically against the wall it was hidden by a map of solaris 
something had been hung behind the map  it was a miniature tape
recorder in a case  i took out the recorder and returned the case to
where it had been before  i checked the counter almost an entire
reel had been used up  i slipped the recorder into my pocket 
     once again  for a second i stood by the door  my eyes closed 
listening intently to the silence that reigned outside  nothing  i
opened the door  the corridor looked like a black chasm  it was only
when i took off the dark glasses that i saw the faint ceiling lighting  i
closed the door behind me and set off left  to the radio station 
     i was close to the circular chamber from which corridors branched
off like the spokes of a wheel  as i was passing a narrow side hallway
leading  i think  to the bathrooms  i caught sight of a large  indistinct
figure that almost merged into the background 
     i stood rooted to the ground  from the far end of the side passage
a huge black woman was coming towards me with an unhurried
waddling gait  i saw the whites of her eyes glinting and at almost
exactly the same moment i heard the soft slap of her bare feet  she
had nothing on but a skirt that glistened yellow  as if it were made of
straw  she had massive pendulous breasts  and her black arms were
as thick as a normal persons thighs  she passed three feet from me
without so much as a glance and walked off  her elephantine rump
swaying like one of those steatopygic stone age sculptures found in
anthropological museums  at the place where the corridor curved 
she turned to the side and disappeared into gibarians cabin  when
she opened the door  for a split second she stood in the brighter light
coming from inside  then the door closed softly and i was on my
own  i took my left wrist in my right hand and squeezed with all my
might  till the bones cracked  i looked around distractedly  what had
just happened  what had that been  all at once  as if id been struck 
i recalled snauts warning  what was it supposed to mean  who had
that monstrous aphrodite been  where had she come from  i took
one  only one  step towards gibarians cabin  and froze  i knew only
too well i wasnt going to go in there  i sniffed the air with flared
nostrils  something was wrong  something was out of place  that was
it  id instinctively expected the distinct  repulsive odor of her sweat 
but even when she passed a couple of feet from me i hadnt smelled
a thing 
    i dont know how long i stood there leaning against the cold metal
wall  the station was plunged in silence  the only audible sound the
distant drone of the air conditioning compressors 
    i slapped myself lightly in the face and slowly made my way to
the radio station  when i pressed down on the door handle  i heard
a voice say sharply 
     whos there  
     its me  kelvin  
    he was sitting at a table between a pile of aluminum crates and
the transmission console  eating meat concentrate straight from the
can  i dont know why hed chosen to set up quarters in the radio
station  i stood at the door  dazed  staring at his regularly chewing
jaws  and suddenly realized i was hungry  i went up to the shelves 
took the least dusty plate from a pile and sat down opposite him  for
some time we ate without speaking  then snaut stood up  took a
thermos flask from a wall cabinet and poured us each a cup of hot
bouillon  putting the thermos down on the floor  as there was no
room on the table  he asked 
     have you seen sartorius  
     no  where is he  
     upstairs  
    upstairs was the laboratory  we continued eating in silence  till
the metal scraped at the bottom of the empty can  night reigned in
the radio station  the window was tightly covered from the outside 
the room was lit by four circular fluorescent ceiling lamps  their
reflections quivered in the plastic cover of the console 
    red capillaries marked the taut skin on snauts cheekbones  now
he was wearing a tattered loose black sweater 
     is something wrong   he asked 
     no  why would it be  
     youre sweating  
    i wiped my forehead with my hand  it was true i was dripping
with sweat  it must have been a reaction to the shock id just had 
he scrutinized me  should i tell him  id rather hed have shown
more trust in me  who was playing against whom  and in what
incomprehensible way 
     its hot here   i said   i thought your air conditioning would be
working better  
     itll catch up in an hour or so  are you sure its only from the
heat   he looked up at me  i chewed my food steadily as if i hadnt
noticed 
     what do you mean to do   he asked finally  after we were done
eating  he dropped the full dishes and the empty cans in the sink by
the wall and came back to his chair 
     ill fit in with your plans   i replied impassively   you have a
research program  right  some new kind of stimulus  apparently x 
rays or something like that  
     x rays   he raised his eyebrows   where did you hear that  
     i dont remember  someone told me  on the prometheus maybe 
why  is it already under way  
     i dont know the details  it was gibarians idea  he started it with
sartorius  but how could you know about it  
    i shrugged 
     you dont know the details  you should have been part of it  i
mean  its partly your area       i trailed off  he said nothing  the
whine from the air conditioning quieted down  but the temperature
remained at a tolerable level  there was merely a permanent high
tone hanging in the air  like the buzz of a dying fly  snaut stood  went
up to the console and began flipping switches senselessly  since the
main lever was in the off position  he fooled around like this for a
while then  still with his back to me  he remarked 
     itll be necessary to complete the formalities regarding the     
you know  
     is that so  
    he turned and looked at me as if close to rage  i cant say i was
deliberately trying to needle him  but not understanding any part of
the game that was being played here i preferred to be guarded  his
bony adams apple moved up and down beneath the black turtleneck
of his sweater 
     you were in gibarians room   he said abruptly 
    i jerked my head as if to say   lets say i was  
    i wanted him to go on 
     who was there  
    he knew about her 
     no one  who could have been there   i asked 
     so why wouldnt you let me in  
    i smiled 
     i got scared  after your warning  when the handle moved i
grabbed it instinctively  why didnt you say it was you  id have let
you in  
     i thought it was sartorius   he said unsurely 
     what of it  
     what do you think about      what happened there   he said 
answering a question with a question 
    i hesitated 
     you must know better than me  where is he  
     in the cold room   he replied immediately   we moved him there
right away in the morning      because of the heat  
     where did you find him  
     in a locker  
     in a locker  he was dead already  
     his heart was still beating  but he wasnt breathing  he was in
his death throes  
     did you try to save him  
     no  
     why not  
    he paused 
     i was too late  he died before i could lie him down  
     he was standing in the closet  in amongst those overalls  
     yes  
    he went up to a small desk in the corner and fetched a sheet of
paper that had been lying on it  he placed it in front of me 
     i wrote a kind of interim report   he said   its actually good that
you took a look at the room  cause of death      injection of a lethal
dose of pernostal  its written here      
    i scanned the brief text 
     suicide   i repeated quietly   and the reason  
      nervous breakdown      depression      or whatever it ought to
be called  you know these things better than i do  
      i only know what i can see myself   i replied and looked up into
his eyes  for he was standing over me 
      what do you mean by that   he asked calmly 
      he injected himself with pernostal and hid in a closet  yes  if
that was the case  it wasnt depression or nervous breakdown  it was
severe psychosis  paranoia      he probably thought he was seeing
something         i said  speaking ever more slowly and looking him
in the eye 
     he walked off to the radio console and started flicking switches
again 
      your signature is here   i said after a moments silence   what
about sartorius  
      hes in the lab  i already told you  he doesnt come out  im
assuming that      
      that what  
      that hes locked himself in  
      locked himself in  i see  locked himself in  how about that 
perhaps hes barricaded the door  
      perhaps  
      snaut         i said   theres someone on the station  
      youve seen   
     he looked across at me as he leaned over 
      you warned me  about who  was it a hallucination  
      what did you see  
      its a human  yes  
     he said nothing  he turned towards the wall  as if he didnt want
me to see his face  he drummed his fingers on a metal partition  i
looked at his hands  there was no trace of blood on his knuckles  i
had a flash of insight 
      that person is real   i said softly  almost in a whisper  as if i were
telling him a secret that could be overheard   right  she can be     
touched  she can be      hurt      the last time you saw her was
today  
      how do you know  
     he didnt turn around  he stood right by the wall  his chest leaning
against it as my words struck him 
      right before i landed      not long before  
     he flinched as if from a blow  i saw the wild look in his eyes 
      you    he stammered out   who are you  
     he looked as if he was about to pounce on me  that i was not
expecting  the situation was upside down  so he didnt believe i was
who i said i was  what was this supposed to mean   he was staring
at me in absolute terror  was he mad already  poisoned  anything
was becoming possible  but id seen her this creature  so then i
myself      also       
      who was it   i asked  my words calmed him  for a moment
he eyed me as if he still didnt believe me  before he even opened
his mouth i knew it had been a false move on my part and that he
wouldnt answer me 
     he eased himself into anarm chair and put his head in his hands 
      the things happening here         he said in a low voice   a
malignant fever      
      who was it   i asked once again 
      if you dont know         he murmured 
      then what  
      then nothing  
      snaut   i said   were far enough away from home  lets play with
open cards  everythings complicated enough as it is  
      what do you mean  
      that you should tell me who i saw  
      and you         he retorted suspiciously 
      youre losing it  ill tell you and you tell me  you can rest assured
i wont think youre crazy  because i know      
      crazy  good god   he tried to laugh   you dont  you have no   
  that would be a perfect solution  if he had believed for a moment it
was madness  he wouldnt have done it  hed still be alive      
      so what you said in the report about a nervous breakdown was
a lie  
      of course  
      why wont you write the truth  
      why         he repeated 
     there was a pause  once again i was completely in the dark  i
didnt get a thing  though for a moment it seemed id managed to
convince him to approach the mystery by combining forces  why 
why wouldnt he say  
      where are the automats   i put in 
      in the depositories  we locked them all away except for the
docking bay service  
      why  
     again he didnt answer 
      you wont say  
      i cant  
     there was something in all this that i couldnt put my finger on 
maybe i should go upstairs and see sartorius  i suddenly remembered
the note  and at the present moment that seemed the most important
thing 
      can you imagine going on working in these conditions   i asked 
     he gave a contemptuous shrug 
      what difference does it make  
      is that so  then what do you intend to do  
     he said nothing  in the silence the distant sound of bare footsteps
could be heard  amid the plastic and nickel plated implements  the
tall lockers with electronic equipment  glassware  and precision instru 
ments  that ambling  lazy tread sounded like a stupid trick performed
by someone with a screw loose  the sound was coming closer  i
stood up  intently watching snaut  he was listening closely  his eyes
narrowed to slits  but he didnt seem at all alarmed  so it wasnt her
he was afraid of 
      where did she come from   i asked  then  when he hesitated to
answer   do you not want to say  
      i dont know  
      all right  
     the footsteps receded and faded away 
      you dont believe me   he said   i give you my word i dont
know  
    i was silent  i opened a locker containing space suits and pushed
aside their heavy empty shells  as i suspected  at the back  hanging
on hooks there were gas pistols used to move about in a gravitational
vacuum  they werent much use  but at least they were some kind of
weapon  i preferred that to nothing  i checked the cartridge case and
hung the strap of the holster over my arm  snaut was observing me
watchfully  as i adjusted the strap he bared his yellowed teeth in a
mocking smile 
     happy hunting   he said 
     thanks for everything   i retorted  heading for the door  he
jumped up from his armchair 
     kelvin  
    i looked at him  he was no longer smiling  i dont know that ive
ever seen such a tired looking face 
     kelvin  its not      i      i really cant   he stammered  i waited
to see if hed say any more  but he just moved his lips as if he was
trying to spit something out 
    i turned and left without a word
