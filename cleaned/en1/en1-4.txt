 i followed a long  empty corridor  then forked right  i had never lived on the station  but during my training on earth i had spent six weeks in an exact replica of it  when i reached a short aluminum stairway  i knew where it led 
     the library was in darkness  and i had to fumble for the light switch  i first consulted the index  then dialled the coordinates for the first volume of the solarist annual and its supplement  a red light came on  i turned to the register  the two books were marked out to    together with  the little apocrypha   i switched the lights off and returned to the lower deck 
     in spite of having heard the footsteps receding  i was afraid to re enter  s room   she  might return  i hesitated for some time outside the door  finally  pressing down the handle  i forced myself to go in 
     there was no one in the room  i began rummaging through the books scattered beneath the window  interrupting my search only to close the locker door  i could not bear the sight of the empty space among the work suits 
     the supplement was not in the first pile  so  one by one  i started methodically picking up the rest of the books around the room  when i reached the final pile  between the bed and the wardrobe  i found the volume i was looking for 
     i was hoping to find some sort of clue and  sure enough  a book marker had been slipped between the pages of the index  a name  unfamiliar to me  had been underlined in red  andre berton  the corresponding page numbers indicated two different chapters  glancing at the first  i learnt that berton was a reserve pilot on shannahans ship  the second reference appeared about a hundred pages further on 
     at first  it seemed  shannahans expedition had proceeded with extreme caution  when  however  after sixteen days  the plasmatic ocean had not only shown no signs of aggression  but appeared to shun any direct contact with men and machines  recoiling whenever anything approached its surface  shannahan and his deputy  timolis  discontinued some of the precautions which were hindering the progress of their work  the force fences which had been used to demarcate and protect the working areas were taken back to base  and the expedition split up into groups of two or three men  some groups making reconnaissance flights over a radius of some several hundred miles 
     apart from some unexpected damage to the oxygen supply systems   the atmosphere had an unusually corrosive effect on the valves  which had to be replaced almost daily   four days passed without mishap  on the morning of the fifth day   21 days after the arrival of the expedition   two scientists  carucci and fechner  the first a radiobiologist  the second a physicist   left on a mission aboard a hovercraft  six hours later  the explorers were overdue  timolis  who was in charge of the base in shannahans absence  raised the alarm and diverted every available man into search parties 
     by a fatal combination of circumstances  long range radio contact had been cut that morning an hour after the departure of the exploration groups   a large spot had appeared on the red sun  producing a heavy bombardment of charged particles in the upper atmosphere  only the ultra shortwave transmitters continued to function  and contact was restricted to a radius of about twenty miles  as a crowning stroke of bad luck  a thick fog descended just before sunset and the search had to be called off 
     the rescue teams were returning to base when the hovercraft was spotted by a flitter  barely 24 miles from the command ship  the engine was running and the machine  at first sight undamaged  was hovering above the waves  carucci alone could be seen  semi conscious  in the glass domed cockpit 
     the hovercraft was escorted back to base  after treatment  carucci quickly regained consciousness  but could throw no light on fechners disappearance  just after they had decided to return to base a valve in his oxygen gear had failed and a small amount of unfiltered gas had penetrated his atmosphere suit  in an attempt to repair the valve  fechner had been forced to undo his safety belt and stand up  that was the last thing carucci could remember 
     according to the experts who reconstructed the sequence of events  fechner must have opened the cabin roof because it impeded his movements   a perfectly legitimate thing to do since the cabins of these vehicles were not air tight  the glass dome merely providing some protection against infiltration and turbulence  while fechner was occupied with his colleague  his own oxygen supply had probably been damaged and  no longer realizing what he was doing  he had pulled himself up on to the superstructure  from which he had fallen into the ocean 
     fechner thus became the oceans first victim  although the atmosphere suit was buoyant  they searched for his body without success  it was  of course  possible that it was still floating somewhere on the surface  but the expedition was not equipped for a thorough search of this immense  undulating desert  covered with patches of dense fog 
     by dusk  all but one of the search craft had returned to base  only a big supply helicopter piloted by andre berton was still missing  just as they were about to raise the alarm  the aircraft appeared  berton was obviously suffering from nervous shock  after struggling out of his suit  he ran round in circles like a madman  he had to be overpowered  but went on shouting and sobbing  it was rather surprising behavior to put it mildly  on the part of a man who had been flying for seventeen years and was well used to the hazards of cosmic navigation  the doctors assumed that he too was suffering from the effects of unfiltered gases 
     having more or less recovered his senses  berton nevertheless refused to leave the base  or even to go near the window overlooking the ocean  two days later  he asked for permission to dictate a flight report  stressing the importance of what he was about to reveal  this report was studied by the expeditionary council  who concluded that it was the morbid creation of a mind under the influence of poisonous gases from the atmosphere  as for the supposed revelations  they were evidently regarded as part of bertons clinical history rather than that of the expedition itself  and they were not described 
     so much for the supplement  it seemed to me that bertons report must at any rate provide a key to the mystery  what strange happening could have had such a shattering effect on a veteran space pilot  i began to search through the books once more  but
  the little apocrypha  was not to be found  i was growing more and more exhausted and left the room  having decided to postpone the search until the following day 
     as i was passing the foot of the stairway  i noticed that the aluminum treads were streaked with light falling from above    was still at work  i decided to go up and see him 
     it was hotter on the upper deck  but the paper strips still fluttered frenziedly at the airvents  the corridor was wide and low ceilinged  the main laboratory was enclosed by a thick panel of opaque glass in a chrome embrasure  a dark curtain screened the door on the inside  and the light was coming from windows let in above the lintel  i pressed down the handle  but  as i expected  the door refused to budge  the only sound from the laboratory was an intermittent whine like that of a defective gas jet  i knocked  no reply  i called 
         dr     im the new man     i must see you  its very important  please let me in  
     there was a rustling of papers 
      its me     you must have heard of me  i arrived off the  prometheus  a few hours ago  
     i was shouting  my lips glued to the angle where the door joined the metal frame 
      dr     im alone  please open the door  
     not a word  then the same rustling as before  followed by the clink of metal instruments on a tray  then       i could scarcely believe my ears       there came a succession of little short footsteps  like the rapid drumming of a pair of tiny feet  or remarkably agile fingers tapping out the rhythm of steps on the lid of an empty tin box 
     i yelled 
      dr     are you going to open this door  yes or no  
     no answer  nothing but the pattering  and  simultaneously  the sound of a man walking on tiptoe  but  if the man was moving about  he could not at the same time be tapping out an imitation of a childs footsteps 
     no longer able to control my growing fury  i burst out 
      dr     i have not made a sixteen month journey just to come here and play games  ill count up to ten  if you dont let me in  i shall break down the door  
     in fact  i was doubtful whether it would be easy to force this particular door  and the discharge of a gas pistol is not very powerful  nevertheless  i was determined somehow or other to carry out my threat  even if it meant resorting to explosives  which i could probably find in the munition store  i could not draw back now  i could not go on playing an insane game with all the cards stacked against me 
     there was the sound of a struggle   or was it simply objects being thrust aside  the curtain was pulled back  and an elongated shadow was projected on to the glass 
     a hoarse  high pitched voice spoke 
      if i open the door  you must give me your word not to come in  
      in that case  why open it  
      ill come out  
      very well  i promise  
     the silhouette vanished and the curtain was carefully replaced 
     obscure noises came from inside the laboratory  i heard a scraping   a table being dragged across the floor  at last  the lock clicked back  and the glass panel opened just enough to allow   to slip through into the corridor 
     he stood with his back against the door  very tall and thin  all bones under his white sweater  he had a black scarf knotted around his neck  and over his arm he was carrying a laboratory smock  covered with chemical burns  his head  which was unusually narrow  was cocked to one side  i could not see his eyes  he wore curved dark glasses  which covered up half his face  his lower jaw was elongated  he had bluish lips and enormous  blue tinged ears  he was unshaven  red anti radiation gloves hung by their laces from his wrists 
     for a moment we looked at one another with undisguised aversion  his shaggy hair  he had obviously cut it himself  was the color of lead  his beard grizzled  like snow  his forehead was burnt  but the lower half only  above it was pallid  he must have worn some kind of cap when exposed to the sun 
      well  im listening   he said 
     i had the impression that he did not care what i had to say to him  standing there  tense  still pressed against the door panel  his attention was mainly directed to what was going on behind him 
     disconcerted  i hardly knew how to begin 
      my name is     i said   you must have heard about me  i am  or rather i was  a colleague of  s  
     his thin face  entirely composed of vertical planes  exactly as i had always imagined 
don quixotes  was quite expressionless  this blank mask did not help me to find the right words 
      i heard that   was dead        i broke off 
      yes  go on  im listening   his voice betrayed his impatience 
      did he commit suicide  who found the body  you or snow  
      why ask me  didnt dr  snow tell you what happened  
      i wanted to hear your own account  
      youve studied psychology  havent you  dr     
      yes  what of it  
      you think of yourself as a servant of science  
      yes  of course  what has that to do with       
      you are not an officer of the law  at this hour of the day  you should be at work  but instead of doing the job you were sent here for  you not only threaten to force the door of my laboratory  you question me as though i were a criminal suspect  
     his forehead was dripping with sweat  i controlled myself with an effort  i was determined to get through to him  i gritted my teeth and said 
      you  are  suspect  dr     what is more  youre well aware of it  
         unless you either retract or apologize  i shall lodge a complaint against you  
      why should i apologize  youre the one who barricaded himself in this laboratory instead of coming out to meet me  instead of telling me the truth about what is going on here  have you gone completely mad  what are you   a scientist  or a miserable coward  
     i dont know what other insults i hurled at him  he did not even flinch  globules of sweat trickled down over the enlarged pores of his cheeks  suddenly i realized that he had not heard a word i was saying  both hands behind his back  he was holding the door in position with all his strength  it was rattling as though someone inside were firing bursts from a machine gun at the panel 
     in a strange  high pitched voice  he moaned 
      go away  for gods sake  leave me  go downstairs  ill join you later  ill do whatever you want  only please go away now  
     his voice betrayed such exhaustion that instinctively i put out my arms to help him control the door  at this  he uttered a cry of horror  as though i had pointed a knife at him  as i retreated  he was shouting in his falsetto voice   go away  go away  im coming  im coming  im coming  no  no   he opened the door and shot inside  i thought i saw a shining yellow disc flash across his chest 
     now a muffled clamor rose from the laboratory  a huge shadow appeared  as the curtain was brushed momentarily aside  then it fell back into place and i could see nothing more  what was happening inside that room  i heard running footsteps  as though a mad chase were in progress  followed by a terrifying crash of broken glass and the sound of a childs laugh 
     my legs were trembling  and i stared at the door  appalled  the din had subsided  giving way to an uneasy silence  i sat down on a window ledge  too stunned to move  my head was splitting 
     from where i was  i could see only a part of the corridor encircling the laboratory  i was at the summit of the station  beneath the actual shell of the superstructure  the walls were concave and sloping  with oblong windows a few yards apart  the blue day was ending  and  as the shutters grated upwards  a blinding light shone through the thick glass  every metal fitting  every latch and joint  blazed  and the great glass panel of the laboratory door glittered with pale coruscations  my hands looked grey in the spectral light  i noticed that i was holding the gas pistol  i had not realized that i had taken it out of its holster  and replaced it  what use could i have made of it   or even of a gamma pistol  had i had one  i could hardly have taken the laboratory by force 
     i got up  the disc of the sun  reminiscent of a hydrogen explosion  was sinking into the ocean  and as i descended the stairway i was pierced by a jet of horizontal rays which was almost tangible  halfway downstairs i paused to think  then went back up the steps and followed the corridor round the laboratory  soon  i came across a second glass door  exactly like the first  i made no attempt to open it  knowing that it would be locked 
     i was looking for an opening or vent of some sort  the idea of spying on   had come to me quite naturally  without the least sense of shame  i was determined to have done with conjecture and discover the truth  even if  as i imagined it would  the truth proved incomprehensible  it struck me that the laboratory must be lit from above by windows let into the dome  it should be possible  therefore  to spy on   from the outside  but first i should have to equip myself with an atmosphere suit and oxygen gear 
     when i reached the deck below  i found the door of the radio cabin ajar  snow  sunk in his armchair  was asleep  at the sound of my footsteps  he opened his eyes with a start 
      hello      he croaked   well  did you discover anything  
      yes       hes not alone   snow grinned sourly 
      oh  really  well  thats something  has he got visitors  
      i cant understand why you wont tell me whats going on   i retorted impulsively   since i have to remain here  im bound to find out the truth sooner or later  why the mystery  
      when youve received some visitors yourself  youll understand  
     i had the impression that my presence annoyed him and he had no desire to prolong the conversation  i turned to go   where are you off to   i did not answer 
     the hangar deck was just as i had left it  my burnt out capsule still stood there  gaping open  on its platform  on my way to select an atmosphere suit  i suddenly realized that the skylights through which i hoped to observe   would probably be made of slabs of opaque glass  and i lost interest in my venture on to the outer hull 
     instead  i descended the spiral stairway which led to the lower deck store rooms  the cramped passage at the bottom contained the usual litter of crates and cylinders 
     the walls were sheeted in bare metal which had a bluish glint  a little further on  the frosted pipes of the refrigeration plant appeared beneath a vault and i followed them to the far end of the corridor where they vanished into a cooling jacket with a wide  plastic collar  the door to the cold store was two inches thick and lagged with an insulating compound  when i opened it  the icy cold gripped me  i stood  shivering  on the threshold of a cave carved out of an iceberg  the huge coils  like sculptured reliefs  were hung with stalactites  here  too  buried beneath a covering of snow  there were crates and cylinders  and shelves laden with boxes and transparent bags containing a yellow  oily substance  the vault sloped downwards to where a curtain of ice hid the back of the cave  i broke through it  an elongated figure  covered with a sheet of canvas  lay stretched out on an aluminum rack 
     i lifted a corner of the canvas and recognised the stiff features of    his glossy black hair clung tightly to his skull  the sinews of his throat stood out like bones  his glazed eyes stared up at the vault  a tear of opaque ice hanging from the corner of each lid  the cold was so intense that i had to clench my teeth to prevent them from chattering  i touched  s cheek  it was like touching a block of petrified wood  bristling with black prickly hairs  the curve of the lips seemed to express an infinite  disdainful patience 
     as i let the canvas fall  i noticed  peeping out from beneath the folds at the foot  five round  shiny objects  like black pearls  ranged in order of size  i stiffened with horror 
     what i had seen were the round pads of five bare toes  under the shroud  flattened against  s body  lay the negress  slowly  i pulled back the canvas  her head  covered in frizzy hair twisted up into little tufts  was resting in the hollow of one massive arm  her back glistened  the skin stretched taut over the spinal column  the huge body gave no sign of life  i looked again at the soles of her naked feet  they had not been flattened or deformed in any way by the weight which they had had to carry  walking had not calloused the skin  which was as unblemished as that of her shoulders 
     with a far greater effort than it had taken to touch  s corpse  i forced myself to touch one of the bare feet  then i made a second bewildering discovery  this body  abandoned in a deep freeze  this apparent corpse  lived and moved  the woman had withdrawn her foot  like a sleeping dog when you try to take its paw 
      shell freeze   i thought confusedly  but her flesh had been warm to the touch  and i even imagined i had felt the regular beating of her pulse  i backed out and fled 
     as i emerged from the white cave  the heat seemed suffocating  i climbed the spiral stairway back to the hangar deck 
     i sat on the hoops of a rolled up parachute and put my head in my hands  i was stunned  my thoughts ran wild  what was happening to me  if my reason was giving way  the sooner i lost consciousness the better  the idea of sudden extinction aroused an inexpressible  unrealistic hope 
     useless to go and find snow or    no one could fully understand what i had just experienced  what i had seen  what i had touched with my own hands  there was only one possible explanation  one possible conclusion  madness  yes  that was it  i had gone mad as soon as i arrived here  emanations from the ocean had attacked my brain  and hallucination had followed hallucination  rather than exhaust myself trying to solve these illusory riddles  i would do better to ask for medical assistance  to radio the  prometheus  or some other vessel  to send out an sos 
     then a curious change came over me  at the thought that i had gone mad  i calmed down 
     and yet       i had heard snows words quite clearly  if  that is  snow existed and i had ever spoken to him  the hallucinations might have begun much earlier  perhaps i was still on board the  prometheus   perhaps i had been stricken with a sudden mental illness and was now confronting the creations of my own inflamed brain 
     assuming that i was ill  there was reason to believe that i would get better  which gave me some hope of deliverance   a hope irreconcilable with a belief in the reality of the tangled nightmares through which i had just lived 
     if only i could think up some experiment in logic   a key experiment   which would reveal whether i had really gone mad and was a helpless prey to the figments of my imagination  or whether  in spite of their ludicrous improbability  i had been experiencing real events 
     as i turned all this over in my mind  i was looking at the monorail which led to the launching pad  it was a steel girder  painted pale green  a yard above the ground  here and there  the paint was chipped  worn by the friction of the rocket trolleys  i touched the steel  feeling it grow warm beneath my fingers  and rapped the metal plating with my knuckles  could madness attain such a degree of reality  yes  i answered myself  after all  it was my own subject  i knew what i was talking about 
     but was it possible to work out a controlled experiment  at first i told myself that it was not  since my sick brain  if it really was sick  would create the illusions i demanded of it  even while dreaming  when we are in perfectly good health  we talk to strangers  put questions to them and hear their replies  moreover  although our interlocutors are in fact the creations of our own psychic activity  evolved by a pseudo independent process  until they have spoken to us we do not know what words will emerge from their lips  and yet these words have been formulated by a separate part of our own minds  we should therefore be aware of them at the very moment that we think them up in order to put them into the mouths of imaginary beings  consequently  whatever form my proposed test were to take  and whatever method i used to put it into execution  there was always the possibility that i was behaving exactly as in a dream  neither snow nor   having any real existence  it would be pointless to put questions to them 
     i thought of taking some powerful drug  peyotl for example  or another preparation inducing vivid hallucinations  if visions ensued  this would prove that i had really experienced these recent events and that they were part and parcel of the surrounding material reality  but then  no  i thought  this would not constitute the proof i needed  since i knew the effects of the drug  which i should have chosen for myself  and my imagination could suggest to me the double illusion of having taken the drug and of experiencing its effects 
     i was going around in circles  there seemed to be no escape  it was not possible to think except with ones brain  no one could stand outside himself in order to check the functioning of his inner processes  suddenly an idea struck me  as simple as it was effective 
     i leapt to my feet and ran to the radio cabin  the room was deserted  i glanced at the electric clock on the wall  nearly four oclock  the fourth hour of the stations artificial night time  outside  the red sun was shining  i quickly plugged in the long range transmitter  and while the valves warmed up  i went over in my mind the principal stages of the experiment 
     i could not remember the call sign for the automatic station on the satellite  but i found it on a card hanging above the main instrument panel  sent it out in morse  and received the answering signal eight seconds later  the satellite  or rather its electronic brain  identified itself by a rhythmic pulse 
     i instructed the satellite to give me the figures of the galactic meridians it was traversing at 22 second intervals while orbiting solaris  and i specified an answer to five decimal points 
     then i sat and waited for the reply  ten minutes later  it arrived  i tore off the strip of freshly printed paper and hid it in a drawer  taking care not to look at it  i went to the bookcase and took out the big galactic charts  the logarithm tables  a calendar giving the daily path of the satellite  and various other textbooks  then i sat down to work out for myself the answer to the question i had posed 
     for an hour or more  i integrated the equations  it was a long time since i had tackled such elaborate calculations  my last major effort in this direction must have been my practical astronomy exam 
     i worked at the problem with the help of the stations giant computer  my reasoning went as follows  by making my calculations from the galactic charts  i would obtain an approximate cross check with the results provided by the satellite  approximate because the path of the satellite was subject to very complex variations due to the effects of the gravitational forces of solaris and its two suns  as well as to the local variations in gravity caused by the ocean  when i had the two series of figures  one furnished by the satellite and the other calculated theoretically on the basis of the galactic charts  i would make the necessary adjustments and the two groups would then coincide up to the fourth decimal point  discrepancies due to the unforeseeable influence of the ocean arising only at the fifth 
     if the figures obtained from the satellite were simply the product of my deranged mind  they could not possibly coincide with the second series  my brain might be unhinged  but it could not conceivably compete with the stations giant computer and secretly perform calculations requiring several months work  therefore if the figures corresponded  it would follow that the stations computer really existed  that i had really used it  and that i was not delirious 
     my hands trembled as i took the telegraphic tape out of the drawer and laid it alongside the wide band of paper from the computer  as i had predicted  the two series of numbers corresponded up to the fourth decimal point 
     i put all the papers away in the drawer  so the computer existed independently of me  that meant that the station and its inhabitants really existed too 
     as i was closing the drawer  i noticed that it was stuffed with sheets of paper covered with hastily scribbled sums  a single glance told me that someone had already attempted an experiment similar to mine and had asked the satellite  not for information about the galactic meridians  but for the measurements of solariss albedo at intervals of forty seconds 
     i was not mad  the last ray of hope was extinguished  i unplugged the transmitter  drank the remains of the soup in the vacuum flask  and went to bed
