Desperation and a sort of dumb rage had sustained me while working with the computer  Now  overcome with exhaustion  I could not even remember how to let down a mechanical bed  Forgetting to push back the clamps  I hung on to the handle with all my weight and the mattress tumbled down on top of me 
     I tore off my clothes and flung them away from me  then collapsed on to the pillow  without even taking the trouble to inflate it properly  I fell asleep with the lights on 
     I reopened my eyes with the impression of having dozed off for only a few minutes  The room was bathed in a dim red light  It was cooler  and I felt refreshed 
     I lay there  the bedclothes pushed back  completely naked  The curtains were half drawn  and there  opposite me  beside the window pane lit by the red sun  someone was sitting  It was Rheya  She was wearing a white beach dress  the material stretched tightly over her breasts  She sat with her legs crossed  her feet were bare  Motionless  leaning on her sun tanned arms  she gazed at me from beneath her black lashes  Rheya  with her dark hair brushed back  For a long time  I lay there peacefully gazing back at her  My first thought was reassuring  I was dreaming and I was aware that I was 
dreaming  Nevertheless  I would have preferred her not to be there  I closed my eyes and tried to shake off the dream  When I opened them again  Rheya was still sitting opposite me 
     Her lips were pouting slightly   a habit of hers   as though she were about to whistle  but her expression was serious  I thought of my recent speculations on the subject of dreams 
     She had not changed since the day I had seen her for the last time  she was then a girl of nineteen  Today  she would be twenty nine  But  evidently  the dead do not change  they remain eternally young  She went on gazing at me  an expression of surprise on her face  I thought of throwing something at her  but  even in a dream  I could not bring myself to harm a dead person 
     I murmured   Poor little thing  have you come to visit me  
     The sound of my voice frightened me  the room  Rheya  everything seemed extraordinarily real  A three dimensional dream  colored in half tones         I saw several objects on the floor which I had not noticed when I went to bed  When I wake up  I told myself  I shall check whether these things are still there or whether  like Rheya  I only saw them in a dream 
      Do you mean to stay for long   I asked  I realized that I was speaking very softly  like someone afraid of being overheard  Why worry about eavesdroppers in a dream 
     The sun was rising over the horizon  A good sign  I had gone to bed during a red day  which should have been succeeded by a blue day  followed by another red day  I had not slept for fifteen hours at a stretch  So it was a dream 
     Reassured  I looked closely at Rheya  She was silhouetted against the sun  The scarlet rays cast a glow over the smooth skin of her left cheek and the shadows of her eyelashes fell across her face  How pretty she was  Even in my sleep my memory of her was uncannily precise  I watched the movements of the sun  waiting to see the dimple appear in that unusual place slightly below the corner of the lips  All the same  I would have preferred to wake up  It was time I did some work  I closed my eyelids tightly 
     I heard a metallic noise  and opened my eyes again  Rheya was sitting beside me on the bed  still looking at me gravely  I smiled at her  She smiled back at me and leant forward  We kissed  First a timid  childish kiss  then more prolonged ones  I held her for a long time  Was it possible to feel so much in a dream  I wondered  I was not betraying her memory  for it was of her that I was dreaming  only her  It had never happened to me before        
     Was it then that I began to have doubts  I went on telling myself that it was a dream  but my heart tightened 
     I tensed my muscles  ready to leap out of bed  I was half expecting to fail  for often  in dreams  your sluggish body refuses to respond  I hoped that the effort would drag me out of sleep  But I did not wake  I sat on the edge of the bed  my legs dangling  There was nothing for it  I should have to endure this dream right to the bitter end  My feeling of well being had vanished  I was afraid 
      What        I asked  I cleared my throat   What do you want  
     I felt around the floor with my bare feet  searching for a pair of slippers  I stubbed my toe against a sharp edge  and stifled a cry of pain  Thatll wake me up  I thought with satisfaction  at the same time remembering that I had no slippers 
     But still it went on  Rheya had drawn back and was leaning against the end of the bed  Her dress rose and fell lightly with her breathing  She watched me with quiet interest 
     Quick  I thought  a shower  But then I realized that in a dream a shower would not interrupt my sleep 
      Where have you come from  
     She seized my hand and  with a gesture I knew well  threw it up and caught it again  then played with my fingers 
      I dont know   she replied   Are you angry  
     It was her voice  that familiar  low pitched  slightly faraway voice  and that air of not caring much about what she was saying  of already being preoccupied with something else  People used to think her off hand  even rude  because the expression on her face rarely changed from one of vague astonishment 
      Did       did anyone see you  
      I dont know  I got here without any trouble  Why  Kris  is it important  
     She was still playing with my fingers  but her face now wore a slight frown 
      Rheya  
      What  my darling  
      How did you know where I was  
     She pondered  A broad smile revealed her teeth 
      I havent the faintest idea  Isnt it funny  When I came in you were asleep  I didnt wake you up because you get cross so easily  You have a very bad temper  
     She squeezed my hand 
      Did you go down below  
      Yes  It was all frozen  I ran away  
     She let go of my hand and lay back  With her hair falling to one side  she looked at me with the half smile that had irritated me before it had captivated me 
      But  Rheya        I stammered 
     I leaned over her and turned back the short sleeve of her dress  There  just above her vaccination scar  was a red dot  the mark of a hypodermic needle  I was not really surprised  but my heart gave a lurch 
     I touched the red spot with my finger  For years now I had dreamt of it  over and over again  always waking with a shudder to find myself in the same position  doubled up between the crumpled sheets   just as I had found her  already growing cold  It was as though  in my sleep  I tried to relive what she had gone through  as though I hoped to turn back the clock and ask her forgiveness  or keep her company during those final minutes when she was feeling the effects of the injection and was overcome by terror  She  who dreaded the least scratch  who hated pain or the sight of blood  had deliberately done this horrible thing  leaving nothing but a few scribbled words addressed to me  I had kept her note in my wallet  By now it was soiled and creased  but I had never had the heart to throw it away 
     Time and time again I had imagined her tracing those words and making her final preparations  I persuaded myself that she had only been play acting  that she had wanted to frighten me and had taken an overdose by mistake  Everyone told me that it must have happened like that  or else it had been a spontaneous decision  the result of a sudden depression  But people knew nothing of what I had said to her five days earlier  they did not know that  in order to twist the knife more cruelly  I had taken away my belongings and that she  as I was closing my suitcases  had said  very calmly   I suppose you know what this means   And I had pretended not to understand  even though I knew quite well what she meant  I thought her too much of a coward  and had even told her as much         And now she was lying across the bed  looking at me attentively  as though she did not know that it was I who had killed her 
      Well   she asked  Her eyes reflected the red sun  The entire room was red  Rheya looked at her arm with interest  because I had been examining it for so long  and when I drew back she laid her smooth  cool cheek in the palm of my hand 
      Rheya   I stammered   its not possible       
      Hush  
     I could sense the movement of her eyes beneath their closed lids 
      Where are we  Rheya  
      At home  
      Wheres that  
     One eye opened and shut again instantly  The long lashes tickled my palm 
      Kris  
      What  
      Im happy  
     Raising my head  I could see part of the bed in the washbasin mirror  a cascade of soft hair   Rheyas hair   and my bare knees  I pulled towards me with my foot one of the misshapen objects I had found in the box and picked it up with my free hand  It was a spindle  one end of which had melted to a needle point  I held the point to my skin and dug it in  just beside a small pink scar  The pain shot through my whole body  I watched the blood run down the inside of my thigh and drip noiselessly on to the floor 
     What was the use  Terrifying thoughts assailed me  thoughts which were taking a definite shape  I no longer told myself   Its a dream   I had ceased to believe that  Now I was thinking   I must be ready to defend myself  
     I examined her shoulders  her hip under the close fitting white dress  and her dangling naked feet  Leaning forward  I took hold of one of her ankles and ran my fingers over the sole of her foot 
     The skin was soft  like that of a newborn child 
     I knew then that it was not Rheya  and I was almost certain that she herself did not know it 
     The bare foot wriggled and Rheyas lips parted in silent laughter 
      Stop it   she murmured 
     Cautiously I withdrew my hand from under the cheek and stood up  Then I dressed quickly  She sat up and watched me 
      Where are your things   I asked her  Immediately  I regretted my question 
      My things  
      Dont you have anything except that dress  
     From now on  I would pursue the game with my eyes open  I tried to appear unconcerned  indifferent  as though we had parted only yesterday  as though we had never parted 
     She stood up  With a familiar gesture  she tugged at her skirt to smooth out the creases  My words had worried her  but she said nothing  For the first time  she examined the room with an enquiring  scrutinizing gaze  Then  puzzled  she replied        I dont know   She opened the locker door   In here  perhaps  
      No  theres nothing but work suits in there  
     I found an electric point by the basin and began to shave  careful not to take my eyes off her 
     She went to and fro  rummaging everywhere  Eventually  she came up to me and said 
      Kris  I have the feeling that somethings happened        
     She broke off  I unplugged the razor  and waited   I have the feeling that Ive forgotten something   she went on   that Ive forgotten a lot of things  I can only remember you  I       I cant remember anything else        I listened to her  forcing myself to look unconcerned 
      Have I       Have I been ill   she asked 
      Yes       in a way  Yes  youve been slightly ill  
      There you are then  That explains my lapses of memory  
     She had brightened up again  Never shall I be able to describe how I felt then  As I watched her moving about the room  now smiling  now serious  talkative one moment  silent the next  sitting down and then getting up again  my terror was gradually overcome by the conviction that it was the real Rheya there in the room with me  even though my reason told me that she seemed somehow stylized  reduced to certain characteristic expressions  gestures and movements 
     Suddenly  she clung to me 
      Whats happening to us  Kris   She pressed her fists against my chest   Is everything all right  Is there something wrong  
      Things couldnt be better  
She smiled wanly 
 When you answer me like that  it means things could hardly be worse  
    What nonsense   I said hurriedly   Rheya  my darling  I must leave you  Wait here for me   And  because I was becoming extremely hungry  I added   Would you like something to eat  
      To eat   She shook her head   No  Will I have to wait long for you  
      Only an hour  
      Im coming with you  
      You cant come with me  Ive got work to do  
      Im coming with you  
     She had changed  This was not Rheya at all  the real Rheya never imposed herself  would never have forced her presence on me 
      Its impossible  my sweet  
     She looked me up and down  Then suddenly she seized my hand  And my hand lingered  moved up her warm  rounded arm  In spite of myself I was caressing her  My body recognized her body  my body desired her  my body was attracted towards hers beyond reason  beyond thought  beyond fear 
     Desperately trying to remain calm  I repeated        Rheya  its out of the question  You must stay here  
     A single word echoed round the room 
      No  
      Why  
      I       I dont know   She looked around her  then  once more  raised her eyes to mine   I cant   she whispered 
      But why  
      I dont know  I cant  Its as though       as though       
     She searched for the answer which  as she uttered it  seemed to come to her like a revelation   Its as though I mustnt let you out of my sight  
     The resolute tone of her voice scarcely suggested an avowal of affection  it implied something quite different  With this realization  the manner in which I was embracing Rheya underwent an abrupt  though not immediately noticeable  change 
     I was holding her in my arms and gazing into her eyes 
     Imperceptibly  almost instinctively  I began to pull her hands together behind her back at the same time searching the room with my eyes  I needed something with which to tie her hands 
     Suddenly she jerked her elbows together  and there followed a powerful recoil  I resisted for barely a second  Thrown backwards and almost lifted off my feet  even had I been an athlete I could not have freed myself  Rheya straightened up and dropped her arms to her sides  Her face  lit by an uncertain smile  had played no part in the struggle 
     She was gazing at me with the same calm interest as when I had first awakened   as though she was utterly unmoved by my desperate ploy  as though she was quite unaware that anything had happened  and had not noticed my sudden panic  She stood before me  waiting   grave  passive  mildly surprised 
     Leaving Rheya in the middle of the room  I went over to the washbasin  I was a prisoner  caught in an absurd trap from which at all costs I was determined to escape  I would have been incapable of putting into words the meaning of what had happened or what was going through my mind  but now I realized that my situation was identical with that of the other inhabitants of the Station  that everything I had experienced  discovered or guessed at was part of a single whole  terrifying and incomprehensible  Meanwhile  I was racking my brain to think up some ruse  to work out some means of escape  Without turning round  I could feel Rheyas eyes following me  There was a medicine chest above the basin  Quickly I went through its contents  and found a bottle of sleeping pills  I shook out four tablets   the maximum dose   into a glass  and filled it with hot water  I made little effort to conceal my actions from Rheya  Why  I did not even bother to ask myself 
     When the tablets had dissolved  I returned to Rheya  who was still standing in the same place 
 Are you angry with me   she asked  in a low voice 
 No  Drink this  
   Unconsciously  I had known all along that she would obey me  She took the glass without a word and drank the scalding mixture in one gulp  Putting down the empty glass on a stool  I went and sat in a chair in the corner of the room 
     Rheya joined me  squatting on the floor in her accustomed manner with her legs folded under her  and tossing back her hair  I was no longer under any illusion  this was not Rheya   and yet I recognized her every habitual gesture  Horror gripped me by the throat  and what was most horrible was that I must go on tricking her  pretending to take her for Rheya  while she herself sincerely believed that she was Rheya   of that I was certain  if one could be certain of anything any longer 
     She was leaning against my knees  her hair brushing my hand  We remained thus for some while  From time to time  I glanced at my watch  Half an hour went by  the sleeping tablets should have started to work  Rheya murmured something 
      What did you say  
     There was no reply 
     Although I attributed her silence to the onset of sleep  secretly I doubted the effectiveness of the pills  Once again  I did not ask myself why  Perhaps it was because my subterfuge seemed too simple 
     Slowly her head slid across my knees  her dark hair falling over her face  Her breathing grew deeper and more regular  she was asleep  I stooped in order to lift her on to the bed  As I did so  her eyes opened  she put her arms round my neck and burst into shrill laughter 
     I was dumbfounded  Rheya could hardly contain her mirth  With an expression that was at once ingenuous and sly  she observed me through half closed eyelids  I sat down again  tense  stupefied  at a loss  With a final burst of laughter  she snuggled against my legs 
     In an expressionless voice  I asked 
      Why are your laughing  
     Once again  a look of anxiety and surprise came over her face  It was clear that she wanted to give me an honest explanation  She sighed  and rubbed her nose like a child 
 I dont know   she said at last  with genuine puzzlement   Im behaving like an idiot  arent I  But so are you       you look idiotic  all stiff and pompous like       like Pelvis  
     I could hardly believe my ears 
      Like who  
      Like Pelvis  You know who I mean  that fat man         
     Rheya could not possibly have known Pelvis  or even heard me mention him  for the simple reason that he had returned from an expedition three years after her death  I had not known him previously and was therefore unaware of his inveterate habit  when 
presiding over meetings at the Institute  of letting sessions drag on indefinitely  Moreover  his name was Pelle Villis and until his return I did not know that he had been nicknamed Pelvis 
     Rheya leaned her elbows on my knees and looked me in the eyes  I put out my hand and stroked her arms  her shoulders and the base of her bare neck  which pulsed beneath my fingers  While it looked as though I was caressing her  and indeed  judging by her expression  that was how she interpreted the touch of my hands  in reality I was verifying once again that her body was warm to the touch  an ordinary human body  with muscles  bones  joints  Gazing calmly into her eyes  I felt a hideous desire to tighten my grip 
     Suddenly I remembered Snows bloodstained hands  and let go 
      How you stare at me   Rheya said  placidly 
     My heart was beating so furiously that I was incapable of speech  I closed my eyes  In that very instant  complete in every detail  a plan of action sprang to my mind  There was not a second to lose  I stood up 
      I must go out  Rheya  If you absolutely insist on coming with me  Ill take you         Good  
     She jumped to her feet 
     I opened the locker and selected a suit for each of us  Then I asked   Why are you bare foot   She answered hesitantly 
 I dont know       I must have left my shoes somewhere  
     I did not pursue the matter 
      Youll have to take your dress off to put this on  
      Flying overalls  What for  
     As she tried to take off her dress  an extraordinary fact became apparent  there were no zips  or fastenings of any sort  the red buttons down the front were merely decorative  Rheya smiled  embarrassed 
     As though it were the most normal way of going about it  I picked up some kind of scalpel from the floor and slit the dress down the back from neck to waist  so that she could pull it over her head 
     When she had put on the flying overalls  which were slightly too large for her  and we were about to leave  she asked 
      Are we going on a flight  
     I merely nodded  I was afraid of running into Snow  But the dome was empty and the door leading to the radio cabin was shut 
     A deathly silence still hung over the hangar deck  Rheya followed my movements attentively  I opened a stall and examined the shuttle vehicle inside  I checked  one after another  the micro reactor  the controls  and the diffusers  Then  having removed the empty capsule from its stand  I aimed the electric trolley towards the sloping runway 
     I had chosen a small shuttle used for ferrying stores between the Station and the satellite  one that did not normally carry personnel since it did not open from the inside   The choice was carefully calculated in accordance with my plan  Of course  I had no intention of launching it  but I simulated the preparations for an actual departure  Rheya  who had so often accompanied me on my space flights  was familiar with the preliminary routine  Inside the cockpit  I checked that the climatization and oxygensupply systems were functioning  I switched in the main circuit and the indicators on the instrument panel lit up  I climbed out and said to Rheya  who was waiting at the foot of the ladder 
      Get in  
      What about you  
      Ill follow you  I have to close the hatch behind us  
     She gave no sign that she suspected any trickery  When she had disappeared inside  I stuck my head into the opening and asked 
      Are you comfortable  
     I heard a muffled  yes  from inside the confined cockpit  I withdrew my head and slammed the hatch to with all my strength  I slid home the two bolts and tightened the five safety screws with the special spanner I had brought with me  The slender metal cigar stood there  pointing upwards  as though it were really about to take off into space 
     Its captive was in no danger  the oxygen tanks were full and there were food supplies in the cockpit  In any case  I did not intend to keep her prisoner indefinitely  I desperately needed two hours of freedom in order to concentrate on the decisions which had to be taken and to work out a joint plan of action with Snow 
     As I was tightening the last screw but one  I felt a vibration in the three pronged clamp which held the base of the shuttle  I thought I must have loosened the support in my over eager handling of the heavy spanner  but when I stepped back to take a look  I was greeted by a spectacle which I hope I shall never have to see again 
     The whole vehicle trembled  shaken from the inside as though by some superhuman force  Not even a steel robot could have imparted such a convulsive tremor to an 8 ton mass  and yet the cabin contained only a frail  dark haired girl 
     The reflections from the lights quivered on the shuttles gleaming sides  I could not hear the blows  there was no sound whatever from inside the vehicle  But the outspread struts vibrated like taut wires  The violence of the shock waves was such that I was afraid the entire scaffolding would collapse 
     I tightened the final screw with a trembling hand  threw down the spanner and jumped off the ladder  As I slowly retreated  I noticed that the shock absorbers  designed to resist a continuous pressure  were vibrating furiously  It looked to me as though the shuttles outer skin was wrinkling 
     Frenziedly  I rushed to the control panel and with both hands lifted the starting lever  As I did so the intercom connected to the shuttles interior gave out a piercing sound   not a cry  but a sound which bore not the slightest resemblance to the human voice  in which I could nevertheless just make out my name  repeated over and over again   Kris  Kris  Kris  
     I had attacked the controls so violently  fumbling in my haste  that my fingers were torn and bleeding 
     A bluish glimmer  like that of a ghostly dawn  lit up the walls  Swirling clouds of vaporous dust eddied round the launching pad  the dust turned into a column of fierce sparks and the echoes of a thunderous roar drowned all other noise  Three flames  merging instantly into a single pillar of fire  lifted the craft  which rose up through the open hatch in the dome  leaving behind a glowing trail which rippled as it gradually subsided  Shutters slid over the hatch  and the automatic ventilators began to suck in the acrid smoke which billowed round the room 
     It was only later that I remembered all these details  at the time  I hardly knew what I was seeing   Clinging to the control panel  the fierce heat burning my face and singeing my hair  I gulped the acrid air which smelt of a mixture of burning fuel and the ozone given off by ionization  I had instinctively closed my eyes at the moment of lift off  but the glare had penetrated my eyelids  For some time  I saw nothing but black  red and gold spirals which slowly died away  The ventilators continued to hum  the smoke and the dust were gradually clearing 
     The green glow of the radar screen caught my eye  My hands flew across its controls as I began to search for the shuttle  By the time I had located it  it was already flying above the atmosphere  I had never launched a vehicle in such a blind and unthinking way  with no pre set speed or direction  I did not even know its range and was afraid of causing some unpredictable disaster  I judged that the easiest thing to do would be to place it in a stationary orbit around Solaris and then cut the engines  I verified from the tables that the required altitude was 725 miles  It was no guarantee  of course  but I could see no other way out 
     I did not have the heart to switch on the intercom  which had been disconnected at lift off  I could not bear to expose myself again to the sound of that horrifying voice  which was no longer even remotely human 
     I felt I was justified in thinking that I had defeated the simulacra  and that behind the illusion  contrary to all expectation  I had found the real Rheya again   the Rheya of my memories  whom the hypothesis of madness would have destroyed 
     At one oclock  I left the hangar deck
