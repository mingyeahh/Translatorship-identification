i have no idea how long i had been lying in the dark  staring at the luminous dial of my wristwatch  hearing myself breathing  i felt a vague surprise  but my underlying feeling was one of profound indifference both to this ring of phosphorescent figures and to my own surprise  i told myself that the feeling was caused by fatigue  when i turned over  the bed seemed wider than usual  i held my breath  no sound broke the silence  rheyas breathing should have been audible  i reached out  but felt nothing  i was alone 
     i was about to call her name  when i heard the tread of heavy footsteps coming towards me  a numb calm descended 
      gibarian  
      yes  its me  dont switch the light on  
      no  
      theres no need  and its better for us to stay in the dark  
      but you are dead       
      dont let that worry you  you recognize my voice  dont you  
      yes  why did you kill yourself  
      i had no choice  you arrived four days late  if you had come earlier  i would not have been forced to kill myself  dont worry about it  though  i dont regret anything  
      you really are there  im not asleep  
      oh  you think youre dreaming about me  as you did with rheya  
      where is she   
      how should i know  
      i have a feeling that you do  
      keep your feelings for yourself  lets say im deputizing for her  
      i want her here too  
      not possible  
 why not  you know very well that it isnt the real you  just my       
    no  i am the real gibarian   just a new incarnation  but lets not waste time on useless chatter  
      youll be leaving again  
      yes  
      and then shell come back  
      why should you care about that  
      she belongs to me  
      you are afraid of her  
      no  
      she disgusts you  
      what do you want with me  
      save your pity for yourself   you have a right to it   but not for her  she will always be twenty years old  you must know that  
     i felt suddenly at ease again  for no apparent reason  and ready to hear him out  he seemed to have come closer  though i could not see him in the dark 
      what do you want  
      sartorius has convinced snow that you have been deceiving him  right now they are trying to give you the same treatment  building the x ray beamer is a cover for constructing a magnetic field disruptor  
      where is she  
      didnt you hear me  i came to warn you  
      where is she  
      i dont know  be careful  you must find some kind of weapon  you cant trust anyone  
      i can trust rheya  
     he stifled a laugh   of course  you can trust rheya   to some extent  and you can always follow my example  if all else fails  
      you are not gibarian  
      no  then who am i  a dream  
      no  you are only a puppet  but you dont realize that you are  
      and how do you know what  you  are  
     i tried to stand up  but could not stir  although gibarian was still speaking  i could not understand his words  there was only the drone of his voice  i struggled to regain control of my body  felt a sudden wrench and       i woke up  and drew down great gulps of air  it was dark  and i had been having a nightmare  and now i heard a distant  monotonous voice         a dilemma that we are not equipped to solve  we are the cause of our own sufferings  the polytheres behave strictly as a kind of amplifier of our own thoughts  any attempt to understand the motivation of these occurrences is blocked by our own anthropomorphism  where there are no men  there cannot be motives accessible to men  before we can proceed with our research  either our own thoughts or their materialized forms must be destroyed  it is not within our power to destroy our thoughts  as for destroying their material forms  that could be like committing murder  
     i had recognized gibarians voice at once  when i stretched out my arm  i found myself alone  i had fallen asleep again  this was another dream  i called gibarians name  and the voice stopped in mid sentence  there was the sound of a faint gasp  then a gust of air 
      well  gibarian   i yawned   you seem to be following me out of one dream and into the next       
     there was a rustling sound from somewhere close  and i called his name again  the bed springs creaked  and a voice whispered in my ear 
      kris       its me       
      rheya  is it you  what about gibarian  
 but       you said he was dead  kris  
    he can be alive in a dream   i told her dejectedly  although i was not completely sure that it had been a dream   he spoke to me       he was here       
     my head sank back onto the pillow  rheya said something  but i was already drifting into sleep 
     in the red light of morning  the events of the previous night returned  i had dreamt that i was talking to gibarian  but afterwards  i could swear that i had heard his voice  although i had no clear recall of what he had said  and it had not been a conversation   more like a speech 
     rheya was splashing about in the bathroom  i looked under the bed  where i had hidden the tape recorder a few days earlier  it was no longer there 
      rheya   she put her face round the door   did you see a tape recorder under the bed  a little pocket one  
      there was a pile of stuff under the bed  i put it all over there   she pointed to a shelf by the medicine cabinet  and disappeared back into the bathroom 
     there was no tape recorder on the shelf  and when rheya emerged from the bathroom i asked her to think again  she sat combing her hair  and did not answer  it was not until now that i noticed how pale she was  and how closely she was watching me in the mirror  i returned to the attack 
      the tape recorder is missing  rheya  
      is that all you have to tell me  
      im sorry  youre right  its silly to get so worked up about a tape recorder  
     anything to avoid a quarrel 
     later  over breakfast  the change in rheyas behavior was obvious  yet i could not define it  she did not meet my eyes  and was frequently so lost in thought that she did not hear me  once  when she looked up  her cheeks were damp 
      is anything the matter  youre crying  
      leave me alone   rheya blurted   they arent real tears  
     perhaps i ought not to have let her answer so  but straight talking was the last thing i wanted  in any case  i had other problems on my mind  i had dreamt that snow and  sartorius were plotting against me  and although i was certain that it had been nothing more than a dream  i was wondering if there was anything on the station that i might be able to use to defend myself  my thinking had not progressed to the point of deciding what to do with a weapon once i had it  i told rheya that i had to make an inspection of the store rooms  and she trailed behind me silently 
     i ransacked packing cases and capsules  and when we reached the lower deck i was unable to resist looking into the cold store  not wanting rheya to go in  i put my head inside the door and looked around  the recumbent figure was still covered by its dark shroud  but from my position in the doorway i could not make out whether the black woman was still sleeping by gibarians body  i had the impression that she was no longer there 
     i wandered from one store room to another  unable to locate anything that might serve as a weapon  and with a rising feeling of depression  all at once i noticed that rheya was not with me  then she reappeared  she had been hanging back in the corridor  in spite of the pain she suffered when she could not see me  she had been trying to keep away  i should have been astonished  instead  i went on acting as if i had been offended   but then  who had offended me    and sulking like a child 
     my head was throbbing  and i rifled the entire contents of the medicine cabinet without finding so much as an aspirin  i did not want to go back to the sick bay  i did not want to do anything  i had never been in a blacker temper  rheya tiptoed about the cabin like a shadow  now and then she went off somewhere  i dont know where  i was paying her no attention  then she would creep back inside 
     that afternoon  in the kitchen  we had just eaten  but in fact rheya had not touched her food  and i had not attempted to persuade her   rheya got up and came to sit next to me  i felt her hand on my sleeve  and grunted   whats the matter  
     i had been meaning to go up to the deck above  as the pipes were carrying the sharp crackling sound of high voltage apparatus in use  but rheya would have had to come with me  it had been hard enough to justify her presence in the library  among the machinery  there was a chance that snow might drop some clumsy remark  i gave up the idea of going to investigate 
      kris   she whispered   whats happening to us  
      i gave an involuntary sigh of frustration with everything that had been happening since the previous night   everything is fine  why   
 i want to talk  
      all right  im listening  
      not like this  
      what  you know i have a head ache  and thats not the least of my worries       
      youre not being fair  
     i forced myself to smile  it must have been a poor imitation   go ahead and talk  darling  please  
      will you tell me the truth  
      why should i lie   this was an ominous beginning  
      you might have your reasons       it might be necessary       but if you want       look  i am going to tell you something  and then it will be your turn   only no halftruths  promise   i could not meet her gaze   ive already told you that i dont know how i came to be here  perhaps you do  wait    perhaps you dont  but if you do know  and you cant tell me now  will you tell me one day  later on  i couldnt be any the worse for it  and you would at least be giving me a chance  
      what are you talking about  child   i stammered   what chance  
      kris  whatever i may be  im certainly not a child  you promised me an answer  
     whatever i may be       my throat tightened  and i stared at rheya shaking my head like an imbecile  as if forbidding myself to hear any more 
      im not asking for explanations  you only need to tell me that  you are not allowed to say  
      im not hiding anything   i croaked 
      all right  
     she stood up  i wanted to say something  we could not leave it at that  but no words would come   rheya       
     she was standing at the window  with her back turned  the blue black ocean stretched out under a cloudless sky 
      rheya  if you believe       you know very well i love you       
      me  
     i went to put my arms round her  but she pulled away 
      youre too kind   she said   you say you love me  id rather you beat me  
      rheya  darling  
      no  no  dont say any more  
     she went back to the table and began to clear away the plates  i gazed out at the ocean  the sun was setting  and the station cast a lengthening shadow that danced on the waves  rheya dropped a plate on the floor  water splashed in the sink  a tarnished golden halo ringed the horizon  if i only knew what to do      if only       suddenly there was silence  rheya was standing behind me 
      no  dont turn round   she murmured   it isnt your fault  i know  dont torment yourself  
     i reached out  but she slipped away to the far side of the room and picked up a stack of plates   its a shame theyre unbreakable  id like to smash them  all of them  
     i thought for a moment that she really was going to dash them to the floor  but she looked across at me and smiled   dont worry  im not going to make scenes  
     in the middle of the night  i was suddenly wide awake  the room was in darkness and the door was ajar  with a faint light shining from the corridor  there was a shrill hissing noise  interspersed with heavy  muffled thudding  as if some heavy object was pounding against a wall  a meteor had pierced the shell of the station  no  not a meteor  a shuttle  for i could hear a dreadful labored whining        
     i shook myself  it was not a meteor  nor was it a shuttle  the sound was coming from somebody at the end of the corridor  i ran down to where light was pouring from the door of the little work room  and rushed inside  a freezing vapor filled the room  my breath fell like snow  and white flakes swirled over a body covered by a dressing gown  stirring feebly then striking the floor again  i could hardly see through the freezing mist  i snatched her up and folded her in my arms  and the dressing gown burnt my skin 
   rheya kept on making the same harsh gasping sound as i stumbled along the corridor  no longer feeling the cold  only her breath on my neck  burning like fire 
     i lowered rheya onto the operating table and pulled the dressing gown open  her face was contorted with pain  the lips covered by a thick  black layer of frozen blood  the tongue a mass of sparkling ice crystals 
     liquid oxygen       the dewar bottles in the work room contained liquid oxygen  splinters of glass had crunched underfoot as i carried rheya out  how much of it had she swallowed  it didnt matter  her trachea  throat and lungs must be burnt away   liquid oxygen corrodes flesh more effectively than strong acids  her breathing was more and more labored  with a dry sound like tearing paper  her eyes were closed  she was dying 
     i looked across at the big  glass fronted cabinets  crammed with instruments and drugs  tracheotomy  intubation  she had no lungs  i stared at shelves full of colored bottles and cartons  she went on  gasping hoarsely  and a wisp of vapor drifted out of her open mouth 
     thermophores      
     i started looking for them  then changed my mind  ran to another cupboard and turned out boxes of ampoules  now a hypodermic   where are they    here   needs sterilizing  i fumbled with the lid of the sterilizer  but my numb fingers had lost all sensation and would not bend 
     the harsh rattle grew louder  and rheyas eyes were open when i reached the table  i opened my mouth to say her name but my voice had gone and my lips would not obey me  my face did not belong to me  it was a plaster mask 
     rheyas ribs were heaving under the white skin  the ice crystals had melted and her wet hair was entangled in the headrest  and she was looking at me 
      rheya   it was all i could say  i stood paralyzed  my hands dangling uselessly  until a burning sensation mounted from my legs and attacked my lips and eyelids 
     a drop of blood melted and slanted down her cheek  her tongue quivered and receded  the labored panting went on 
     i could feel no pulse in her wrist  and put my ear against her frozen breast  faintly  behind the raging blizzard  her heart was beating so fast that i could not count the beats  and i remained crouched over her  with my eyes closed  something brushed my head   rheyas hand in my hair  i stood up 
      kris   a harsh gasp 
     i took her hand  and the answering pressure made my bones creak  then her face screwed up with agony  and she lost consciousness again  her eyes turned up  a guttural rattle tore at her throat  and her body arched with convulsions  it was all i could do to keep her on the operating table  she broke free and her head cracked against a porcelain basin  i dragged her back  and struggled to hold her down  but violent spasms kept jerking her out of my grasp  i was pouring with sweat  and my legs were like jelly  when the convulsions abated  i tried to make her lie flat  but her chest thrust out to gulp at the air  suddenly her eyes were staring out at me from behind the frightful bloodstained mask of her face   kris       how long       how long   she choked  pink foam appeared at her mouth  and the convulsions racked her again  with my last reserves of strength i bore down on her shoulders  and she fell back  her teeth chattered loudly 
      no  no  no   she whimpered suddenly  and i thought that death was near 
     but the spasms resumed  and again i had to hold her down  now and then she swallowed drily  and her ribs heaved  then the eyelids half closed over the unseeing eyes  and she stiffened  this must be the end  i did not even try to wipe the foam from her mouth  a distant ringing throbbed in my head  i was waiting for her final breath before my strength failed and i collapsed to the ground 
     she went on breathing  and the rasp was now only a light sigh  her chest  which had stopped heaving  moved again to the rapid rhythm of her heartbeat  color was returning to her cheeks  still i did not realize what was happening  my hands were clammy  and i heard as if through layers of cotton wool  yet the ringing sound continued  rheyas eyelids moved  and our eyes met 
     i could not speak her name from behind the mask of my face  all i could do was look at her 
     she turned her head and looked round the room  somewhere behind me  in another world  a tap dripped  rheya levered herself up on her elbow  i recoiled  and again our eyes met 
      it       it didnt work   she stammered   why are you looking at me like that   then she screamed out loud   why are you looking at me like that  
     still i could say nothing  she examined her hands  moved her fingers      
 is this me  
     my lips formed her name  and she repeated it as a question    rheya  
     she let herself slide off the operating table  staggered  regained her balance and took a few steps  she was moving in a daze  and looking at me without appearing to see me 
      rheya  but       i am not rheya  who am i then  and you  what about you   her eyes widened and sparkled  and an astonished smile lit up her face   and you  kris  perhaps you too       
     i had backed away until i came up against the wall  the smile vanished 
      no  you are afraid  i cant take any more of this  i cant       i didnt know  i still dont understand  its not possible   her clenched fists struck her chest   what else could i think  except that i was rheya  maybe you believe this is all an act  it isnt  i swear it isnt  
     something snapped in my mind  and i went to put my arms round her  but she fought free 
      dont touch me  leave me alone  i disgust you  i know i do  keep away  im not rheya       
     we screamed at each other and rheya tried to keep me at arms length  i would not let her go  and at last she let her head fall to my shoulder  we were on our knees  breathless and exhausted 
      kris       what do i have to do to put a stop to this  
      be quiet  
      you dont know   she lifted her head and stared at me   it cant be done  can it         please         
      i really tried       no  go away  i disgust you   and myself  i disgust myself  if i only knew how       
      you would kill yourself  
      yes  
      but i want you to stay alive  i want you here  more than anything  
      youre lying  
      tell me what i have to do to convince you  you are here  you exist  i cant see any further than that  
      it cant possibly be true  because i am not rheya  
      then who are you  
     there was a long silence  then she bowed her head and murmured 
      rheya       but i know that i am not the woman you once loved  
      yes  but that was a long time ago  that past does not exist  but you do  here and now  dont you see  
     she shook her head 
      i know that it was kindness that made you behave as you did  but there is nothing to be done  that first morning when i found myself waiting by your bed for you to wake up  i knew nothing  i can hardly believe it was only three days ago  i behaved like a lunatic  everything was misty  i didnt remember anything  wasnt surprised by anything  it was like recovering from a drugged sleep  or a long illness  it even occurred to me that i might have been ill and you didnt want to tell me  then a few things happened to set me thinking   you know what i mean  so after you met that man in the library and you refused to tell me anything  i made up my mind to listen to that tape  that was the only time i have lied to you  kris  when you were looking for the tape recorder  i knew where it was  id hidden it  the man who recorded the tape   what was his name  
      gibarian  
      yes  gibarian   he explained everything  although i still dont understand  the only thing missing was that i cant       that there is no end  he didnt mention that  or if he did it was after you woke up and i had to switch off  but i heard enough to realize that i am not a human being  only an instrument  
      what are you talking about  
    thats what i am  to study your reactions   something of that sort  each one of you has a       an instrument like me  we emerge from your memory or your imagination  i cant say exactly   anyway you know better than i  he talks about such terrible things       so far fetched       if it did not fit in with everything else i would certainly have refused to believe him  
      the rest  
      oh  things like not needing sleep  and being compelled to go wherever you go  when i think that only yesterday i was miserable because i thought you detested me  how stupid  but how could i have imagined the truth  he   gibarian   didnt hate that woman  the one who came to him  but he refers to her in such a dreadful way  it wasnt until then that i realized that i was helpless whatever i did  and that i couldnt avoid torturing you  more than that though  an instrument of torture is passive  like the stone that falls on somebody and kills them  but an instrument of torture which loves you and wishes you nothing but good   it was too much for me  i wanted to tell you the little that i  had  understood  i told myself that it might be useful to you  i even tried to make notes         
      that time when you had the light switched on  
      yes  but i couldnt write anything  i searched myself for       you know  some sign of influence       i was going mad  i felt as if there was no body underneath my skin and there was something else instead  as if i was just an illusion meant to mislead you  you see  
      i see  
      when you cant sleep at night and your mind keeps spinning for hours on end  it can take you far away  you find yourself moving in strange directions       
      i know what you mean  
      but i could feel my heart beating  and then i remembered that you had made an analysis of my blood  what did you find  you can tell me the truth now  
      your blood is like my own  
      truly  
      i give you my word  
      what does that indicate  i had been telling myself that the       unknown force might be concealed somewhere inside me  and that it might not occupy very much space  but i did not know whereabouts it was  i think now that i was evading the real issue because i didnt have the nerve to make a decision  i was afraid  and i looked for a way out  but kris  if my blood is like yours       if i really       no  its impossible  i would already be dead  wouldnt i  that means there really is something different   but where  in the mind  yet it seems to me that i think as any human being does       and i know nothing  if that alien thing was thinking in my head  i would know everything  and i would not love you  i would be pretending  and aware that i was pretending  kris  youve got to tell me everything you know  perhaps we could work out a solution between us  
      what kind of solution   she fell silent   is it death you want  
      yes  i think it is  
     again silence  rheya sat on the floor  her knees drawn up under her chin  i looked around at the white enamelled fittings and gleaming instruments  perhaps looking for some unsuspected clue to suddenly materialize 
      rheya  i have something to say  too   she waited quietly   it is true that we are not exactly alike  but there is nothing wrong with that  in any case  whatever else we might think about it  that       difference       saved your life  
     a painful smile flickered over her face   does that mean that i am       immortal  
      i dont know  at any rate  youre far less vulnerable than i am  
      its horrible         
      perhaps not as horrible as you think  
      but you dont envy me  
      rheya  i dont know what your fate will be  it cannot be predicted  any more than my own or any other members of the stations personnel  the experiment will go on  and anything can happen       
      or nothing  
      or nothing  and i have to confess that nothing is what i would prefer  not because 
im frightened   though fear is undeniably an element of this business   but because there cant be any final outcome  im quite sure of that  
      outcome  you mean the ocean  
      yes  contact with the ocean  as i see it  the problem is basically very simple  contact means the exchange of specific knowledge  ideas  or at least of findings  definite facts  but what if no exchange is possible  if an elephant is not a giant microbe  the ocean is not a giant brain  obviously there can be various approaches  and the consequence of one of them is that you are here  now  with me  and i am trying my hardest to make you realize that i love you  just your being here cancels out the twelve years of my life that went into the study of solaris  and i want to keep you 
      you may have been sent to torment me  or to make my life happier  or as an instrument ignorant of its function  used like a microscope with me on the slide  possibly you are here as a token of friendship  or a subtle punishment  or even as a joke  it could be all of those at once  or   which is more probable   something else completely  if you say that our future depends on the oceans intentions  i cant deny it  i cant tell the future any more than you can  i cant even swear that i shall always love you  after what has happened already  we can expect anything  suppose tomorrow it turns me into a green jellyfish  its out of our hands  but the decision we make today is in our hands  lets decide to stay together  what do you say  
      listen kris  theres something else i must ask you       am i       do i look very like her  
      you did at first  now i dont know  
      i dont understand  
      now all i see is you  
      youre sure  
      yes  if you really were her  i might not be able to love you  
      why  
      because of what i did  
      did you treat her badly   
      yes  when we       
      dont say any more  
      why not  
      so that you wont forget that i am the one who is here not her
