 i was lying on my back  with rheyas head resting on my shoulder 
     the darkness was peopled now  i could hear footsteps  something was piling up above me  higher and higher  infinitely high  the night transfixed me  the night took possession of me  enveloped and penetrated me  impalpable  insubstantial  turned to stone  i had ceased breathing  there was no air to breathe  as though from a distance  i heard the beating of my heart  i summoned up all my remaining strength  straining every nerve  and waited for death  i went on waiting       i seemed to be growing smaller  and the invisible sky  horizonless  the formless immensity of space  without clouds  without stars  receded  extended and grew bigger all round me  i tried to crawl out of bed  but there was no bed  beneath the cover of darkness there was a void  i pressed my hands to my face  i no longer had any fingers or any hands  i wanted to scream      
     the room floated in a blue penumbra  which outlined the furniture and the laden bookshelves  and drained everything of color  a pearly whiteness flooded the window 
     i was drenched with sweat  i glanced to one side  rheya was gazing at me 
     she raised her head 
      has your arm gone to sleep  
     her eyes too had been drained of color  they were grey  but luminous  beneath the black lashes 
      what   her murmured words had seemed like a caress even before i understood their meaning   no  ah  yes   i said  at last 
     i put my hand on her shoulder  i had pins and needles in my fingers 
      did you have a bad dream   she asked 
      i drew her to me with my other hand  
      a dream  yes  i was dreaming  and you  didnt you sleep  
      i dont know  i dont think so  im sleepy  but that mustnt stop you from sleeping       why are you looking at me like that  
     i closed my eyes  her heart was beating against mine  her heart  a mere appendage  i told myself  but nothing surprised me any longer  not even my own indifference  i had crossed the frontiers of fear and despair  i had come a long way   further than anyone had ever come before 
     i raised myself on my elbow  daybreak       and the peace that comes with dawn  a silent storm had set the cloudless horizon ablaze  a streak of light  the first ray of the blue sun  penetrated the room and broke up into sharp edged reflections  there was a crossfire of sparks  which coruscated off the mirror  the door handles  the nickel pipes  the light scattered  falling on to every smooth surface as though it wanted to conquer ever more space  to set the room alight  i looked at rheya  the pupils of her grey eyes had contracted 
     she asked in an expressionless voice   is the night over already  
      night never lasts long here  
      and us  
      what about us  
      are we going to stay here long  
     coming from her  the question had its comic side  but when i spoke  my voice held no trace of gaiety 
      quite a long time  probably  why  dont you want to stay here  
     her eyes did not blink  she was looking at me inquiringly  did i see her blink  i was not sure  she drew back the blanket and i saw the little pink scar on her arm 
      why are you looking at me like that  
      because youre very beautiful  
     she smiled  without a trace of mischief  modestly acknowledging my compliment 
      really  its as though       as though       
      what  
      as though you were doubtful of something  
      what nonsense  
      as though you didnt trust me and i were hiding something from you       
      rubbish  
      by the way youre denying it  i can tell im right  
     the light became blinding  shading my eyes with my hand  i looked for my dark glasses  they were on the table  when i was back by her side  rheya smiled 
      what about me  
     it took me a minute to understand what she meant
      dark glasses  
     i got up and began to hunt through drawers and shelves  pushing aside books and instruments  i found two pairs of glasses  which i gave to rheya  they were too big  they fell half way down her nose 
     the shutters slid over the window  it was dark once more  groping  i helped rheya remove her glasses and put both pairs down under the bed 
      what shall we do now   she asked 
      at night time  one sleeps  
      kris       
      yes  
      do you want a compress for your forehead  
      no  thanks  thank you       my darling  
     i dont know why i had added those two words  in the darkness  i took her by her graceful shoulders  i felt them tremble  and i knew  without the least shadow of doubt  that i held rheya in my arms  or rather  i understood in that moment that she was not trying to deceive me  it was i who was deceiving her  since she sincerely believed herself to be rheya 
     i dropped off several times after that  and each time an anguished start jolted me awake  panting  exhausted  i pressed myself closer to her  my heart gradually growing calmer  she touched me cautiously on the cheeks and forehead with the tips of her fingers  to see whether or not i was feverish  it was rheya  the real rheya  the one and only rheya 
     a change came over me  i ceased to struggle and almost at once i fell asleep 
     i was awakened by an agreeable sensation of coolness  my face was covered by a damp cloth  i pulled it off and found rheya leaning over me  she was smiling and squeezing out a second cloth over a bowl 
      what a sleep   she said  laying another compress on my forehead   are you ill         no  
     i wrinkled my forehead  the skin was supple once again  rheya sat on the edge of my bed  her black hair brushed back over the collar of a bathrobe   a mans bathrobe  with orange and black stripes  the sleeves turned back to the elbow 
     i was terribly hungry  it was at least twenty hours since my last meal  when rheya had finished her ministrations i got up  two dresses  draped over the back of a chair caught my eye   two absolutely identical white dresses  each decorated with a row of red buttons  i myself had helped rheya out of one of them  and she had reappeared  yesterday evening  dressed in the second  she followed my glance 
      i had to cut the seam open with scissors   she said   i think the zip fastener must have got stuck  
     the sight of the two identical dresses filled me with a horror which exceeded anything i had felt hitherto  rheya was busy tidying up the medicine chest  i turned my back and bit my knuckles  unable to take my eyes off the two dresses   or rather the original dress and its double   i backed towards the door  the basin tap was running noisily  i opened the door and  slipping out of the room  cautiously closed it behind me  i heard the sound of running water  the clinking of bottles  then  suddenly  all sound ceased  i waited  my jaw clenched  my hands gripping the door handle  but with little hope of holding it shut  it was nearly torn from my grasp by a savage jerk  but the door did not open  it shook and vibrated from top to bottom  dazed  i let go of the handle and stepped back  the panel  made of some plastic material  caved in as though an invisible person at my side had tried to break into the room  the steel frame bent further and further inwards and the paint was cracking  suddenly i understood  instead of pushing the door  which opened outwards  rheya was trying to open it by pulling it towards her  the reflection of the lighting strip in the ceiling was distorted in the white painted door panel  there was a resounding crack and the panel  forced beyond its limits  gave way  simultaneously the handle vanished  torn from its mounting  two bloodstained hands appeared  thrusting through the opening and smearing the white paint with blood  the door split in two  the broken halves hanging askew on their hinges  first a face appeared  deathly pale  then a wild looking apparition  dressed in an orange and black bathrobe  flung itself sobbing upon my chest 
     i wanted to escape  but it was too late  and i was rooted to the spot  rheya was breathing convulsively  her dishevelled head drumming against my chest  before i could put my arms round her to hold her up  rheya collapsed 
     avoiding the ragged edges of the broken panel  i carried her into the room and laid her on the bed  her fingertips were grazed and the nails torn  when her hands turned upwards  i saw that the palms were cut to the bone  i examined her face  her glazed eyes showed no sign of recognition 
      rheya  
     the only answer was an inarticulate groan 
     i went over to the medicine chest  the bed creaked  i turned round  rheya was sitting up  looking at her bleeding hands with astonishment 
      kris   she sobbed   i       i       what happened to me  
      you hurt yourself trying to break down the door   i answered curtly 
     my lips were twitching convulsively  and i had to bite the lower one to keep it under control 
     rheyas glance took in the pieces of door panel hanging from the steel frame  then she turned her eyes back towards me  she was doing her best to hide her terror  but i could see her chin trembling 
     i cut off some squares of gauze  picked up a pot of antiseptic powder and returned to the bedside  the glass jar slipped through my hands and shattered   but i no longer needed it 
     i lifted one of rheyas hands  the nails  still surrounded by traces of clotted blood  had regrown  there was a pink scar in the hollow of her palm  but even this scar was healing  disappearing in front of my eyes 
     i sat beside her and stroked her face  trying to smile without much success 
      what did you do that for  rheya  
      i did       that  
     with her eyes  she indicated the door 
      yes       dont you remember  
      no       that is  i saw you werent there  i was very frightened  and       
      and what  
      i looked for you  i thought that perhaps you were in the bathroom       
     only then did i notice that the sliding door covering the entrance to the bathroom had been pushed back        and then  
      i ran to the door  
      and after that  
      i cant remember       something must have happened
      what  
      i dont know  
      what do you remember  
      i was sitting here  on the bed  
     she swung her legs over the edge of the bed  got up and went over to the shattered door 
      kris  
     walking up behind her  i took her by the shoulders  she was shaking  she suddenly turned and whispered 
      kris  kris       
      calm yourself  
 kris  if its me       kris  am i an epileptic  
 what an extraordinary idea  my sweet  the doors in this place are rather special       
   we left the room as the shutter was grinding its way up the window  the blue sun was sinking into the ocean 
     i guided rheya to the small kitchen on the other side of the dome  together we raided the cupboards and the refrigerators  i soon noticed that rheya was scarcely better than i was at cooking or even at opening tins  i devoured the contents of two tins and drank innumerable cups of coffee  rheya also ate  but as children eat when they are not hungry and do not want to displease their parents  on the other hand  she was not forcing herself  simply taking in nourishment automatically  indifferently 
     after our meal  we went into the sick bay  next to the radio cabin  i had had an idea  i told rheya that i wanted to give her a medical examination   a straightforward checkup   sat her in a mechanical chair  and took a syringe and some needles out of the sterilizer  i knew exactly where each object was to be found  as far as the model of the stations interior was concerned  the instructors had not overlooked a single detail during my training course  rheya held out her fingers  i took a sample of blood  i smeared the blood on to a slide which i laid in the suction pipe  introduced it into the vacuum tank and bombarded it with silver ions 
     performing a familiar task had a soothing effect  and i felt better  rheya  leaning back on the cushions in the mechanical chair  gazed around at the instruments in the sick bay 
     the buzzing of the videophone broke the silence  i lifted the receiver 
      kelvin  
     i looked at rheya  she was still quiet  apparently exhausted by her recent efforts 
     i heard a sigh of relief 
      at last  
     it was snow  i waited  the receiver pressed close to my ear 
      youve had a visit  havent you  
      yes  
      are you busy  
      yes  
      a little auscultation  eh  
      i suppose youve got a better suggestion   a game of chess maybe  
      dont be so touchy  kelvin  sartorius wants to meet you  he wants all three of us to meet  
      very kind of him   i answered  taken aback   but        i stopped  then went on   is he alone  
      no  i havent explained properly  he wants to have a talk with us  well set up a three way videophone link  but with the telescreen lenses covered  
      i see  why didnt he contact me himself  is he frightened of me  
      quite possibly   grunted snow   what do you say  
      a conference  in an hours time  will that suit you  
      thats fine  
     i could see him on the screen   just his face  about the size of a fist  for a moment  he looked at me attentively  i could hear the crackling of the electric current  then he said  hesitantly 
      are you getting on all right  
      not too bad  how about you  
      not so well as you  i dare say  may i         
      do you want to come over here  
     i glanced at rheya over my shoulder  she was leaning back  legs crossed  her head bent  with a morose air  she was fiddling mechanically with the little chrome ball on the end of a chain fixed to the arm rest 
snows voice erupted 
 stop that  do you hear  i told you to stop it  
   i could see his profile on the screen  but i could no longer hear him although his lips were moving   he had put his hand over the microphone 
      no  i cant come   he said quickly   later perhaps  in any case  ill contact you in an hour  
     the screen went blank  i replaced the receiver        who was it   asked rheya indifferently 
      snow  a cybernetician  you dont know him  
      is this going on much longer  
      are you bored  
     i put the first of the series of slides into the neutron microscope  and  one after another  i pressed the different colored switches  the magnetic fields rumbled hollowly        theres not much to do in here  and if my humble company isnt enough for you             i was talking distractedly  with long gaps between my words 
     i pulled the big black hood round the eye piece of the microscope towards me  and leaned my forehead against the resilient foam rubber viewer  i could hear rheyas voice  but without taking in what she was saying  beneath my gaze  sharply foreshortened  was a vast desert flooded with silvery light  and strewn with rounded boulders   red corpuscles   which trembled and wriggled behind a veil of mist  i focused the eyepiece and penetrated further into the depths of the silvery landscape  without taking my eyes away from the viewer  i turned the view finder  when a boulder  a single corpuscle  detached itself and appeared at the junction of the cross hairs  i enlarged the image  the lens had apparently picked up a deformed erythrocyte  sunken in the centre  whose uneven edges projected sharp shadows over the depths of a circular crater  the crater  bristling with silver ion deposits  extended beyond the microscopes field of vision  the nebulous outlines of threads of albumen  distorted and atrophied  appeared in the midst of an opalescent liquid  a worm of albumen twisted and turned beneath the cross hairs of the lens  gradually i increased the enlargement  at any moment  i should reach the limit of this exploration of the depths  the shadow of a molecule occupied the whole of the space  then the image became fuzzy 
     there was nothing to be seen  there should have been the ferment of a quivering cloud of atoms  but i saw nothing  a dazzling light filled the screen  which was flawlessly clear  i pushed the lever to its utmost  the angry  whirring noise grew louder  but the screen remained a blank  an alarm signal sounded once  then was repeated  the circuit was overloaded  i took a final look at the silvery desert  then i cut the current 
     i looked at rheya  she was in the middle of a yawn which she changed adroitly into a smile   am i in good health   she asked 
       excellent  couldnt be better   i continued to look at her and once more i felt as though something was crawling along my lower lip  what had happened exactly  what was the meaning of it  was this body  frail and weak in appearance but indestructible in reality  actually made of nothing  i gave the microscope cylinder a blow with my fist  was the instrument out of order  no  i knew that it was working perfectly  i had followed the procedure faithfully  first the cells  then the albumen  then the molecules  and everything was just as i was accustomed to seeing it in the course of examining thousands of slides  but the final step  into the heart of the matter  had taken me nowhere 
     i put a ligature on rheya  took some blood from a median vein and transferred it to a graduated glass  then divided it between several test tubes and began the analyses  these took longer than usual  i was rather out of practice  the reactions were normal  every one of them 
     i dropped some congealed acid on to a coral tinted pearl  smoke  the blood turned grey and a dirty foam rose to the surface  disintegration  decomposition  faster and faster  i turned my back to get another test tube  when i looked again at the experiment  i nearly dropped the slim glass phial 
     beneath the skin of dirty foam  a dark coral was rising  the blood  destroyed by the acid  was re creating itself  it was crazy  impossible 
      kris   i heard my name called  as though from a great distance   kris  the videophone  
      what  oh  thanks  
     the instrument had been buzzing for some time  but i had only just noticed it  i picked up the receiver   kelvin  
 snow  we are now all three plugged into the same circuit   the high pitched voice of sartorius came over the receiver   greetings  dr  kelvin   it was the wary tone of voice  full of false assurance  of the lecturer who knows he is on tenuous ground 
      good day to you  dr  sartorius   i wanted to laugh  but in the circumstances i hardly felt i could yield to a mood of hilarity  after all  which of us was the laughing stock  in my hand i held a test tube containing some blood  i shook it  the blood coagulated  had i been the victim of an illusion a moment ago  had i  perhaps  been mistaken 
      i should like to set forth  gentlemen  certain questions concerning the       the phantoms  
     i listened to sartorius  but my mind refused to take in his words  i was pondering the coagulated blood and shutting out this distracting voice 
      lets call them phi creatures   snow interjected 
      very well  agreed  
     a vertical line  bisecting the screen and barely perceptible  showed that i was linked by two channels  on either side of this line  i should have seen two images   snow and sartorius  but the light rimmed screen remained dark  both my interlocutors had covered the lenses of their sets 
      each of us has made various experiments   the nasal voice still held the same wariness  there was a pause 
      i suggest first of all that we pool such knowledge as we have acquired so far   sartorius went on   afterwards  i shall venture to communicate to you the conclusion that i  personally  have reached  if you would be so good as to begin  dr  kelvin              me  
     all of a sudden  i sensed rheya watching me  i put my hand on the table and rolled the test tube under the instrument racks  then i perched myself on a stool which i dragged up with my foot  i was about to decline to give an opinion when  to my surprise  i heard myself answer 
      right  a little talk  i havent done much  but i can tell you about it  a histological sample       certain reactions  micro reactions  i have the impression that        i did not know how to go on  suddenly i found my tongue and continued   everything looks normal  but its a camouflage  a cover  in a way  its a super copy  a reproduction which is superior to the original  ill explain what i mean  there exists  in man  an absolute limit   a term to structural divisibility   whereas here  the frontiers have been pushed back  we are dealing with a sub atomic structure  
      just a minute  just a minute  kindly be more precise   sartorius interrupted 
     snow said nothing  did i catch an echo of his rapid breathing  rheya was looking at me again  i realized that  in my excitement  i had almost shouted the last words  calmer  i settled myself on my uncomfortable perch and closed my eyes  how could i be more precise 
      the atom is the ultimate constituent element of our bodies  my guess is that the phibeings are constituted of units smaller than ordinary atoms  much smaller  
      mesons   put in sartorius  he did not sound in the least surprised 
      no  not mesons       i would have seen them  the power of this instrument here is between a 10th to a 20th of an angstrom  isnt it  but nothing is visible  nothing whatsoever  so it cant be mesons  more likely neutrinos  
      how do you account for that theory  conglomerations of neutrinos are unstable       
      i dont know  im not a physicist  perhaps a magnetic field could stabilize them  its not my province  in any event  if my observations are correct  the structure is made up of particles at least ten thousand times smaller than atoms  wait a minute  i havent finished  if the albuminous molecules and the cells were directly constructed from micro atoms  they would be proportionally even smaller  this applies to the corpuscles  the micro organisms  everything  now  the dimensions are those of atomic structures  consequently  the albumen  the cell and the nucleus of the cell are nothing but camouflage  the real structure  which determines the functions of the visitor  remains concealed  
      kelvin  
     snow had uttered a stifled cry  i stopped  horrified  i had said  visitor  
     rheya had not overheard  at any rate  she had not understood  her head in her hand  she was staring out of the window  her delicate profile etched against the purple dawn 
     my distant interlocutors were silent  i could hear their breathing 
      theres something in what he says   snow muttered 
      yes   remarked sartorius   but for one fact  kelvins hypothetical particles have nothing to do with the structure of the ocean  the ocean is composed of atoms  
      perhaps its capable of producing neutrinos   i replied 
     suddenly i was bored with all their talk  the conversation was pointless  and not even amusing 
      kelvins hypothesis explains this extraordinary resistance and the speed of regeneration   snow growled   they probably carry their own energy source as well  they dont need food       
      i believe i have the chair   sartorius interrupted  the self designated chairman of the debate was clinging exasperatingly to his role   i should like to raise the question of the motivation behind the appearance of the phi creatures  i put it to you as follows  what are the phi creatures  they are not autonomous individuals  nor copies of actual persons  they are merely projections materializing from our brains  based on a given individual  
     i was struck by the soundness of this description  sartorius might not be very sympathetic  but he was certainly no fool 
     i rejoined the conversation 
      i think youre right  your definition explains why a particular per       creation appears rather than another  the origin of the materialization lies in the most durable imprints of memory  those which are especially well defined  but no single imprint can be completely isolated  and in the course of the reproduction  fragments of related imprints are absorbed  thus the new arrival sometimes reveals a more extensive knowledge than that of the individual of whom it is a copy       
      kelvin   shouted snow once more 
     it was only snow who reacted to my lapses  sartorius did not seem to be affected by them  did this mean that sartoriuss visitor was less perspicacious than snows  for a moment  i imagined the scholarly sartorius cohabiting with a cretinous dwarf 
      indeed  that corresponds with our observations   sartorius said   now  let us consider the motivation behind the apparition  it is natural enough to assume  in the first instance  that we are the object of an experiment  when i examine this proposition  the experiment seems to me badly designed  when we carry out an experiment  we profit by the results and  above all  we carefully note the defects of our methods  as a result  we introduce modifications in our future procedure  but  in the case with which we are concerned  not a single modification has occurred  the phi creatures reappear exactly as they were  down to the last detail       as vulnerable as before  each time we attempt to       to rid ourselves of them       
      exactly   i broke in   a recoil  with no compensating mechanism  as dr  snow would say  conclusions  
      simply that the thesis of experimentation is inconsistent with this       this unbelievable bungling  the ocean is       precise  the dual level structure of the phicreatures testifies to this precision  within the prescribed limits  the phi creatures behave in the same way as the real       the       er       
     he could not disentangle himself 
      the originals   said snow  in a loud whisper 
      yes  the originals  but when the situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of       er       the original  the phi creature suffers a sort of disconnection of consciousness  followed immediately by unusual  non human manifestations       
      its true   i said   and we can amuse ourselves drawing up a catalogue of the behavior of       of these creatures   a totally frivolous occupation  
      im not sure of that   protested sartorius  i suddenly realized why he irritated me so much  he didnt talk  he lectured  as though he were in the chair at the institute  he seemed to be incapable of expressing himself in any other way   here we come to the question of individuality   he went on   of which  i am quite sure  the ocean has not the smallest inkling  i think that the       er       delicate or shocking aspect of our present situation is completely beyond its comprehension  
      you think its activities are unpremeditated  
     i was somewhat bewildered by sartoriuss point of view  but on second thought  i realized that it could not be dismissed 
      no  unlike our colleague snow  i dont believe there is malice  or deliberate cruelty   
    
     snow broke in 
      im not suggesting it has human feelings  im merely trying to find an explanation for these continual reappearances  
     with a secret desire to nag poor sartorius  i said 
      perhaps they are plugged into a contrivance which goes round and round  endlessly repeating itself  like a gramophone record       
      gentlemen  i beg you  let us not waste time   i havent yet finished  in normal circumstances  i would have felt it premature to present a report  even a provisional one  on the progress of my research  in view of the prevailing situation  however  i think i may allow myself to speak out  i have the impression   only an impression  mark you   that dr  kelvins hypothesis is not without validity  i am alluding to the hypothesis of a neutrino structure       our knowledge in this field is purely theoretical  we did not know if there was any possibility of stabilizing such structures  now a clearly defined solution offers itself to us  a means of neutralizing the magnetic field that maintains the stability of the structure       
     a few moments previously  i had noticed that the screen was flickering with light  now a split appeared from top to bottom of the left hand side  i saw something pink move slowly out of view  then the lens cover slipped again  disclosing the screen 
     sartorius gave an anguished cry 
      go away  go away  
     i saw his hands flapping and struggling  then his forearms  covered by the wide sleeves of the laboratory gown  a bright golden disc shone out for an instant  then everything went dark  only then did i realize that this golden disc was a straw hat      
     i took a deep breath 
      snow  
     an exhausted voice replied 
      yes  kelvin        hearing his voice  i realized that i had become quite fond of him  and that i preferred not to know who or what his companion was   thats enough for now  dont you think   he said 
      i agree   before he could cut off  i added quickly   listen  if you can  come and see me  either in the operating room or in my cabin  
      ok  but i dont know when  
     the conference was over
