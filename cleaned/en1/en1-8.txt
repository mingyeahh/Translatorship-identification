 i woke up in the middle of the night to find the light on and rheya crouched at the end of the bed  wrapped in a sheet  her shoulders shaking with silent tears  i called her name and asked her what was wrong  but she only curled up tighter 
     still half asleep  and barely emerged from the nightmare which had been tormenting me only a moment before  i pulled myself up to a sitting position and shielded my eyes against the glare to look at her  the trembling continued  and i stretched out my arms  but rheya pushed me away and hid her face 
      rheya       
      dont talk to me  
      rheya  whats the matter  
     i caught a glimpse of her tear stained face  contorted with emotion  the big childish tears streamed down her face  glistened in the dimple above her chin and fell onto the sheets 
      you dont want me  
      what are you talking about  
      i heard       
     my jaw tightened   heard what  you dont understand  
      yes i do  you said i wasnt rheya  you wanted me to go  and i would  i really would       but i cant  i dont know why  ive tried to go  but i couldnt do it  im such a coward  
      come on now          i put my arms round her and held her with all my strength  nothing mattered to me except her  everything else was meaningless  i kissed her hands  talked  begged  excused myself and made promise after promise  saying that she had been having some silly  terrible dream  gradually she grew calmer  and at last she stopped crying and her eyes glazed  like a woman walking in her sleep  she turned her face away from me 
      no   she said at last   be quiet  dont talk like that  its no good  youre not the same person any more   i started to protest  but she went on   no  you dont want me  i knew it before  but i pretended not to notice  i thought perhaps i was imagining everything  but it was true       youve changed  youre not being honest with me  you talk about dreams  but it was you who were dreaming  and it was to do with me  you spoke my name as if it repelled you  why  just tell me why  
      rheya  my little         
      i wont have you talking to me like that  do you hear  i wont let you  im not your little anything  im not a child  im         
     she burst into tears and buried her face in the pillow  i got up  the ventilation hummed quietly  it was cold  and i pulled a dressing gown over my shoulders before sitting next to her and taking her arm   listen to me  im going to tell you something  im going to tell you the truth  
     she pushed herself upright again  i could see the veins throbbing beneath the delicate skin of her neck  my jaw tightened once more  the air seemed to be colder still  and my head was completely empty 
      the truth   she said   word of honor   i opened my mouth to speak  but no sound came  word of honor       it was our special catch phrase  our old way of making an unconditional promise  once these words had been spoken  neither of us was permitted to lie  or even to take refuge behind a half truth  i remembered the period when we used to torture each other in an exaggerated striving for sincerity  convinced that this ingenuous honesty was the precondition of our relationship 
      word of honor  rheya   i answered gravely  and she waited for me to continue   you have changed too   we all change  but that is not what i wanted to say  for some reason that neither of us understands  it seems that       you are forced to stay near me  and thats fine with me  because i cant leave you either       
      no  kris  the change is not in you   rheya whispered   its me  something is wrong  perhaps it has to do with the accident  
     she looked at the dark  empty rectangle of the door  the previous evening  i had removed the shattered remains   a new one would have to be fitted  another thought struck me 
      have you been managing to sleep  
      i dont know  
      what do you mean  
      i have dreams       i dont know whether they really are dreams  perhaps im ill  i lie there and think  and       
      what  
      i have strange thoughts  i dont know where they come from  
     it took all my self control to steady my voice and tell her to go on  and i found myself tensing for her answer as if for a blow in the face 
      they are thoughts        she shook her head helplessly         all around me  
      i dont understand  
      i get a feeling as if they were not from inside myself  but somewhere further away  i cant explain it  cant put words to it       
     i broke in almost involuntarily   it must be some kind of dream   then  back in control again   and now  we put the light out and we forget our problems until morning  tomorrow we can invent some new ones if you like  ok  
     she pressed the switch  and darkness fell between us  stretched out on the bed  i felt her warm breathing beside me  and put my arms round her 
      harder   she whispered  and then  after a long pause 
      kris  
      what  
      i love you  
     i almost screamed 
     in the red morning  the suns swollen disc was rising over the horizon 
     an envelope lay in the doorway  and i tore it open  i could hear rheya humming to herself in the bath  and from time to time she looked into the room and i would see her face  half hidden by her wet hair 
     i went to the window  and read 
  
       kelvin  things are looking up  sartorius has decided that it may be possible to use some form of energy to destabilize the neutrino structure  he wants to examine some phi plasma in orbit  he suggests that you make a reconnaissance flight and take a certain quantity of plasma in the capsule  its up to you  but let me know what you decide  i have no opinion  i feel as if i no longer have anything  if i am more in favor of your going  its because we would at least be making some show of progress  otherwise  we can only envy g 
     snow
     p s  all i ask is for you to stay outside the cabin  you can call me on the videophone   
  
     i felt a stir of apprehension as i read the letter  and went over it again carefully before tearing it up and throwing the pieces into the disposal unit 
     i went through the same terrible charade that i had begun the previous day  and made up a story for rheyas benefit  she did not notice the deception  and when i told her that i had to make an inspection and suggested that she come with me she was delighted  we stopped at the kitchen for breakfast   rheya ate very little   and then made for the library 
     before venturing on the mission suggested by sartorius  i wanted to glance through the literature dealing with magnetic fields and neutrino structures  i did not yet have any clear idea of how i would set about it  but i had made up my mind to make an independent check on sartoriuss activities  not that i would prevent snow and sartorius from liberating themselves when the annihilator was completed  i meant to take rheya out of the station and wait for the conclusion of the operation in the cabin of an aircraft  i set to work with the automatic librarian  sometimes it answered my queries by ejecting a card with the laconic inscription  not on file   sometimes it practically submerged me under such a spate of specialist physics textbooks that i hesitated to use its advice  yet i had no desire to leave the big circular chamber  i felt at ease in my egg  among the rows of cabinets crammed with tape and microfilm  situated right at the center of the station  the library had no windows  it was the most isolated area in the great steel shell  and made me feel relaxed in spite of finding my researches held up 
     wandering across the vast room  i stopped at a set of shelves as high as the ceiling  and holding about six hundred volumes   all classics on the history of solaris  starting with the nine volumes of gieses monumental and already relatively obsolescent monograph  display for its own sake was improbable in these surroundings  the collection was a respectful tribute to the memory of the pioneers  i took down the massive volumes of giese and sat leafing through them  rheya had also located some reading matter  looking over her shoulder  i saw that she had picked one of the many books brought out by the first expedition  the  interplanetary cookery book   which could have been the personal property of giese himself  she was poring over the recipes adapted to the arduous conditions of interstellar flight  i said nothing  and returned to the book resting on my knees   solaris   ten years of exploration  had appeared as volumes 4 12 of the solariana collection whose most recent additions were numbered in the thousands 
     giese was an unemotional man  but then in the study of solaris emotion is a hindrance to the explorer  imagination and premature theorizing are positive disadvantages in approaching a planet where   as has become clear   anything is possible  it is almost certain that the unlikely descriptions of the plasmatic metamorphoses of the ocean are faithful accounts of the phenomena observed  although these descriptions are unverifiable  since the ocean seldom repeats itself  the freakish character and gigantic scale of these phenomena go too far outside the experience of man to be grasped by anybody observing them for the first time  and who would consider analogous occurrences as sports of nature  accidental manifestations of blind forces  if he saw them on a reduced scale  say in a mud volcano on earth 
     genius and mediocrity alike are dumbfounded by the teeming diversity of the oceanic formations of solaris  no man has ever become genuinely conversant with them  giese was by no means a mediocrity  nor was he a genius  he was a scholarly classifier  the type whose compulsive application to their work utterly divorces them from the pressures of everyday life  giese devised a plain descriptive terminology  supplemented by terms of his own invention  and although these were inadequate  and sometimes clumsy  it has to be admitted that no semantic system is as yet available to illustrate the behavior of the ocean  the tree mountains  extensors  fungoids  mimoids  symmetriads and asymmetriads  vertebrids and agilus are artificial  linguistically awkward terms  but they do give some impression of solaris to anyone who has only seen the planet in blurred photographs and incomplete films  the fact is that in spite of his cautious nature the scrupulous giese more than once jumped to premature conclusions  even when on their guard  human beings inevitably theorize  giese  who thought himself immune to temptation  decided that the extensors came into the category of basic forms  he compared them to accumulations of gigantic waves  similar to the tidal movements of our terran oceans  in the first edition of his work  we find them originally named as tides  this geocentrism might be considered amusing if it did not underline the dilemma in which he found himself 
     as soon as the question of comparisons with earth arises  it must be understood that the extensors are formations that dwarf the grand canyon  that they are produced in a substance which externally resembles a yeasty colloid  during this fantastic fermentation  the yeast sets into festoons of starched open work lace  some experts refer to ossified tumors   and that deeper down the substance becomes increasingly resistant  like a tensed muscle which fifty feet below the surface is as hard as rock but retains its flexibility  the extensor appears to be an independent creation  stretching for miles between membranous walls swollen with ossified growths  like some colossal python which after swallowing a mountain is sluggishly digesting the meal  while a slow shudder occasionally ripples along its creeping body  the extensor only looks like a lethargic reptile from overhead  at close quarters  when the two canyon walls loom hundreds of yards above the exploring aircraft  it can be seen that this inflated cylinder  reaching from one side of the horizon to the other  is bewilderingly alive with movement  first you notice the continual rotating motion of a greyish green  oily sludge which reflects blinding sunlight  but skimming just above the back of the python  the ravine sheltering the extensor now resembles the sides of a geological fault   you realize that the motion is in fact far more complex  and consists of concentric fluctuations traversed by darker currents  occasionally this mantle turns into a shining crust that reflects sky and clouds and then is riddled by explosive eruptions of the internal gases and fluids  the observer slowly realizes that he is looking at the guiding forces that are thrusting outward and upward the two gradually crystallizing gelatinous walls  science does not accept the obvious without further proof  however  and virulent controversies have reverberated down the years on the key question of the exact sequence of events in the interior of the extensors that furrow the vast living ocean in their millions 
     various organic functions have been ascribed to the extensors  some experts have argued that their purpose is the transformation of matter  others suggested respiratory processes  still others claimed that they conveyed alimentary materials  an infinite variety of hypotheses now moulder in library basements  eliminated by ingenious  sometimes dangerous experiments  today  the scientists will go no further than to refer to the extensors as relatively simple  stable formations whose duration is measurable in weeks   an exceptional characteristic among the recorded phenomena of the planet 
     the mimoid formations are considerably more complex and bizarre  and elicit a more vehement response from the observer  an instinctive response  i mean  it can be stated without exaggeration that giese fell in love with the mimoids and was soon devoting all his time to them  for the rest of his life  he studied and described them and brought all his ingenuity to bear on defining their nature  the name he gave them indicates their most astonishing characteristic  the imitation of objects  near or far  external to the ocean itself 
     concealed at first beneath the ocean surface  a large flattened disc appears  ragged  with a tar like coating  after a few hours  it begins to separate into flat sheets which rise slowly  the observer now becomes a spectator at what looks like a fight to the death  as massed ranks of waves converge from all directions like contorted  fleshy mouths which snap greedily around the tattered  fluttering leaf  then plunge into the depths  as each ring of waves breaks and sinks  the fall of this mass of hundreds of thousands of tons is accompanied for an instant by a viscous rumbling  an immense thunderclap  the tarry leaf is overwhelmed  battered and torn apart  with every fresh assault  circular fragments scatter and drift like feebly fluttering wings below the ocean surface  they bunch into pear shaped clusters or long strings  merge and rise again  and drag with them an undertow of coagulated shreds of the base of the primal disc  the encircling waves continue to break around the steadily expanding crater  this phenomenon may persist for a day or linger on for a month  and sometimes there are no further developments  the conscientious giese dubbed this first variation a stillbirth  convinced that each of these upheavals aspired towards an ultimate condition  the major mimoid  like a polyp colony  only covering an area greater than a town  of pale outcroppings with the faculty of imitating foreign bodies  uyvens  on the other hand  saw this final stage as constituting a degeneration or necrosis  according to him  the appearance of the copies corresponded to a localized dissipation of the life energies of the ocean  which was no longer in control of the original forms it created 
     giese would not abandon his account of the various phases of the process as a sustained progression towards perfection  with a conviction which is particularly surprising coming from a man of such a moderate  cautious turn of mind in advancing the most trivial hypothesis on the other creations of the ocean  normally he had all the boldness of an ant crawling up a glacier 
     viewed from above  the mimoid resembles a town  an illusion produced by our compulsion to superimpose analogies with what we know  when the sky is clear  a shimmering heat haze covers the pliant structures of the clustered polyps surmounted by membranous palisades  the first cloud passing overhead wakens the mimoid  all the outcrops suddenly sprout new shoots  then the mass of polyps ejects a thick tegument which dilates  puffs out  changes color and in the space of a few minutes has produced an astonishing imitation of the volutes of a cloud  the enormous object casts a reddish shadow over the mimoid  whose peaks ripple and bend together  always in the opposite direction to the movement of the real cloud  i imagine that giese would have been ready to give his right hand to discover what made the mimoids behave in this way  but these isolated productions are nothing in comparison to the frantic activity the mimoid displays when stimulated by objects of human origin 
     the reproduction process embraces every object inside a radius of eight or nine miles  usually the facsimile is an enlargement of the original  whose forms are sometimes only roughly copied  the reproduction of machines  in particular  elicits simplifications that might be considered grotesque   practically caricatures  the copy is always modelled in the same colorless tegument  which hovers above the outcrops  linked to its base by flimsy umbilical cords  it slides  creeps  curls back on itself  shrinks or swells and finally assumes the most complicated forms  an aircraft  a net or a pole are all reproduced at the same speed  the mimoid is not stimulated by human beings themselves  and in fact it does not react to any living matter  and has never copied  for example  the plants imported for experimental purposes  on the other hand  it will readily reproduce a puppet or a doll  a carving of a dog  or a tree sculpted in any material 
     the observer must bear in mind that the obedience of the mimoid does not constitute evidence of cooperation  since it is not consistent  the most highly evolved mimoid has its off days  when it lives in slow motion  or its pulsation weakens   this pulsation is invisible to the naked eye  and was only discovered after close examination of rapidmotion film of the mimoid  which revealed that each beat took two hours  
     during these off days  it is easy to explore the mimoid  especially if it is old  for the base anchored in the ocean  like the protuberances growing out of it  is relatively solid  and provides a firm footing for a man  it is equally possible to remain inside the mimoid during periods of activity  except that visibility is close to nil because of the whitish colloidal dust continually emitted through tears in the tegument above  in any case  at close range it is impossible to distinguish what forms the tegument is assuming  on account of their vast size   the smallest copy is the size of a mountain  in addition  a thick layer of colloidal snow quickly covers the base of the mimoid  this spongy carpet takes several hours to solidify  the frozen crust will take the weight of a man  though its composition is much lighter than pumice stone   the problem is that without special equipment there is a risk of being lost in the maze of tangled structures and crevasses  sometimes reminiscent of jumbled colonnades  sometimes of petrified geysers  even in daylight it is easy to lose ones direction  for the suns rays cannot pierce the white ceiling ejected into the atmosphere by the imitative explosions 
     on gala days  for the scientist as well as for the mimoid   an unforgettable spectacle develops as the mimoid goes into hyperproduction and performs wild flights of fancy  it plays variations on the theme of a given object and embroiders formal extensions that amuse it for hours on end  to the delight of the non figurative artist and the despair of the scientist  who is at a loss to grasp any common theme in the performance  the mimoid can produce primitive simplifications  but is just as likely to indulge in baroque deviations  paroxysms of extravagant brilliance  old mimoids tend to manufacture extremely comic forms  looking at the photographs  i have never been moved to laughter  the riddle they set is too disquieting to be funny 
     during the early years of exploration  the scientists literally threw themselves upon the mimoids  which were spoken of as open windows on the ocean and the best opportunity to establish the hoped for contact between the two civilizations  they were soon forced to admit that there was not the slightest prospect of communication  and that the entire process began and ended with the reproduction of forms  the mimoids were a dead end 
     giving way to the temptations of a latent anthropomorphism or zoomorphism  there were many schools of thought which saw various other oceanic formations as sensory organs  even as limbs  which was how experts like maartens and ekkonai classified gieses vertebrids and agilus for a time  anyone who is rash enough to see protuberances that reach as far as two miles into the atmosphere as limbs  might just as well claim that earthquakes are the gymnastics of the earths crust 
     three hundred chapters of giese catalogue the standard formations which occur on the surface of the living ocean and which can be seen in dozens  even hundreds  in the course of any day  the symmetriads   to continue using the terminology and definitions of the giese school   are the least human formations  which is to say that they bear no resemblance whatsoever to anything on earth  by the time  the symmetriads were being investigated  it was already clear that the ocean was not aggressive  and that its plasmatic eddies would not swallow any but the most foolhardy explorer  of course i am not including accidents resulting from mechanical failures   it is possible to fly in complete safety from one part to another of the cylindrical body of an extensor  or of the vertebrids  jacobs ladders oscillating among the clouds  the plasma retreats at the speed of sound in the planets atmosphere to make way for any foreign body  deep funnels will open even beneath the surface of the ocean  at a prodigious expenditure of energy  calculated by scriabin at around 10 19 ergs   nevertheless the first venture into the interior of a symmetriad was undertaken with the utmost caution and discipline  and involved a host of what turned out to be unnecessary safety measures  every schoolboy on earth knows of these pioneers 
     it is not their nightmare appearance that makes the gigantic symmetriad formations dangerous  but the total instability and capriciousness of their structure  in which even the laws of physics do not hold  the theory that the living ocean is endowed with intelligence has found its firmest adherents among those scientists who have ventured into their unpredictable depths 
     the birth of a symmetriad comes like a sudden eruption  about an hour beforehand  an area of tens of square miles of ocean vitrifies and begins to shine  it remains fluid  and there is no alteration in the rhythm of the waves  occasionally the phenomenon of vitrification occurs in the neighbourhood of the funnel left by an agilus  the gleaming sheath of the ocean heaves upwards to form a vast ball that reflects sky  sun  clouds and the entire horizon in a medley of changing  variegated images  diffracted light creates a kaleidoscopic play of color 
     the effects of light on a symmetriad are especially striking during the blue day and the red sunset  the planet appears to be giving birth to a twin that increases in volume from one moment to the next  the immense flaming globe has scarcely reached its maximum expansion above the ocean when it bursts at the summit and cracks vertically  it is not breaking up  this is the second phase  which goes under the clumsy name of the floral calyx phase and lasts only a few seconds  the membranous arches soaring into the sky now fold inwards and merge to produce a thick set trunk enclosing a scene of teeming activity  at the center of the trunk  which was explored for the first time by the seventy man hamalei expedition  a process of polycrystallization on a giant scale erects an axis commonly referred to as the backbone  a term which i consider illchosen  the mind bending architecture of this central pillar is held in place by vertical shafts of a gelatinous  almost liquid consistency  constantly gushing upwards out of wide crevasses  meanwhile  the entire trunk is surrounded by a belt of snow foam  seething with great bubbles of gas  and the whole process is accompanied by a perpetual dull roar of sound  from the center towards the periphery  powerful buttresses spin out and are coated with streams of ductile matter rising out of the ocean depths simultaneously the gelatinous geysers are converted into mobile columns that proceed to extrude tendrils that reach out in clusters towards points rigorously predetermined by the over all dynamics of the entire structure  they call to mind the gills of an embryo  except that they are revolving at fantastic speed and ooze trickles of pinkish blood and a dark green secretion 
     the symmetriad now begins to display its most exotic characteristic   the property of illustrating  sometimes contradicting  various laws of physics   bear in mind that no two symmetriads are alike  and that the geometry of each one is a unique invention of the living ocean   the interior of the symmetriad becomes a factory for the production of monumental machines  as these constructs are sometimes called  although they resemble no machine which it is within the power of mankind to build  the designation is applied because all this activity has finite ends  and is therefore in some sense mechanical 
     when the geysers of oceanic matter have solidified into pillars or into threedimensional networks of galleries and passages  and the membranes are set into an inextricable pattern of storeys  panels and vaults  the symmetriad justifies its name  for the entire structure is divided into two segments  each mirroring the other to the most infinitesimal detail 
     after twenty or thirty minutes  when the axis may have tilted as much as eight to ten degrees from the horizontal  the giant begins slowly to subside   symmetriads vary in size  but as the base begins to submerge even the smallest reach a height of half a mile  and are visible from miles away   at last  the structure stabilizes itself  and the partly submerged symmetriad ceases its activity  it is now possible to explore it in complete safety by making an entry near the summit  through one of the many syphons which emerge from the dome  the completed symmetriad represents a spatial analogue of some transcendental equation 
     it is a commonplace that any equation can be expressed in the figurative language of non euclidean geometry and represented in three dimensions  this interpretation relates the symmetriad to lobachevskys cones and riemanns negative curves  although its unimaginable complexity makes the relationship highly tenuous  the eventual form occupies an area of several cubic miles and extends far beyond our whole system of mathematics  in addition  this extension is four dimensional  for the fundamental terms of the equations use a temporal symbolism expressed in the internal changes over a given period 
     it would be only natural  clearly  to suppose that the symmetriad is a computer of the living ocean  performing calculations for a purpose that we are not able to grasp  this was fremonts theory  now generally discounted  the hypothesis was a tempting one  but it proved impossible to sustain the concept that the living ocean examined problems of matter  the cosmos and existence through the medium of titanic eruptions  in which every particle had an indispensable function as a controlled element in an analytical system of infinite purity  in fact  numerous phenomena contradict this over simplified  some say childishly naive  concept 
     any number of attempts have been made to transpose and illustrate the symmetriad  and averians demonstration was particularly well received  let us imagine  he said  an edifice dating from the great days of babylon  but built of some living  sensitive substance with the capacity to evolve  the architectonics of this edifice pass through a series of phases  and we see it adopt the forms of a greek  then of a roman building  the columns sprout like branches and become narrower  the roof grows lighter  rises  curves  the arch describes an abrupt parabola then breaks down into an arrow shape  the gothic is born  comes to maturity and gives way in time to new forms  austerity of line gives way to a riot of exploding lines and shapes  and the baroque runs wild  if the progression continues   and the successive mutations are to be seen as stages in the life of an evolving organism   we finally arrive at the architecture of the space age  and perhaps too at some understanding of the symmetriad 
     unfortunately  no matter how this demonstration may be expanded and unproved  there have been attempts to visualize it with the aid of models and films   the comparison remains superficial  it is evasive and illusory  and side steps the central fact that the symmetriad is quite unlike anything earth has ever produced 
     the human mind is only capable of absorbing a few things at a time  we see what is taking place in front of us in the here and now  and cannot envisage simultaneously a succession of processes  no matter how integrated and complementary  our faculties of perception are consequently limited even as regards fairly simple phenomena  the fate of a single man can be rich with significance  that of a few hundred less so  but the history of thousands and millions of men does not mean anything at all  in any adequate sense of the word   the symmetriad is a million   a billion  rather   raised to the power of  n   it is incomprehensible  we pass through vast halls  each with a capacity of ten kronecker units  and creep like so many ants clinging to the folds of breathing vaults and craning to watch the flight of soaring girders  opalescent in the glare of searchlights  and elastic domes which criss cross and balance each other unerringly  the perfection of a moment  since everything here passes and fades  the essence of this architecture is movement synchronized towards a precise objective  we observe a fraction of the process  like hearing the vibration of a single string in an orchestra of supergiants  we know  but cannot grasp  that above and below  beyond the limits of perception or imagination  thousands and millions of simultaneous transformations are at work  interlinked like a musical score by mathematical counterpoint  it has been described as a symphony in geometry  but we lack the ears to hear it 
     only a long distance view would reveal the entire process  but the outer covering of the symmetriad conceals the colossal inner matrix where creation is unceasing  the created becomes the creator  and absolutely identical twins are born at opposite poles  separated by towering structures and miles of distance  the symphony creates itself  and writes its own conclusion  which is terrible to watch  every observer feels like a spectator at a tragedy or a public massacre  when after two or three hours   never longer   the living ocean stages its assault  the polished surface of the ocean swirls and crumples  the desiccated foam liquefies again  begins to seethe  and legions of waves pour inwards from every point of the horizon  their gaping mouths far more massive than the greedy lips that surround the embryonic mimoid  the submerged base of the symmetriad is compressed  and the colossus rises as if on the point of being shot out of the planets gravitational pull  the upper layers of the ocean redouble their activity  and the waves surge higher and higher to lick against the sides of the symmetriad  they envelop it  harden and plug the orifices  but their attack is nothing compared to the scene in the interior  first the process of creation freezes momentarily  then there is panic  the smooth interpenetration of moving forms and the harmonious play of planes and lines accelerates  and the impression is inescapable that the symmetriad is hurrying to complete some task in the face of danger  the awe inspired by the metamorphosis and dynamics of the symmetriad intensifies as the proud sweep of the domes falters  vaults sag and droop  and wrong notes   incomplete  mangled forms   make their appearance  a powerful moaning roar issues from the invisible depths like a sigh of agony  reverberates through the narrow funnels and booms through the collapsing domes  in spite of the growing destructive violence of these convulsions  the spectator is rooted to the spot  only the force of the hurricane streaing out of the depths and howling through the thousands of galleries keeps the great structure erect  soon it subsides and starts to disintegrate  there are final flutterings  contortions  and blind  random spasms  gnawed and undermined  the giant sinks slowly and disappears  and the space where it stood is covered with whirlpools of foam 
     so what does all this mean 
     i remembered an incident dating from my spell as assistant to gibarian  a group of schoolchildren visiting the solarist institute in aden were making their way through the main hall of the library and looking at the racks of microfilm that occupied the entire left hand side of the hall  the guide explained that among other phenomena immortalized by the image  these contained fragmentary glimpses of symmetriads long since vanished   not single shots  but whole reels  more than ninety thousand of them 
     one plump schoolgirl  she looked about fifteen  peering inquisitively over her spectacles  abruptly asked   and what is it for  
     in the ensuing embarrassed silence  the school mistress was content to dart a reproving look at her wayward pupil  among the solarists whose job was to act as guides  i was one of them   no one would produce an answer  each symmetriad is unique  and the developments in its heart are  generally speaking  unpredictable  sometimes there is no sound  sometimes the index of refraction increases or diminishes  sometimes  rhythmic pulsations are accompanied by local changes in gravitation  as if the heart of the symmetriad were beating by gravitating  sometimes the compasses of the observers spin wildly  and ionized layers spring up and disappear  the catalogue could go on indefinitely  in any case  even if we did ever succeed in solving the riddle of the symmetriads  we would still have to contend with the asymmetriads 
     the asymmetriads are born in the same manner as the symmetriads but finish differently  and nothing can be seen of their internal processes except tremors  vibrations and flickering  we do know  however  that the interior houses bewildering operations performed at a speed that defies the laws of physics and which are dubbed giant quantic phenomena  the mathematical analogy with certain three dimensional models of the atom is so unstable and transitory that some commentators dismiss the resemblance as of secondary importance  if not purely accidental  the asymmetriads have a very short lifespan of fifteen to twenty minutes  and their death is even more appalling than that of the symmetriads  with the howling gale that screams through its fabric  a thick fluid gushes out  gurgles hideously  and submerges everything beneath a foul  bubbling foam  then an explosion  coinciding with a muddy eruption  hurls up a spout of debris which rains slowly down into the seething ocean  this debris is sometimes found scores of miles from the focus of the explosion  dried up  yellow and flattened  like flakes of cartilage 
     some other creations of the ocean  which are much more rare and of very variable duration  part company with the parent body entirely  the first traces of these independents were identified   wrongly  it was later proved   as the remains of creatures inhabiting the ocean deeps  the free ranging forms are often reminiscent of many winged birds  darting away from the moving trunks of the agilus  but the preconceptions of earth offer no assistance in unravelling the mysteries of 
solaris  strange  seal like bodies appear now and then on the rocky outcrop of an island  sprawling in the sun or dragging themselves lazily back to merge with the ocean 
     there was no escaping the impressions that grew out of mans experience on earth  the prospects of contact receded 
     explorers travelled hundreds of miles in the depths of symmetriads  and installed measuring instruments and remote control cameras  artificial satellites captured the birth of mimoids and extensors  and faithfully reproduced their images of growth and destruction  the libraries overflowed  the archives grew  and the price paid for all this documentation was often very heavy  one notorious disaster cost one hundred and six people their lives  among them giese himself  while studying what was undoubtedly a symmetriad  the expedition was suddenly destroyed by a process peculiar to the asymmetriads  in two seconds  an eruption of glutinous mud swallowed up seventy nine men and all their equipment  another twenty seven observers surveying the area from aircraft and helicopters were also caught in the eruption 
     following the eruption of the hundred and six  and for the first time in solarist studies  there were petitions demanding a thermo nuclear attack on the ocean  such a response would have been more cruelty than revenge  since it would have meant destroying what we did not understand  tsankens ultimatum  which was never offically acknowledged  probably influenced the negative outcome of the vote  he was in command of gieses reserve team  and had survived owing to a transmission error that took him off his course  to arrive in the disaster area a few minutes after the explosion  when the black mushroom cloud was still visible  informed of the proposal for a nuclear strike  he threatened to blow up the station  together with the nineteen survivors sheltering inside it
     today  there are only three of us on the station  its construction was controlled by satellites  and was a technical feat on which the human race has a right to pride itself  even if the ocean builds far more impressive structures in the space of a few seconds  the station is a disc of one hundred yards radius  and contains four decks at the center and two at the circumference  it is maintained at a height of from five to fifteen hundred yards above the ocean by gravitors programmed to compensate for the oceans own field of attraction  in addition to all the machines available to ordinary stations and the large artificial satellites that orbit other planets  the solaris station is equipped with specialized radar apparatus sensitive to the smallest fluctuations of the ocean surface  which trips auxiliary power circuits capable of thrusting the steel disc into the stratosphere at the first indication of new plasmatic upheavals 
     but today  in spite of the presence of our faithful visitors  the station was strangely deserted  ever since the robots had been locked away in the lower deck store rooms   for a reason i had still not discovered   it had been possible to walk around without meeting a single member of the crew of our ghost ship 
     as i replaced the ninth volume of giese on the shelf  the plastic coated steel floor seemed to shudder under my feet  i stood still  but the vibration had stopped  the library was completely isolated from the other rooms  and the only possible source of vibration must be a shuttle leaving the station  this thought jerked me back to reality  i had not yet decided to accept sartoriuss suggestion and leave the station  by feigning approval of his plan  i had been more or less postponing the outbreak of hostilities  for i was determined to save rheya  all the same  sartorius might have some chance of success  he certainly had the advantage of being a qualified physicist  while i was in the ironic position of having to count on the superiority of the ocean  i pored over microfilm texts for an hour  and made myself wrestle with the unfamiliar language of neutrino physics  the undertaking seemed hopeless at first  there were no less than five current theories dealing with neutrino fields  an obvious indication that none was definitive  eventually i struck promising ground  and was busily copying down equations when there was a knock at the door  i got up quickly and opened it a few inches  to see snows perspiring face  and behind him an empty corridor 
      yes  its me   his voice was hoarse  and there were dark pouches under the bloodshot eyes  he wore an antiradiation apron of shiny rubber  and the same worn old trousers held up by elastic braces 
     snows gaze flickered round the circular chamber and alighted on rheya where she stood by an armchair at the other end  then it returned to me  and i lowered my eyelids imperceptibly  he nodded  and i spoke casually 
      rheya  come and meet dr  snow       snow   my wife  
      i       im just a minor member of the crew  dont get about much        he faltered  but managed to blurt out   thats why i havent had the pleasure of meeting you before       
     rheya smiled and held out her hand  which he shook in some surprise  he blinked several times and stood looking at her  tongue tied  until i took him by the arm 
      excuse me   he said to rheya   i wanted a word with you  kelvin       
      of course    my composure was an ugly charade  but what else could i do    take no notice of us  rheya  well be talking shop       
     i guided snow over to the chairs on the far side of the room  and rheya sat in the armchair i had occupied earlier  swivelling it so that she could glance up at us from her book  i lowered my voice 
      any news  
      im divorced   he whispered  if anybody had quoted this to me as the opening of a conversation a few days before  i would have burst out laughing  but the station had blunted my sense of humor   it feels like years since yesterday morning   he went on   and you  
      nothing   i was at a loss for words  i liked snow  but i distrusted him  or rather i distrusted the purpose of his visit 
      nothing  surely       
      what   i pretended not to understand 
     eyes half shut  he leaned so close to me that i could feel his breath on my face 
     this business has all of us confused  kelvin  i cant make contact with sartorius  all i know is what i wrote to you  which is what he told me after our little conference      
      has he disconnected his videophone  
      no  theres been a short circuit at his end  he could have done it on purpose  but theres also        he clenched his fist and mimed somebody aiming a punch  curling his lips in an unpleasant grin   kelvin  i came here to       what do you intend doing  
      you want my answer to your letter  all right  ill go on the trip  theres no reason for me to refuse  ive only been getting ready        
      no   he interrupted   it isnt that  
      what then  go on  
      sartorius thinks he may be on the right track   snow muttered  his eyes never left me  and i had to stay still and try to look casual   it all started with that x ray experiment that he and gibarian arranged  you remember  that could have produced some alteration       
      what kind of alteration  
      they beamed the rays directly into the ocean  the intensity was only modulated according to a pre set program  
      i know  its already been done by nilin and a lot of others  
      yes  but the others worked on low power  this time they used everything we had  
      that could lead to trouble       violating the four power convention  and the united nations       
      come on  kelvin  you know as well as i do that it doesnt matter now  gibarian is dead  
      so sartorius makes him the scapegoat  
      i dont know  we havent talked about that  sartorius is intrigued by the visiting hours  they only come as we wake up  which suggests that the ocean is especially interested in our sleeping hours  and that that is when it locates its patterns  sartorius wants to send our waking selves   our conscious thoughts  you see  
      by mail  
      keep the jokes to yourself  the idea is to modulate the x rays by hooking in an electro encephalograph taken from one of us  
      ah   light was beginning to dawn   and that one of us is me  
      yes  sartorius had you in mind  
      tell him im flattered  
      will you do it  
     i hesitated  snow darted a look at rheya  who seemed absorbed in her book  i felt my face turn pale 
      well  
      the idea of using x rays to preach sermons on the greatness of mankind seems absolutely ridiculous to me  dont you think so   
      you mean it   
      yes  
      right   he said  smiling as if i had fallen in with some idea of his own   then youre opposed to the plan  
     his expression told me that he had somehow been a step ahead of me all the time 
      okay   he went on   there is a second plan   to construct a roche apparatus         an annihilator  
      yes  sartorius has already made the preliminary calculations  it is feasible  and it wont even require any great expenditure of energy  the apparatus will generate a negative field twenty four hours a day  and for an unlimited period  
      and its effect  
      simple  it will be a negative neutrino field  ordinary matter will not be affected at all  only the       neutrino structures will be destroyed  you see  
     snow gave me a satisfied grin  i stood stock still and gaping  so that he stopped smiling  looked at me with a frown  and waited a moment before speaking 
      we abandon the first plan then  the brainwave plan  sartorius is working on the other one right now  well call it project liberation   
     i had to make a quick decision  snow was no physicist  and sartoriuss videophone was disconnected or smashed  i took the chance 
      id rather call the second idea operation slaughterhouse   
      and you ought to know  dont tell me you havent had some practice lately  only therell be a radical difference this time   no more visitors  no more phi creatures   they will disintegrate as soon as they appear  
     i nodded  and managed what i hoped was a convincing smile 
      you havent got the point  morality is one thing  but self preservation       i just dont want to get us killed  snow  
     he stared back at me suspiciously  as i showed him my scribbled equations 
      ive been working along the same lines  dont look so surprised  the neutrino theory was my idea in the first place  remember  look  negative fields can be generated all right  and ordinary matter is unaffected  but what happens to the energy that maintains the neutrino structure when it disintegrates  there must be a considerable release of that energy  assuming a kilogram of ordinary matter represents 10 8 ergs  for a phi creation we get 5 7 multiplied by 10 8  that means the equivalent of a small atomic bomb exploding inside the station  
      you mean to tell me sartorius wont have been over all this  
     it was my turn to grin maliciously 
      not necessarily  sartorius follows the frazer cajolla school  their theories would indicate that the energy potential would be given off in the form of light   powerful  yes  but not destructive  but that isnt the only theory of neutrino fields  according to cayatte  and avalov  and sion  the radiation spectrum would be much broader  at its maximum  there would be a strong burst of gamma radiation  sartorius has faith in his tutors  i dont say we cant respect that  but there are other tutors  and other theories  and another thing  snow     i could see him beginning to waver    we have to bear in mind the ocean itself  it is bound to have used the optimum means of designing its creations  it seems to me that we cant afford to back sartorius against the ocean as well as the other theories  
      give me that paper  kelvin  
     i passed it to him  and he poured over my equations 
      whats this   he pointed to a line of calculations 
      that  the transformation tensor of the magnetic field  
      give it here  
      why    i already knew his reply  
      ill have to show sartorius  
      if you say so   i shrugged   youre welcome to it  naturally  provided you realize that these theories have never been tested experimentally  neutrino structures have been abstractions until now  sartorius is relying on frazer  and ive followed sions theory  hell say im no physicist  or sion either  not from his point of view  at least  he will dispute my figures  and im not going to get into the kind of argument where he tries to browbeat me for his own satisfaction  you  i can convince  i couldnt begin to convince sartorius  and i have no intention of trying  
      then what  do  you want to do  hes already started work       
     all his earlier animation had subsided  and he spoke in a monotone  i did not know if he trusted me  and i did not much care 
      what do i want to do  whatever a man does when his life is in danger  
      ill try to contact him  maybe he can develop some kind of safety device       and then theres the first plan  would you cooperate  sartorius would agree  im sure of it  at least its worth a try  
      you think so  
 no   he snapped back   but what have we got to lose  
   i was in no hurry to accept  it was time that i needed  and snow could help me to prolong the delay 
      ill think about it  
      okay  im going   his bones creaked as he got up   well have to begin with the encephalogram   he said  rubbing at his overall as if to get rid of some invisible stain 
     without a word to rheya  he walked to the door  and after it had closed behind him i got up and crumpled the sheet of paper in my hand  i had not falsified the equations  but i doubted whether sion would have agreed with my extensions of his theory  i started abruptly  as rheyas hand touched my shoulder 
      kris  who is he  
      i told you  dr  snow  
      whats he like  
      i dont know him very well       why  
      he was giving me such a strange look  
      so youre an attractive woman         
      no  this was a different sort of look       as if          she trembled  looked up at me momentarily  then lowered her eyes   lets go back to the cabin
