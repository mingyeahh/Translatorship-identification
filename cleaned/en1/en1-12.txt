when six days passed with no reaction from the ocean  we decided to repeat the experiment  until now  the station had been located at the intersection of the forty third parallel and the 116th meridian  we moved south  maintaining a constant altitude of 1200 feet above the ocean   our radar confirmed automatic observations relayed by the artificial satellite which indicated a build up of activity in the plasma of the southern hemisphere 
     forty eight hours later  a beam of x rays modulated by my own brain patterns was bombarding the almost motionless surface of the ocean at regular intervals 
     at the end of this two day journey we had reached the outskirts of the polar region  the disc of the blue sun was setting to one side of the horizon  while on the opposite side billowing purple clouds announced the dawn of the red sun  in the sky  blinding flames and showers of green sparks clashed with the dull purple glow  even the ocean participated in the battle between the two stars  here glittering with mercurial flashes  there with crimson reflections  the smallest cloud passing overhead brightened the shining foam on the wave crests with iridescence  the blue sun had barely set when  at the meeting of ocean and sky  indistinct and drowned in blood red mist  but signalled immediately by the detectors   a symmetriad blossomed like a gigantic crystal flower  the station held its course  and after fifteen minutes the colossal ruby throbbing with dying gleams was once again hidden beneath the horizon  some minutes later  a thin column spouted thousands of yards upwards into the atmosphere  its base obscured from view by the curvature of the planet  this fantastic tree  which went on growing and gushing blood and quicksilver  marked the end of the symmetriad  the tangled branches at the top of the column melted into a huge mushroom shape  illuminated by both suns simultaneously  and carried on the wind  while the lower part bulged  broke up into heavy clusters  and slowly sank  the death throes lasted well over an hour 
     another two days passed  our x rays had irradiated a vast stretch of the ocean  and we made a final repetition of the experiment  from our observation post we spotted a chain of islets two hundred and fifty miles to the south   six rocky promontories encrusted with a snowy substance which was in fact a deposit of organic origin  proving that the mountainous formation had once been part of the ocean bed 
     we then moved south west  and skirted a chain of mountains capped by clouds which gathered during the red day  and then disappeared  ten days had elapsed since the first experiment 
     on the surface  not much was happening in the station  sartorius had programmed the experiment for automatic repetition at set intervals  i did not even know whether anybody was checking the apparatus for correct function  in fact  the calm was not as complete as it seemed  but not because of any human activity 
     i was afraid that sartorius had no real intention of abandoning the construction of the disruptor  and how would snow react when he found out that i had kept information from him and exaggerated the dangers we might run in the attempt to annihilate neutrino structures  yet neither of the two said anything further about the project  and i kept wondering why they were so silent  i vaguely suspected them of keeping something from me   perhaps they had been working in secret   and every day i inspected the room which housed the disruptor  a windowless cell situated directly underneath the main laboratory  i never found anybody in the room  and the layer of dust over the armatures and cables of the apparatus proved that it had not been touched for weeks 
     as a matter of fact  i did not meet anybody anywhere  and could not get through to snow any more  nobody answered when i tried to call the radio cabin  somebody had to be controlling the stations movements  but who  i had no idea  and oddly enough i considered the question was out of my province  the absence of response from the ocean left me equally indifferent  so much so that after two or three days i had stopped being either hopeful or apprehensive  and had completely written off the experiment and its possible results 
     for days on end  i remained sitting in the library or in my cabin  accompanied by the silent shadow of rheya  i was aware that there was an unease between us  and that my state of mindless suspension could not go on forever  obviously it was up to me to break the stalemate  but i resisted the very idea of any kind of change  i was incapable of making the most trivial decision  everything inside the station  and my relationship with rheya in particular  felt fragile and insubstantial  as if the slightest alteration could shatter the perilous equilibrium and bring down ruin  i could not tell where this feeling originated  and the strangest thing of all is that rheya too had a similar experience  when i look back on those moments today  i have a strong conviction that this atmosphere of uncertainty and suspense  and my presentiment of impending disaster  was provoked by an invisible presence which had taken possession of the station  i believe too that i can claim that this presence manifested itself just as powerfully in dreams  i have never had visions of that kind before or since  so i decided to note them down and to transcribe them approximately  in so far as my vocabulary permits  given that i can convey only fragmentary glimpses almost entirely denuded of an incommunicable horror 
     a blurred region  in the heart of vastness  far from earth and heaven  with no ground underfoot  no vault of sky overhead  nothing  i am the prisoner of an alien matter and my body is clothed in a dead  formless substance   or rather i have no body  i am that alien matter  nebulous pale pink globules surround me  suspended in a medium more opaque than air  for objects only become clear at very close range  although when they do approach they are abnormally distinct  and their presence comes home to me with a preternatural vividness  the conviction of its substantial  tangible reality is now so overwhelming that later  when i wake up  i have the impression that i have just left a state of true perception  and everything i see after opening my eyes seems hazy and unreal 
     that is how the dream begins  all around me  something is awaiting my consent  my inner acquiescence  and i know  or rather the knowledge exists  that i must not give way to an unknown temptation  for the more the silence seems to promise  the more terrible the outcome will be  yet i essentially know no such thing  because i would be afraid if i knew  and i never feel the slightest fear 
     i wait  out of the enveloping pink mist  an invisible object emerges  and touches me  inert  locked in the alien matter that encloses me  i can neither retreat nor turn away  and still i am being touched  my prison is being probed  and i feel this contact like a hand  and the hand recreates me  until now  i thought i saw  but had no eyes  now i have eyes  under the caress of the hesitant fingers  my lips and cheeks emerge from the void  and as the caress goes further i have a face  breath stirs in my chest   i exist  and recreated  i in my turn create  a face appears before me that i have never seen until now  at once mysterious and known  i strain to meet its gaze  but i cannot impose any direction on my own  and we discover one another mutually  beyond any effort of will  in an absorbed silence  i have become alive again  and i feel as if there is no limitation on my powers  this creature   a woman    stays near me  and we are motionless  the beat of our hearts combines  and all at once  out of the surrounding void where nothing exists or can exist  steals a presence of indefinable  unimaginable cruelty  the caress that created us and which wrapped us in a golden cloak becomes the crawling of innumerable fingers  our white  naked bodies dissolve into a swarm of black creeping things  and i am   we are   a mass of glutinous coiling worms  endless  and in that infinity  no  i am infinite  and i howl soundlessly  begging for death and for an end  but simultaneously i am dispersed in all directions  and my grief expands in a suffering more acute than any waking state  a pervasive  scattered pain piercing the distant blacks and reds  hard as rock and ever increasing  a mountain of grief visible in the dazzling light of another world 
     that dream was one of the simplest  i cannot describe the others  for lack of a language to convey their dread  in those dreams  i was unaware of the existence of rheya  nor was there any echo of past or recent events 
     there were also visionless dreams  where in an unmoving  clotted silence i felt myself being slowly and minutely explored  although no instrument or hand touched me  yet i felt myself being invaded through and through  i crumbled  disintegrated  and only emptiness remained  total annihilation was succeeded by such terror that its memory alone makes my heart beat faster today 
     so the days passed  each one like the next  i was indifferent to everything  fearing only the night and unable to find a means of escape from the dreams  rheya never slept  i lay beside her  fighting against sleep  and the tenderness with which i clung to her was only a pretext  a way of avoiding the moment when i would be compelled to close my eyes  i had not mentioned these nightmares to her  but she must have guessed  for her attitude involuntarily betrayed a sense of deep humiliation 
     as i say  i had not seen snow or sartorius for some time  yet snow gave occasional signs of life  he would leave a note at my door  or call me on the videophone  asking whether i had noticed any new event or change  or anything at all which could be interpreted as a response to the repeated x ray bombardments  i told him no  and asked him the same question  but there in the little screen snow only shook his head 
     on the fifteenth day after the conclusion of the experiment  i woke up earlier than usual  exhausted by the previous nights dreams  all my limbs were numbed  as if emerging from the effects of a powerful narcotic  the first rays of the red sun shone through the window  a blanket of red flame ripped over the surface of the ocean  and i realized that the vast expanse which had not been disturbed by the slightest movement in the past four days was beginning to stir  the dark ocean was abruptly covered by a thin veil of mist which seemed at the same time to have a very palpable consistency  here and there the mist shook  and tremors spread out to the horizon in all directions  now the ocean disappeared altogether beneath thick  corrugated membranes with pink swellings and pearly depressions  and these strange waves suspended above the ocean swirled suddenly and coalesced into great balls of blue green foam  a tempest of wind hurled them upwards to the height of the station  and wherever i looked  immense membranous wings were soaring in the red sky  some of these wings of foam  which blotted out the sun  were pitch black  and others shone with highlights of purple as they were exposed obliquely to the sunlight  still the phenomenon continued  as if the ocean were mutating  or shedding an old scaly skin  now and again the dark surface of the ocean could be glimpsed through a gap that the foam filled in an instant  wings of foam planed all around me  only a few yards from the window  and one swooped to rub against the window pane like a silken scarf  as the ocean went on giving birth to these fantastic birds  the first flights were already dissipating high above  decomposing at their zenith into transparent filaments 
     the station remained motionless as long as the spectacle lasted   about three hours  until night intervened  and even after the sun had set and the shadows had spread over the ocean  the lurid glow of myriads of wings could still be discerned rising into the sky  hovering in massed ranks  and climbing effortlessly towards the light 
     this performance had terrified rheya  but it was no less disconcerting for me  although its novelty ought not to have been disturbing  since two or three times a year  and oftener when luck smiled on them  solarists observed forms and creations never previously recorded 
     the following night  an hour before the blue sunrise  we witnessed another effect  the ocean was becoming phosphorescent  pools of grey light were rising and falling to the rhythm of invisible waves  isolated at first  these grey patches quickly spread and joined together  and soon made up a carpet of spectral light extending as far as the eye could see  the intensity of the light grew progressively for some fifteen to twenty minutes  then the phenomenon came to a surprising end  a pall of shadow approached from the west  stretching along a front several hundred miles wide  when this moving shadow had overtaken the station  the phosphorescent part of the ocean  retreating eastward  seemed to be trying to escape from the vast extinguisher  it was like an aurora put to flight  and retreating as far as the horizon  which was edged by a fading glow before the darkness conquered  shortly afterwards  the sun rose above the ocean wastes  which were furrowed by a few solidified waves  whose mercurial reflections played on my window 
     the phosphorescence was a recorded effect  sometimes observed before the eruption of an asymmetriad  but always indicative of a local increase in the activity of the plasma  nevertheless  in the course of the next two weeks nothing happened either inside or outside the station  except on one occasion when in the middle of the night i heard the sound of a piercing scream which came from no human throat  the shrill  protracted howling woke me out of a nightmare  and at first i thought that it was the beginning of another  before falling asleep  i had heard dull noises coming from the direction of the laboratory  part of which lay directly over my cabin  it sounded like heavy objects and machinery being shifted  when i realized that i was not dreaming  i decided that the scream also came from above  but could not understand how it managed to penetrate the sound proof ceiling  the terrible sounds went on for almost half an hour  until my nerves jangled and i was pouring with sweat  i was about to go up and investigate when the screaming stopped  to be replaced by more muffled sounds as of objects being dragged across the floor 
     rheya and i were sitting in the kitchen two days later when snow came in  he was dressed as people dress on earth after their days work  and looked like a different person  taller and older  he did not look at us  or pull up a chair  but stood at the table  opened a can of meat and began cramming it down between mouthfuls of bread  his jacket sleeve brushed against the greasy top of the can 
      look out  snow  your sleeve  
      what   he grunted  then went on stuffing himself with food as if he had not eaten for days  he poured out a glass of wine  drank it at a gulp  sighed  and wiped his lips  then he looked at me with bloodshot eyes  and mumbled 
      so youve stopped shaving  ah       
     rheya cleared the table  snow swayed on his heels  then pulled a face and sucked his teeth noisily  deliberately exaggerating the action  he stared at me insistently 
      so youve decided not to shave   i made no reply   believe me   he went on   youre making a mistake  that was how it started with him to       
      go and lie down  
      what  just when i feel like talking  listen  kelvin  perhaps it wishes well       perhaps it wants to please us but doesnt quite know how to set about the job  it spies out desires in our brains  and only two per cent of mental processes are conscious  that means it knows us better than we know ourselves  weve got to reach an understanding with it  are you listening  dont you want to  why     he was sobbing by now    why dont you shave  
      shut up        youre drunk  
      me  drunk  and what if i am  just because i drift about from one end of space to another and poke my nose into the cosmos  does that mean im not allowed to get drunk  why not  you believe in the mission of mankind  dont you  kelvin  gibarian told me about you before he started letting his beard grow       it was a very good description  just dont go to the lab  if you dont want to lose your faith  it belongs to sartorius   faust in reverse       hes looking for a cure for immortality  he is the last knight of the holy contact  the man we need  his latest discovery is pretty good too       prolonged dying  not bad  eh   agonia perpetua        of the straw       the straw hats and still you dont drink  kelvin  
     he raised his swollen eyelids and looked at rheya  who was standing quite still with her back to the wall  then he began chanting 
      o fair aphrodite  child of ocean  your divine hand        he choked with laughter   it fits  eh  kel      vin       
     he broke off in a fit of coughing 
      shut up  shut up and get out   i grated through clenched teeth 
      youre chucking me out  you too  you dont shave and you chuck me out  what about my warnings  and my advice  interstellar colleagues ought to help each other  listen kelvin  lets go down and open the traps and call out  it might hear us  but whats its name  we have named all the stars and all the planets  even though they might already have had names of their own  what a nerve  come on  lets go down  well shout it such a description of the trick its played us that it will be touched  it will make us silver symmetriads  pray to us in calculus  send us its blood stained angels  it will share our troubles and terrors  and beg us to help it die  it is already begging us  imploring us  it implores us to help it die with every one of its creations  youre not amused       but you know im just a joker  if man had more of a sense of humor  things might have turned out differently  do you know what he wants to do  he wants to punish this ocean  hear it screaming out of all its mountains at once  if you think hell never have the nerve to submit his plan to that bunch of doddering ancients who sent us here to redeem sins we havent committed  youre right   he is afraid  but he is only afraid of the little hat  he wont let anybody see the little hat  he wont dare  not faust       
     i said nothing  snows swaying increased  tears were streaming down his cheeks and onto his clothes  he went on 
      who is responsible  who is responsible for this situation  gibarian  giese  einstein  plato  all criminals       just you think  in a rocket a man takes the risk of bursting like a balloon  or freezing  or roasting  or sweating all his blood out in a single gush  before he can even cry out  and all that remains is bits of bone floating inside armored hulls  in accordance with the laws of newton as corrected by einstein  those two milestones in our progress  down the road we go  all in good faith  and see where it gets us  think about our success  kelvin  think about our cabins  the unbreakable plates  the immortal sinks  legions of faithful wardrobes  devoted cupboards       i wouldnt be talking this way if i werent drunk  but sooner or later somebody was bound to say it  werent they  you sit there like a baby in a 
slaughterhouse  and you let your beard grow       whos to blame  find out for yourself        he turned slowly and went out  putting an arm out against the doorpost to steady himself  then his footsteps died away along the corridor 
     i tried not to look at rheya  but my eyes were drawn to hers in spite of myself  i wanted to get up  take her in my arms and stroke her hair  i did not move
