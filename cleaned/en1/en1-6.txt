My face and hands were badly burnt  I remembered noticing a jar of anti burn ointment when I was looking for sleeping pills for Rheya  I was in no mood to laugh at my naivete   so I went back to my room 
     I opened the door  The room was glowing in the red twilight  Someone was sitting in the armchair where Rheya had knelt  For a second or two  I was paralysed with terror  filled with an overwhelming desire to turn and run  Then the seated figure raised its head  it was Snow  His legs crossed  still wearing the acid stained trousers  he was looking through some papers  a pile of which lay on a small table beside him  He put down those he was holding in his hand  let his glasses slide down his nose  and scowled up at me 
     Without saying a word  I went to the basin  took the ointment out of the medicine chest and applied it to my forehead and cheeks  Fortunately my face was not too swollen and my eyes  which I had closed instinctively  did not seem to be inflamed  I lanced some large blisters on my temples and cheekbones with a sterilized needle  they exuded a serous liquid  which I mopped up with an antiseptic pad  Then I applied some gauze dressing 
     Snow watched me throughout these first aid operations  but I paid no attention to him  When at last I had finished  and my burns had become even more painful   I sat myself down in the other chair  I had first to remove Rheyas dress   that apparently quite normal dress which was nevertheless devoid of fastenings 
     Snow  his hands clasped around one bony knee  continued to observe me with a critical air 
      Well  are you ready to have a chat   he asked 
     I did not answer  I was busy replacing a piece of gauze which had slipped down one cheek 
      Youve had a visitor  havent you  
      Yes   I answered curtly 
     He had begun the conversation on a note which I found displeasing 
      And youve rid yourself of it already  Well  well  That was quick  
     He touched his forehead  which was still peeling and mottled with pink patches of new skim  I was thunderstruck  Why had I not realized before the implications of Snows and Sartoriuss sunburn  No one exposed himself to the sun here 
     Without noticing my sudden change of expression he went on 
      I imagine you didnt try extreme methods straight away  What did you use first   drugs  poison  judo  
      Do you want to discuss the thing seriously or play the fool  If you dont want to help  you can leave me in peace  
     He half closed his eyes 
      Sometimes one plays the fool in spite of oneself  Did you try the rope  or the hammer  Or the well aimed ink bottle  like Luther  No   He grimaced   Arent you a fast worker  The basin is still intact  you havent banged your head against the walls  you havent even turned the room upside down  One  two and into the rocket  just like that   He looked at his watch   Consequently  we have two or three hours at our disposal         Am I getting on your nerves   he added  with a disagreeable smile  
      Yes   I said curtly 
      Really  Well  if I tell you a little story  will you believe me  
     I said nothing 
     Still with that hideous smile  he went on 
      It started with Gibarian  He locked himself in his cabin and refused to talk to us except through the door  And can you guess what we thought  
     I remained silent 
      Naturally  we thought he had gone mad  He let a bit of it out   through the locked door   but not everything  You may wonder why he didnt tell us that there was someone with him  Oh   suum cuique   But he was a true scientist  He begged us to let him take his chance  
      What chance  
      He was obviously doing his damnedest to solve the problem  to get to the bottom of it  He worked day and night  You know what he was doing  You must know         Those calculations  in the drawer of the radio cabin   were they his         Yes  
      How long did it go on  
      This visit  About a week       We thought he was suffering from hallucinations  or having a nervous breakdown  I gave him some scopolamine  
      Gave him  
      Yes  He took it  but not for himself  He tried it out on someone else  
      What did you do  
      On the third day we had decided  if all else failed  to break down the door  maybe injuring his self esteem  but at least curing him  
      Ah       
      Yes  
      So  in that locker         
      Yes  my friend  quite  But in the meantime  we too had received visitors  We had our hands full  and didnt have a chance to tell him what was going on  Now its       its become a routine  
     He spoke so softly that I guessed rather than heard the last few words 
      I still dont understand   I exclaimed   If you listened at his door  you must have heard two voices  
      No  we heard only his voice  There were strange noises  but we thought they came from him too  
      Only his voice  But how is it that you didnt hear       her  
      I dont know  I have the rudiments of a theory about it  but Ive dropped it for the moment  No point getting bogged down in details  But what about you  You must already have seen something yesterday  otherwise you would have taken us for lunatics  
      I thought it was I who had gone mad  
      So you didnt see anyone  
      I saw someone  
      Who  
     I gave him a long look   he no longer wore even the semblance of a smile   and answered 
      That       that black woman        He was leaning forward  and as I spoke his body almost imperceptibly relaxed   You might have warned me  
      I did warn you  
      You could have chosen a better way  
      It was the only way possible  I didnt know what you would see  No one could know  no one ever knows       
      Listen  Snow  I want to ask you something  Youve had some experience of this       phenomenon  Will she       will the person who visited me today         
      Will she come back  do you mean  
     I nodded 
      Yes and no   he said 
      What does that mean  
      She       this person will come back as though nothing had happened  just as she was at the beginning of her first visit  More precisely  she will appear not to realize what you did to get rid of her  If you abide by the rules  she wont be aggressive  
      What rules  
      That depends on the circumstances  
      Snow  
      What  
      Dont lets waste time talking in riddles  
      In riddles  Kelvin  Im afraid you still dont understand   His eyes glittered   All right  then   he went on  brutally   Can you tell me who your visitor was  
     I swallowed my saliva and turned away  I did not want to look at him  I would have preferred to be dealing with anyone else but him  but I had no choice  A piece of gauze came unstuck and fell on my hand  I gave a start 
      A woman who        I stopped   She died  An injection       
      Suicide  
      Yes  
      Is that all  
     He waited  Seeing that I remained silent  he murmured 
      No  its not all       
     I looked up quickly  he was not looking at me 
      How did you guess   He said nothing   Its true  theres more to it than that   I moistened my lips   We quarrelled  Or rather  I lost my temper and said a lot of things I didnt mean  I packed my bags and cleared out  She had given me to understand       not in so many words   when ones lived together for years its not necessary  I was certain she didnt mean it  that she wouldnt dare  shed be too afraid  and I told her so  Next day  I remembered Id left these       these ampoules in a drawer  She knew they were there  Id brought them back from the laboratory because I needed them  and I had explained to her that the effect of a heavy dose would be lethal  I was a bit worried  I wanted to go back and get them  but I thought that would give the impression that Id taken her remarks seriously  By the third day I was really worried and made up my mind to go back  When I arrived  she was dead  
      You poor innocent  
     I looked up with a start  But Snow was not making fun of me  It seemed to me that I was seeing him now for the first time  His face was grey  and the deep lines between cheek and nose were evidence of an unutterable exhaustion  he looked a sick man 
     Curiously awed  I asked him 
      Why did you say that  
      Because its a tragic story   Seeing that I was upset  he added  hastily   No  no  you still dont understand  Of course its a terrible burden to carry around  and you must feel like a murderer  but       there are worse things  
      Oh  really  
      Yes  really  And Im almost glad that you refuse to believe me  Certain events  which have actually happened  are horrible  but what is more horrible still is what hasnt happened  what has never existed  
      What are you saying   I asked  my voice faltering 
     He shook his head from side to side 
      A normal man   he said   What is a normal man  A man who has never committed a disgraceful act  Maybe  but has he never had uncontrollable thoughts  Perhaps he hasnt  But perhaps something  a phantasm  rose up from somewhere within him  ten or thirty years ago  something which he suppressed and then forgot about  which he doesnt fear since he knows he will never allow it to develop and so lead to any action on his part  And now  suddenly  in broad daylight  he comes across this thing       this thought  embodied  riveted to him  indestructible  He wonders where he is       Do you know where he is  
      Where  
      Here   whispered Snow   on Solaris  
      But what does it mean  After all  you and Sartorius arent criminals         
      And you call yourself a psychologist  Kelvin  Who hasnt had  at some moment in his life  a crazy daydream  an obsession  Imagine       imagine a fetishist who becomes infatuated with  lets say  a grubby piece of cloth  and who threatens and entreats and defies every risk in order to acquire this beloved bit of rag  A peculiar idea  isnt it  A man who at one and the same time is ashamed of the object of his desire and cherishes it above everything else  a man who is ready to sacrifice his life for his love  since the feeling he has for it is perhaps as overwhelming as Romeos feeling for Juliet  Such cases exist  as you know  So  in the same way  there are things  situations  that no one has dared to externalize  but which the mind has produced by accident in a moment of aberration  of madness  call it what you will  At the next stage  the idea becomes flesh and blood  Thats all  
     Stupefied  my mouth dry  I repeated 
      Thats all   My head was spinning   And what about the Station  What has it got to do with the Station  
      Its almost as if youre purposely refusing to understand   he groaned   Ive been talking about Solaris the whole time  solely about Solaris  If the truth is hard to swallow  its not my fault  Anyhow  after what youve already been through  you ought to be able to hear me out  We take off into the cosmos  ready for anything  for solitude  for hardship  for exhaustion  death  Modesty forbids us to say so  but there are times when we think pretty well of ourselves  And yet  if we examine it more closely  our enthusiasm turns out to be all sham  We dont want to conquer the cosmos  we simply want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the frontiers of the cosmos  For us  such and such a planet is as arid as the Sahara  another as frozen as the North Pole  yet another as lush as the Amazon basin  We are humanitarian and chivalrous  we dont want to enslave other races  we simply want to bequeath them our values and take over their heritage in exchange  We think of ourselves as the Knights of the Holy Contact  This is another lie  We are only seeking Man  We have no need of other worlds  We need mirrors  We dont know what to do with other worlds  A single world  our own  suffices us  but we cant accept it for what it is  We are searching for an ideal image of our own world  we go in quest of a planet  of a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of our primeval past  At the same time  there is something inside us which we dont like to face up to  from which we try to protect ourselves  but which nevertheless remains  since we dont leave Earth in a state of primal innocence  We arrive here as we are in reality  and when the page is turned and that reality is revealed to us   that part of our reality which we would prefer to pass over in silence   then we dont like it any more  
     I had listened to him patiently 
      But what on earth are you talking about  
      Im talking about what we all wanted  contact with another civilization  Now weve got it  And we can observe  through a microscope  as it were  our own monstrous ugliness  our folly  our shame   His voice shook with rage 
      So       you think its       the ocean  That the ocean is responsible for it all  But why  Im not asking how  Im simply asking why  Do you seriously think that it wants to toy with us  or punish us   a sort of elementary demonomania  A planet dominated by a huge devil  who satisfies the demands of his satanic humors by sending succubi to haunt the members of a scientific expedition         Snow  you cant believe anything so absurd  
     He muttered under his breath 
      This devil isnt such a fool as all that       
     I looked at him in amazement  Perhaps what had happened  assuming that we had experienced it in our right minds  had finally driven him over the edge  A reaction psychosis 
     He was laughing to himself 
      Making your diagnosis  Dont be in too much of a hurry  Youve only been through one ordeal   and that a reasonably mild one  
      Oh  so the devil had pity on me  
     I was beginning to weary of this conversation 
      What is it you want exactly   Snow went on   Do you want me to tell you what this mass of metamorphic plasma    x  billion tons of metamorphic plasma   is scheming against us  Perhaps nothing         What do you mean  nothing  
     Snow smiled 
      You must know that science is concerned with phenomena rather than causes  The phenomena here began to manifest themselves eight or nine days after that X ray experiment  Perhaps the ocean reacted to the irradiation with a counter irradiation  perhaps it probed our brains and penetrated to some kind of psychic tumor  
     I pricked up my ears 
      Tumor  
      Yes  isolated psychic processes  enclosed  stifled  encysted   foci smouldering under the ashes of memory  It deciphered them and made use of them  in the same way as one uses a recipe or a blue print  You know how alike the asymmetric crystalline structures of a chromosome are to those of the DNA molecule  one of the constituents of the cerebrosides which constitute the substratum of the memory processes  This genetic substance is a plasma which remembers  The ocean has read us by this means  registering the minutest details  with the result that       well  you know the result  But for what purpose  Bah  At any rate  not for the purpose of destroying us  It could have annihilated us much more easily  As far as one can tell  given its technological resources  it could have done anything it wished   confronted me with your double  and you with mine  for example  
      So thats why you were so alarmed when I arrived  the first evening  
      Yes  In fact  how do you know it hasnt done so  How do you know Im really the same old Ratface who landed here two years ago  
     He went on laughing silently  enjoying my discomfiture  then he growled 
      No  no  thats enough of that  Were two happy mortals  I could kill you  you could kill me  
      And the others  cant they be killed  
      I dont advise you to try   a horrible sight  
      Is there no means of killing them  
      I dont know  Certainly not with poison  or a weapon  or by injection       
      What about a gamma pistol  
      Would you risk it  
      Since we know theyre not human       
      In a certain subjective sense  they  are  human  They know nothing whatsoever about their origins  You must have noticed that  
      Yes  But then  how do you explain         
      They       the whole thing is regenerated with extraordinary rapidity  at an incredible speed   in the twinkling of an eye  Then they start behaving again as              As  
      As we remember them  as they are engraved on our memories  following which       
      Did Gibarian know   I interrupted 
      As much as we do  you mean  
      Yes  
      Very probably  
      Did he say anything to you         No  I found a book in his room       
     I leapt to my feet 
       The Little Apocrypha   
      Yes   He looked at me suspiciously   Who could have told you about that  
     I shook my head 
      Dont worry  you can see that Ive burnt my skin and that its not exactly renewing itself  No  Gibarian left a letter addressed to me in his cabin  
      A letter  What did it say  
      Nothing much  It was more of a note than a letter  with bibliographic references   allusions to the supplement to the Annual and to the  Apocrypha   What is this  Apocrypha   
      An antique which seems to have some relevance to our situation  Here   He drew from his pocket a small  leatherbound volume  scuffed at the edges  and handed it to me 
     I grabbed the little book 
      And what about Sartorius  
      Him  Everyone has his own way of coping  Sartorius is trying to remain normal   that is  to preserve his respectability as an envoy of an official mission  
      Youre joking  
      No  Im quite serious  We were together on another occasion  I wont bother you with the details  but there were eight of us and we were down to our last 1000 pounds of oxygen  One after another  we gave up our chores  and by the end we all had beards except Sartorius  He was the only one who shaved and polished his shoes  Hes like that  Now  of course  he can only pretend  act a part   or else commit a crime         A crime  
      Perhaps that isnt quite the right word  Divorce by ejection  Does that sound better  
      Very funny  
      Suggest something else if you dont like it  
      Oh  leave me alone  
      No  lets discuss the thing seriously  You know pretty well as much as I do by now  Have you got a plan  
      No  none  I havent the least idea what Ill do when       when she comes back  She will return  if Ive understood you correctly  
      Its on the cards  
      How do they get in  The Station is hermetically sealed  Perhaps the layer on the outer hull       
     He shook his head 
      The outer hull is in perfect condition  I dont know where they get in  Usually  theyre there when you wake up  and you have to sleep eventually  
      Could you barricade yourself securely inside a cabin  
      The barricades wouldnt survive for long  Theres only one solution  and you can guess what that is       
     We both stood up 
      Just a minute  Snow  Youre suggesting we liquidate the Station and you expect me to take the initiative and accept the responsibility  
      Its not as simple as that  Obviously  we could get out  if only as far as the satellite  and send an SOS from there  Of course  well be regarded as lunatics  well be shut up in a mad house on Earth   unless we have the sense to retract  A distant planet  isolation  collective derangement   our case wont seem at all out of the ordinary  But at least wed be better off in a mental home than we are here  a quiet garden  little white cells  nurses  supervised walks       
     Hands in his pockets  staring fixedly at a corner of the room  he spoke with the utmost seriousness 
     The red sun had disappeared over the horizon and the ocean was a sombre desert  mottled with dying gleams  the last rays lingering among the long tresses of the waves  The sky was ablaze  Purple edged clouds drifted across this dismal red and black world 
      Well  do you want to get out  yes or no  Or not yet  
      Always the fighter  If you knew the full implications of what youre asking  you wouldnt be so insistent  Its not a matter of what I want  its a matter of whats possible         Such as what  
      Thats the point  I dont know  
      We stay here then  Do you think well find some way         
     Thin  sickly looking  his peeling face deeply lined  he turned towards me 
      It might be worth our while to stay  Were unlikely to learn anything about  it   but about ourselves       
     He turned  picked up his papers  and went out  I opened my mouth to detain him  but no sound escaped my lips 
     There was nothing I could do now except wait  I went to the window and ran my eyes absently over the dark red glimmer of the shadowed ocean  For a moment  I thought of locking myself inside one of the capsules on the hangar deck  but it was not an idea worth considering for long  sooner or later  I should have to come out again 
     I sat by the window  and began to leaf through the book Snow had given me  The glowing twilight lit up the room and colored the pages  It was a collection of articles and treatises edited by an Otho Ravintzer  Ph D   and its general level was immediately obvious  Every science engenders some pseudo science  inspiring eccentrics to explore freakish by ways  astronomy has its parodists in astrology  chemistry used to have them in alchemy  It was not surprising  therefore  that Solaristics  in its early days  had set off an explosion of marginal cogitations  Ravintzers book was full of this sort of intellectual speculation  prefaced  it is only fair to add  by an introduction in which the editor dissociated himself from some of the texts reproduced  He considered  with some justice  that such a collection could provide an invaluable period document as much for the historian as for the psychologist of science 
     Bertons report  divided into two parts and complete with a summary of his log  occupied the place of honor in the book 
     From 14 00 hours to 16 40 hours  by expedition time  the entries in the log were laconic and negative 
     Altitude 3000   or 3500   2500 feet  nothing visible  ocean empty   The same words recurred over and over again 
     Then  at 16 40 hours   A red mist rising  Visibility 700 yards  Ocean empty 
     17 00 hours  fog thickening  visibility 400 yards  with clear patches  Descending to 600 feet 
     17 20 hours  in fog  Altitude 600  Visibility 20 40 yards  Climbing to 1200 
     17 45  altitude 1500  Pall of fog to horizon  Funnel shaped openings through which I can see ocean surface  Attempting to enter one of these clearings  something is moving 
     17 52  have spotted what appears to be a waterspout  it is throwing up a yellow foam  Surrounded by a wall of fog  Altitude 300  Descending to 60 feet  
     The extract from Bertons log stopped at this point  There followed his case history  or  more precisely  the statement dictated by Berton and interrupted at intervals by questions from the members of the Commission of Enquiry 
  
     BERTON  When I reached 100 feet it became very difficult to maintain altitude because of the violent gusts of wind inside the cone  I had to hang on to the controls and for a short period   about ten or fifteen minutes   I did not look outside  I realized too late that a powerful undertow was dragging me back into the fog  It wasnt like an ordinary fog  it was a thick colloidal substance which coated my windows  I had a lot of trouble cleaning them  that fog   or glue rather   was obstinate stuff  Due to this resistance  the speed of my rotor blades was reduced by thirty percent and I began losing height  I was afraid of capsizing on the waves  but  even at full power  I could maintain altitude but not increase it  I still had four booster rockets left but felt the situation was not yet desperate enough to use them  The aircraft was shaken by shuddering vibrations that grew more and more violent  Thinking my rotor blades must have become coated with the gluey substance  I glanced at the overload indicator  but to my surprise it read zero  Since entering the fog  I had not seen the sun   only a red glow  I continued to fly around in the hope of emerging into one of the funnels  which  after half an hour  was what happened  I found myself in a new well  perfectly cylindrical in shape  and several hundred yards in diameter  The walls of the cylinder were formed by an enormous whirlpool of fog  spiralling upwards  I struggled to keep in the middle  where the wind was less violent  It was then that I noticed a change in the oceans surface  The waves had almost completely disappeared  and the upper layer of the fluid   or whatever the ocean is made of   was becoming transparent  with murky streaks here and there which gradually dissolved until  finally  it was perfectly clear  I could see distinctly to a depth of several yards  I saw a sort of yellow sludge which was sprouting vertical filaments  When these filaments emerged above the surface  they had a glassy sheen  Then they began to exuam   they frothed   until the foam solidified  it was like a very thick treacle  These glutinous filaments merged and became intertwined  great bubbles swelled up on the surface and slowly began to change shape  Suddenly I realized that my machine was being driven towards the wall of fog  I had to manoeuver against the wind  and when I was able to look down again  I saw something which looked like a garden  Yes  a garden  Trees  hedges  paths   but it wasnt a real garden  it was all made of the same substance  which had hardened and by now looked like yellow plaster  Beneath this garden  the ocean glittered  I came down as low as I dared in order to take a closer look 
     QUESTION  Did the trees and plants you saw have leaves on them 
     BERTON  No  the shapes were only approximate  like a model garden  Thats exactly what it was like  a model  but lifesize  All of a sudden  it began to crack  it broke up and split into dark crevices  a thick white liquid ran out and collected into pools  or else drained away  The earthquake became more violent  the whole thing boiled over and was buried beneath the foam  At the same time  the walls of the fog began to close in  I gained height rapidly and came clear at 1000 feet 
     QUESTION  Are you absolutely sure that what you saw resembled a garden   there was no other possible interpretation 
     BERTON  Yes  I noticed several details  For example  I remember seeing a place where there were some boxes in a row  I realized later that they were probably beehives 
     QUESTION  You realized later  But not at the time  not at the moment when you actually saw them 
     BERTON  No  because everything looked as though it were made of plaster  But I saw something else 
     QUESTION  What was that 
     BERTON  I saw things which I cant put a name to  because I didnt have time to examine them carefully  Under some bushes I thought I saw tools  long objects with prongs  They might have been plaster models of garden tools  But Im not absolutely certain  Whereas Im sure  quite certain  that I recognized an apiary 
     QUESTION  It didnt occur to you that it might be an hallucination 
     BERTON  No  I thought it was a mirage  It never occurred to me that it was an hallucination because I felt perfectly well  and I had never seen anything like it before   When I reached 1000 feet and took another look at the fog  it was pitted with more irregularly shaped holes  rather like a piece of cheese  Some of these holes were completely hollow  and I could see the ocean waves  others were only shallow saucers in which something was bubbling  I descended another well and saw   the altimeter read 120 feet   I saw a wall lying beneath the ocean surface  It wasnt very deep and I could see it clearly beneath the waves  It seemed to be the wall of a huge building  pierced with rectangular openings  like windows  I even thought I could see something moving behind them  but I couldnt be absolutely certain of that  The wall slowly broke the surface and a mucous bubbling liquid streamed down its sides  Then it suddenly broke in half and disappeared into the depths 
     I regained height and continued to fly above the fog  the machine almost touching it  until I discovered another clearing  much larger than the previous one 
     While I was still some distance away  I noticed a pale  almost white  object floating on the surface  My first thought was that it was Fechners flying suit  especially as it looked vaguely human in form  I brought the aircraft round sharply  afraid of losing my way and being unable to find the same spot again  The shape  the body  was moving  sometimes it seemed to be standing upright in the trough of the waves  I accelerated and went down so low that the machine bounced gently  I must have hit the crest of a huge wave I was overflying   The body   yes  it was a human body  not an atmosphere suit   the body was moving 
     QUESTION  Did you see its face  
     BERTON  Yes  
     QUESTION  Who was it  
     BERTON  A child 
     QUESTION  What child  Did you recognize it  
     BERTON  No  At any rate  I dont remember having seen it before  Besides  when I got closer   when I was forty yards away  or even sooner   I realized that it was no ordinary child 
     QUESTION  What do you mean 
     BERTON  Ill explain  At first  I couldnt understand what worried me about it  it was only after a minute or two that I realized  this child was extraordinarily large  Enormous  in fact  Stretched out horizontally  its body rose twelve feet above the surface of the ocean  I swear  I remembered that when I touched the wave  its face was a little higher than mine  even though my cockpit must have been at least ten feet above the ocean 
     QUESTION  If it was as big as that  what makes you say it was a child 
     BERTON  Because it was a tiny child  
     QUESTION  Do you realize  Berton  that your answer doesnt make sense 
     BERTON  On the contrary  I could see its face  and it was a very young child  Besides  its proportions corresponded exactly to the proportions of a childs body  It was a       babe in arms  No  I exaggerate  It was probably two or three years old  It had black hair and blue eyes   enormous blue eyes  It was naked   completely naked   like a newborn baby  It was wet  or I should say glossy  its skin was shiny  I was shattered  I no longer thought it was a mirage  I could see this child so distinctly  It rose and fell with the waves  but apart from this general motion  it was making other movements  and they were horrible  
     QUESTION  Why  What was it doing  
     BERTON  It was more like a doll in a museum  only a living doll  It opened and closed its mouth  it made various gestures  horrible gestures  
     QUESTION  What do you mean 
     BERTON  I was watching it from about twenty yards away   I dont suppose I went any closer  But  as Ive already told you  it was enormous  I could see very clearly  Its eyes sparkled and you really would have thought it was a living child  if it hadnt been for the movements  the gestures  as though someone was trying       It was as though someone else was responsible for the gestures      
     QUESTION  Try to be more explicit  
     BERTON  Its difficult  Im talking of an impression  more of an intuition  I didnt analyze it  but I knew that those gestures werent natural 
     QUESTION  Do you mean  for example  that the hands didnt move as human hands would move  because the joints were not sufficiently supple 
     BERTON  No  not at all  But       these movements had no meaning  Each of our movements means something  more or less  serves some purpose      
     QUESTION  Do you think so  The movements of an infant dont have much meaning 
     BERTON  I know  But an infants movements are confused  random  uncoordinated  The movements I saw were       er       yes  thats it  they were methodical movements  They were performed one after another  like a series of exercises  as though someone had wanted to make a study of what this child was capable of doing with its hands  its torso  its mouth  The face was more horrifying than the rest  because the human face has an expression  and this face       I dont know how to describe it  It was alive  yes  but it wasnt human  Or rather  the features as a whole  the eyes  the complexion  were  but the expression  the movements of the face  were certainly not  
     QUESTION  Were they grimaces  Do you know what happens to a persons face during an epileptic fit  
     BERTON  Yes  Ive watched an epileptic fit  I know what you mean  No  it was something quite different  Epilepsy provokes spasms  convulsions  The movements Im talking about were fluid  continuous  graceful       melodious  if one can say that of a movement  Its the nearest definition I can think of   But this face       a face cant divide itself into two   one half gay  the other sad  one half scowling and the other amiable  one half frightened and the other triumphant  But thats how it was with this childs face  In addition to that  all these movements and changes of expression succeeded one another with unbelievable rapidity  I stayed down there a very short time  perhaps ten seconds  perhaps less  
     QUESTION  And you claim to have seen all that in such a short time  Besides  how do you know how long you were there  Did you check your chronometer  
     BERTON  No  but Ive been flying for seventeen years and  in my job  one can measure instinctively  to the nearest second  the duration of what would be called an instant of time  Its an acquired faculty  and essential for successful navigation  A pilot isnt worth his salt if he cant tell whether a particular phenomenon lasts five or ten seconds  whatever the circumstances  Its the same with observation  We learn  over the years  to take in everything at a glance 
     QUESTION  Is that all you saw 
     BERTON  No  but I dont remember the rest so precisely  I suppose I must already have seen more than enough  my attention faltered  The fog began to close in  and I had to climb  I climbed  and for the first time in my life I all but capsized  My hands were shaking so much that I had difficulty in handling the controls  I think I shouted something  called up the base  even though I knew we were not in radio contact 
     QUESTION  Did you then try and get back  
     BERTON  No  In the end  having gamed height  I thought to myself that Fechner was probably in the bottom of one of the wells  I know it sounds crazy  but thats what I thought  I told myself that everything was possible  and that it would also be possible for me to find Fechner  I decided to investigate every clearing I came across along my route  At the third attempt I gave up  When I had regained height  I knew it was useless to persist after what I had just seen on this  the third  occasion  I couldnt go on any longer  I should add  as you already know  that I was suffering from bouts of nausea and that I vomited in the cockpit  I couldnt understand it  I have never been sick in my life 
     COMMENT  It was a symptom of poisoning  
     BERTON  Perhaps  I dont know  But what I saw on this third occasion I did not imagine  That was not the effect of poisoning 
     QUESTION  How can you possibly know  
     BERTON  It wasnt an hallucination  An hallucination is created by ones own brain  wouldnt you say  
     COMMENT  Yes 
     BERTON  Well  my brain couldnt have created what I saw  Ill never believe that  My brain wouldnt have been capable of it 
     COMMENT  Get on with describing what it was 
     BERTON  Before I do so  I should like to know how the statements Ive already made will be interpreted 
     QUESTION  What does that matter 
     BERTON  For me  it matters very much indeed  I have said that I saw things which I shall never forget  If the Commission recognizes  even with certain reservations  that my testimony is credible  and that a study of the ocean must be undertaken   I mean a study orientated in the light of my statements   then Ill tell everything  But if the Commission considers that it is all delusions  then I refuse to say anything more 
     QUESTION  Why 
     BERTON  Because the contents of my hallucinations belong to me and I dont have to give an account of them  whereas I am obliged to give an account of what I saw on Solaris 
     QUESTION  Does that mean that you refuse to answer any more questions until the expedition authorities have announced their findings  You realize  of course  that the Commission isnt empowered to take an immediate decision 
     BERTON  Yes 
     The first minute ended here  There followed a fragment of the second minute drawn up eleven days later  
     PRESIDENT        after due consideration  the Commission  composed of three doctors  three biologists  a physicist  a mechanical engineer and the deputy head of the expedition  has reached the conclusion that Bertons report is symptomatic of hallucinations caused by atmospheric poisoning  consequent upon inflammation of the associative zone of the cerebral cortex  and that Bertons account bears no  or at any rate no appreciable  relation to reality 
     BERTON  Excuse me  what does  no appreciable relation  mean  In what proportion is reality appreciable or not 
     PRESIDENT  I havent finished  Independently of these conclusions  the 
Commission has duly registered a dissenting vote from Dr  Archibald Messenger  who considers the phenomena described by Berton to be objectively possible and declares himself in favor of a scrupulous investigation  
     BERTON  I repeat my question 
     PRESIDENT  The answer is simple   No appreciable relation to reality  means that phenomena actually observed may have formed the basis of your hallucinations  In the course of a nocturnal stroll  a perfectly sane man can imagine he sees a living creature in a bush stirred by the wind  Such illusions are all the more likely to affect an explorer lost on a strange planet and breathing a poisonous atmosphere  This verdict is in no way prejudicial to you  Berton  Will you now be good enough to let us know your decision 
      BERTON  First of all  I should like to know the possible consequences of this dissenting vote of Dr  Messengers 
     PRESIDENT  Virtually none  We shall carry on our work along the lines originally laid down 
     BERTON  Is our interview on record 
     PRESIDENT  Yes 
     BERTON  In that case  I should like to say that although the Commissions decision may not be prejudicial to me personally  it is prejudicial to the spirit of the expedition itself  Consequently  as I have already stated  I refuse to answer any further questions 
     PRESIDENT  Is that all 
     BERTON  Yes  Except that I should like to meet Dr  Messenger  Is that possible 
     PRESIDENT  Of course 
     That was the end of the second minute  At the bottom of the page there was a note in minuscule handwriting to the effect that  the following day  Dr  Messenger had talked to Berton for nearly three hours  As a result of this conversation  Messenger had once more begged the expedition Council to undertake further investigations in order to check the pilots statements  Berton had produced some new and extremely convincing revelations  which Messenger could not divulge unless the Council reversed its negative decision  The Council   Shannahan  Timolis and Trahier   rejected the motion and the affair was closed 
     The book also reproduced a photocopy of the last page of a letter  or rather  the draft of a letter  found by Messengers executors after his death  Ravintzer  in spite of his researches  had been unable to discover if this letter had ever been sent 
            obtuse minds  a pyramid of stupidity     the text began   Anxious to preserve its authority  the Council   more precisely Shannahan and Timolis  Trahiers vote doesnt count    has rejected my recommendations  Now I am taking the matter up directly with the Institute  but  as you can well imagine  my protestations wont convince anybody  Bound as I am by oath  I cant  alas  reveal to you what Berton told me  If the Council disregarded Bertons testimony  it was basically because Berton has no scientific training  although any scientist would envy the presence of mind and the gift of observation shown by this pilot  I should be grateful if you could send me the following information by return post 
i  Fechners biography  in particular details about his childhood 
ii  Everything you know about his family  facts and dates   he probably lost his parents while still a child       iii The topography of the place where he was brought up 
     I should like once more to tell you what I think about all this  As you know  some time after the departure of Fechner and Carucci  a spot appeared in the centre of the red sun  This chromospheric eruption caused a magnetic storm chiefly over the southern hemisphere  where our base was situated  according to the information provided by the satellite  and the radio links were cut  The other parties were scouring the planets surface over a relatively restricted area  whereas Fechner and Carucci had travelled a considerable distance from the base 
     Never  since our arrival on the planet  had we observed such a persistent fog or such an unremitting silence 
     I imagine that what Berton saw was one of the phases of a kind of Operation Man which this viscous monster was engaged in  The source of all the various forms observed by Berton is Fechner   or rather  Fechners brain  subjected to an unimaginable psychic dissection for the purposes of a sort of re creation  an experimental reconstruction  based on impressions  undoubtedly the most durable ones  engraved on his memory 
     I know this sounds fantastic  I know that I may be mistaken  But do please help me  At the moment  I am on the  Alaric   where I look forward to receiving your reply       Yours  A  
  
     It was growing dark  and I could scarcely make out the blurred print at the top of the grey page   the last page describing Bertons adventure  For my part  my own experience led me to regard Berton as a trustworthy witness 
     I turned towards the window  A few clouds still glowed like dying embers above the horizon  The ocean was invisible  blanketed by the purple darkness 
     The strips of paper fluttered idly beneath the air vents  There was a whiff of ozone in the still  warm air 
     There was nothing heroic in our decision to remain on the Station  The time for heroism was over  vanished with the era of the great interplanetary triumphs  of daring expeditions and sacrifices  Fechner  the oceans first victim  belonged to a distant past  I had almost stopped caring about the identity of Snows and Sartoriuss visitors  Soon  I told myself  we would cease to be ashamed  to keep ourselves apart  If we could not get rid of our visitors  we would accustom ourselves to their presence  learn to live with them  If their Creator altered the rules of the game  we would adapt ourselves to the new rules  even if at first we jibbed or rebelled  even if one of us despaired and killed himself  Eventually  a certain equilibrium would be reestablished 
     Night had come  no different from many nights on Earth  Now I could make out only the white contours of the basin and the smooth surface of the mirror 
     I stood up  Groping my way to the basin  I fumbled among the objects which cluttered up the shelf  and found the packet of cotton wool  I washed my face with a damp wad and stretched out on the bed
     A moth fluttered its wings       no  it was the ventilator strip  The whirring stopped  then started up again  I could no longer see the window  everything had merged into darkness  A mysterious ray of light pierced the blackness and lingered in front of me   against the wall  or the black sky  I remembered how the blank stare of the night had frightened me the day before  and I smiled at the thought  I was no longer afraid of the night  I was not afraid of anything  I raised my wrist and looked at the ring of phosphorescent figures  another hour  and the blue day would dawn 
     I breathed deeply  savoring the darkness  my mind empty and at rest 
     Shifting my position  I felt the flat shape of the tape recorder against my hip  Gibarian  his voice immortalized on the spools of tape  I had forgotten to resurrect him  to listen to him   the only thing I could do for him any more  I took the tape recorder out of my pocket in order to hide it under the bed 
     I heard a rustling sound  the door opened 
      Kris   An anxious voice whispered my name   Kris  are you there  Its so dark         
     I answered 
      Yes  Im here  Dont be frightened  come
