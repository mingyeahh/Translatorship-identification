 Kris  is it the experiment thats on your mind  
     The sound of her voice made me start with surprise  I had been lying in the dark for hours with my eyes open  unable to sleep  Not hearing Rheyas breathing  I had forgotten her  letting myself drift in a tide of aimless speculation  The waking dream had lured me out of sight of the measure and meaning of reality   How did you know I wasnt asleep    Your breathing changes when you are asleep   she said gently  as if to apologize for her question   I didnt want to interfere       If you cant answer  dont  
      Why would I not tell you  Anyway youve guessed right  it is the experiment  
      What do they expect to achieve   
      They dont know themselves  Something  Anything  It isnt Operation Brainwave  its Operation Desperation  Really  one of us ought to have the courage to call the experiment off and shoulder the responsibility for the decision  but the majority reckons that that kind of courage would be a sign of cowardice  and the first step in a retreat  They think it would mean an undignified surrender for mankind   as if there was any dignity in floundering and drowning in what we dont understand and never will   I stopped  but a new access of rage quickly built up   Needless to say theyre not short of arguments  They claim that even if we fail to establish contact we wont have been wasting our time investigating the plasma  and that we shall eventually uncover the secret of matter   They know very well that they are deceiving themselves  Its like wandering about in a library where all the books are written in an indecipherable language  The only thing thats familiar is the color of the bindings  
      Are there no other planets like this  
      Its possible  This is the only one weve come across  In any case  its in an extremely rare category  not like Earth  Earth is a common type   the grass of the universe  And we pride ourselves on this universality  Theres nowhere we cant go  in that belief we set out for other worlds  all brimming with confidence  And what were we going to do with them  Rule them or be ruled by them  that was the only idea in our pathetic minds  What a useless waste       
     I got out of bed and fumbled in the medicine cabinet  My fingers recognized the shape of the big bottle of sleeping pills  and I turned around in the darkness 
      Im going to sleep  darling   Up in the ceiling  the ventilator hummed   I must get some sleep       
     In the morning  I woke up feeling calm and refreshed  The experiment seemed a petty matter  and I could not understand how I had managed to take the encephalogram so seriously  Nor was I much bothered by having to bring Rheya into the laboratory  In spite of all her exertions  she could not bear to stay out of sight and earshot for longer than five minutes  so I had abandoned my idea of further tests  she was even prepared to let herself be locked up somewhere   asked her to come with me  and advised her to bring something to read 
     I was especially curious about what I would find in the laboratory  There was nothing unusual about the appearance of the big  blue and white painted room  except that the shelves and cupboards meant to contain glass instruments seemed bare  The glass panel in one door was starred  and in some doors it was missing altogether  suggesting that there had been a struggle here recently  and that someone had done his best to remove the traces 
     Snow busied himself with the equipment  and behaved quite civilly  showing no surprise at the sight of Rheya  and greeting her with a quick nod of the head 
     I was lying down and Snow was swabbing my temples and forehead with saline solution  when a narrow door opened and Sartorius emerged from an unlighted room  He was wearing a white smock and a black anti radiation overall that came down to his ankles  and his greeting was authoritative and very professional in manner  We might have been two researchers in some great institute on Earth  continuing from where we had left off the day before  He was not wearing his dark glasses  but I noticed that he had on contact lenses  which I took to be the explanation of his lack of expression 
Satorius looked on with arms folded as Snow attached the electrodes and wrapped a bandage around my head  He looked around the room several times  ignoring Rheya  who sat on a stool with her back against the wall  pretending to read 
     Snow stepped back  and I moved my head  which was bulging with metal discs and wires  to watch him switch on  At this point Sartorius raised his hand and launched into a flowery speech 
      Dr  Kelvin  may I have your attention and concentration for a moment  I do not intend to dictate any precise sequence of thought to you  for that would invalidate the experiment  but I do insist that you cease thinking of yourself  of me  our colleague Snow  or anybody else  Make an effort to eliminate any intrusion of individual personalities  and concentrate on the matter in hand  Earth and Solaris  the body of scientists considered as a single entity  although generations succeed each other and man as an individual has a limited span  our aspirations  and our perseverance in the attempt to establish an intellectual contact  the long historic march of humanity  our own certitude of furthering that advance  and our determination to renounce all personal feelings in order to accomplish our mission  the sacrifices that we are prepared to make  and the hardships we stand ready to overcome       These are the themes that might properly occupy your awareness  The association of ideas does not depend entirely on your own will  However  the very fact of your presence here bears out the authenticity of the progression I have drawn to your attention  If you are unsure that you have acquitted yourself of your task  say so  I beg you  and our colleague Snow will make another recording  We have plenty of time  
     A dry little smile flickered over his face as he spoke these last words  but his expression remained morose  I was still trying to unravel the pompous phraseology which he had spun out with the utmost gravity  Snow broke the lengthening silence 
      Ready Kris  
     He was leaning with one elbow on the control panel of the electro encephalograph  looking completely relaxed  His confident tone reassured me  and I was grateful to him for calling me by my first name 
      Lets get started   I closed my eyes 
     A sudden panic had overwhelmed me after Snow had fixed the electrodes and walked over to the controls  now it disappeared just as suddenly  Through half closed lids  I could see the red lights winking on the black control panel  I was no longer aware of the damp  unpleasant touch of the crown of clammy electrodes  My mind was an empty grey arena ringed by a crowd of invisible onlookers massed on tiers of seats  attentive  silent  and emanating in their silence an ironic contempt for Sartorius and the Mission  What should I improvise for these spectators        Rheya       I introduced her name cautiously  ready to withdraw it at once  but no protest came  and I kept going  I was drunk with grief and tenderness  ready to suffer prolonged sacrifices patiently  My mind was pervaded with Rheya  without a body or a face  but alive inside me  real and imperceptible  Suddenly  as if printed over that despairing presence  I saw in the grey shadows the learned  professorial face of Giese  the father of Solarist studies and of Solarists  I was not visualizing the nauseating mud eruption which had swallowed up the gold rimmed spectacles and carefully brushed moustache  I was seeing the engraving on the title page of his classic work  and the close hatched strokes against which the artist had made his head stand out   so like my fathers  that head  not in its I features but in its expression of old fashioned wisdom and honesty  that I was finally no longer able to tell which of them was looking at me  my father or Giese  They were dead  and neither of them buried  but then deaths without burial are not uncommon in our time 
     The image of Giese vanished  and I momentarily forgot the Station  the experiment  Rheya and the ocean  Recent memories were obliterated by the overwhelming conviction that these two men  my father and Giese  nothing but ashes now  had once faced up to the totality of their existence  and this conviction afforded a profound calm which annihilated the formless assembly clustered around the grey arena in the expectation of my defeat 
     I heard the click of circuit breakers  and light penetrated my eyelids  which blinked open  Sartorius had not budged from his previous position  and was looking at me  Snow had his back turned to operate the control panel  I had the impression that he was amusing himself by making his sandals slap on the floor 
      Do you think that stage one has been successful  Dr  Kelvin   Sartorius inquired  in the nasal voice which I had come to detest 
      Yes  
      Are you sure   he persisted  obviously rather surprised  and perhaps even suspicious        Yes  
     My assurance and the bluntness of my answers made him lose his composure briefly 
      Oh       good   he stammered 
     Snow came over to me and started to unwrap the bandage from my head  Sartorius stepped back  hesitated  then disappeared into the dark room 
     I was rubbing the circulation back into my legs when he came out again  holding the developed film  Zigzag lines traced a lacy pattern along fifty feet of glistening black ribbon  My presence was no longer necessary  but I stayed  and Snow fed the ribbon into the modulator  Sartorius made a final suspicious examination of the last few feet of the spool  as if trying to decipher the content of the wavering lines 
     The experiment proceeded with a minimum of fuss 
     Snow and Sartorius each sat at a bank of controls and pushed buttons  Through the reinforced floor  I heard the whine of power building up in the turbines  Lights moved downward inside glass fronted indicators in time with the descent of the great X ray beamer to the bottom of its housing  They came to a stop at the low limit of the indicators 
     Snow stepped up the power  and the white needle of the voltmeter described a left toright semicircle  The hum of current was barely audible now  as the film unwound  invisible behind the two round caps  Numbers clicked through the footage indicator 
     I went over to Rheya  who was watching us over her book  She glanced up at me inquiringly  The experiment was over  and Sartorius was walking towards the heavy conical head of the machine 
      Can we go   Rheya mouthed silently 
     I replied with a nod  Rheya stood up and we left the room without taking leave of my colleagues 
     A superb sunset was blazing through the windows of the upper deck corridor  Usually the horizon was reddish and gloomy at this hour  This time it was a shimmering pink  laced with silver  Under the soft glow of the light  the somber foothills of the ocean shone pale violet  The sky was red only at the zenith 
     We came to the bottom of the stairway  and I stopped  reluctant to wall myself up again in the prison cell of the cabin 
      Rheya  I want to look something up in the library  Do you mind  
      Of course not   she exclaimed  in a forced attempt at cheerfulness   I can find something to read       
     I knew only too well that a gulf had opened between us since the previous day  I should have behaved more considerately  and tried to master my apathy  but I could not summon the strength 
     We walked down the ramp leading to the library  There were three doors giving onto the little entrance hall  and crystal globes containing flowers were spaced out along the walls  I opened the middle door  which was lined with synthetic leather on either side  I always avoided contact with this upholstery when entering the library  We were greeted by a pleasant gust of fresh air  In spite of the stylized sun painted on the ceiling  the great circular hall had remained cool 
     Idly running a finger along the spines of the books  I was on the point of choosing  out of all the Solarist classics  the first volume of Giese  so as to refresh my memory of the portrait on the title page  when I came upon a book I had not noticed before  an octavo volume with a cracked binding  It was Gravinskys  Compendium   used mostly by students  as a crib 
     Sitting in an armchair  with Rheya at my side  I leafed through Gravinskys alphabetical classification of the various Solarist theories  The compiler  who had never set foot on Solaris  had combed through every monograph  expedition report  fragmentary outline and provisional account  even making excerpts of incidental comments about Solaris in planetological works dealing with other worlds  He had drawn up an inventory crammed with simplistic formulations  which grossly diminished the subtlety of the ideas it resumed  Originally intended as an all embracing account  Gravinskys book was little more than a curiosity now  It had only been published twenty years before  but since that time such a mass of new theories had accumulated that there would not have been room for them in a single volume  I glanced through the index   practically an obituary list  for few of the authors cited were still alive  and among the survivors none was still playing an active part in Solarist studies  Reading all these names  and adding up the sum of the intellectual efforts they represented in every field of research  it was tempting to think that surely one of the theories quoted must be correct  and that the thousands of listed hypotheses must each contain some grain of truth  could not be totally unrelated to the reality 
     In his introduction  Gravinsky divided the first sixty years of Solarist studies into periods  During the initial period  which began with the scouting ship that studied the planet from orbit  nobody had produced theories in the strict sense  Common sense suggested that the ocean was a lifeless chemical conglomerate  a gelatinous mass which through its quasi volcanic activity produced marvellous creations and stabilized its eccentric orbit by virtue of a self generated mechanical process  as a pendulum keeps itself on a fixed path once it is set in motion  To be precise  Magenon had come up with the idea three years after the first expedition  but according to the  Compendium  the period of biological hypotheses does not begin until nine years later  when Magenons idea had acquired numerous supporters  The following years teemed with theoretical accounts of the living ocean  extremely complex  and supported by biomathematical analysis  During the third period  scientific opinion  hitherto practically unanimous  became divided 
     What followed was internecine warfare between scores of new schools of thought  It was the age of Panmaller  Strobel  Freyus  Le Greuille and Osipowicz  the entire legacy of Giese was submitted to a merciless examination  The first atlases and inventories appeared  and new techniques in remote control enabled instruments to transmit stereophotographs from the interior of the asymmetriads  once considered impossible to explore  In the hubbub of controversy  the minimal hypotheses were contemptuously dismissed  even if the long awaited contact with the reasoning monster did not materialize  it was argued that it was still worth investigating the cartilaginous cities of the mimoids and the ballooning mountains that rose above the ocean because we would gain valuable chemical and physio chemical information  and enlarge our understanding of the structure of giant molecules  Nobody bothered even to refute the adherents of this defeatist line of reasoning  Scientists devoted themselves to drawing up catalogues of the typical metamorphoses which are still standard works  and Frank developed his bioplasmatic theory of the mimoids  which has since been shown to be inaccurate  but remains a superb example of intellectual audacity and logical construction 
     The thirty or so years of the first three Gravinsky periods  with their open assurance and irresistibly optimistic romanticism  constitute the infancy of Solarist studies  Already a growing scepticism heralded the age of maturity  Towards the end of the first quarter century the early colloido mechanistic theories had found a distant descendant in the concept of the apsychic ocean  a new and almost unanimous orthodoxy which threw overboard the view of that entire generation of scientists who believed that their observations were evidence of a conscious will  teleological processes  and activity motivated by some inner need of the ocean  This point of view was now overwhelmingly repudiated  and the ground was cleared for the team headed by Holden  Ionides and Stoliva  whose lucid  analytically based speculations concentrated on scrupulous examination of a growing body of data  It was the golden age of the archivists  Microfilm libraries burst at the seams with documents  expeditions  some of them more than a thousand strong  were equipped with the most lavish apparatus Earth could provide   robot recorders  sonar and radar  and the entire range of spectrometers  radiation counters and so on  Material was being accumulated at an accelerating tempo  but the essential spirits of the research flagged  and in the course of this period  still an optimistic one in spite of everything  a decline set in 
     The first phase of Solaristics had been shaped by the personality of men like Giese  Strobel and Sevada  who had remained adventurous whether they were asserting or attacking a theoretical position  Sevada  the last of the great Solarists  disappeared near the south pole of the planet  and his death was never satisfactorily explained  He fell victim to a mistake which not even a novice would have made  Flying at low altitude  in full view of scores of observers  his aircraft had plunged into the interior of an agilus which was not even directly in its path  There was speculation about a sudden heart attack or fainting fit  or a mechanical failure  but I have always believed that this was in fact the first suicide  brought on by the first abrupt crisis of despair 
     There were other crises  not mentioned in Gravinsky  whose details I was able to fill in out of my own knowledge as I stared at the yellowed  closely printed pages 
     The later expressions of despair were in any case less dramatic  just as outstanding personalities became rarer  The recruitment of scientists to any particular field of study in a given age has never been studied as a phenomenon in its own right  Every generation throws up a fairly constant number of brilliant and determined men  the only difference lies in the direction they choose to take  The absence or presence of such individuals in a particular field of study is probably explicable in terms of the new perspectives offered  Opinions may differ about the researchers of the classical age of Solarist studies  but nobody can deny their stature  even their genius   For several decades  the mysterious ocean had attracted the best mathematicians and physicists  and the top specialists in biophysics  information theory and electro physiology  Now  without warning  the army of researchers found itself leaderless  There remained a faceless mass of industrious collectors and compilers  The occasional original experiment might be devised  but the succession of vast expeditions mounted on a worldwide scale petered out  and the scientific world no longer echoed with ambitious  controversial theories 
     The machinery of Solaristics fell into disrepair  and rusted over with hypotheses differentiated only in minor details  and unanimous in their concentration on the theme of the oceans degeneration  regression and introversion  Now and then a bolder  more interesting concept might emerge  but it always amounted to a kind of indictment of the ocean  viewed as the end product of a development which long ago  thousands of years before  had gone through a phase of superior organization  and now had nothing more than a physical unity  The argument went that its many useless  absurd creations were its death throes   impressive enough  nonetheless   which had been going on for centuries  Thus  for instance  the extensors and mimoids were seen as tumors  and all the surface processes of the huge fluid body as expressions of chaos and anarchy  This approach to the problem became an obsession  For seven or eight years  the academic literature produced a spate of assertions which although framed in polite  cautious terms  amounted to little more than insults  the revenge of a rabble of leaderless suitors when they realized that the object of their most pressing attentions was indifferent to the point of obstinately ignoring all their advances 
     A group of European psychologists once carried out a public opinion poll spread over a period of several years  Their report had no direct bearing on Solarist studies  and was not included in the library collection  but I had read it  and retained a clear memory of its findings  The investigators had strikingly demonstrated that the changes in lay opinion were closely correlated to the fluctuations of opinion recorded in scientific circles 
     That change was expressed even in the coordinating committee of the Institute of Planetology  which controls the financial appropriations for research  by means of a progressive reduction in the budgets of institutes and appointments devoted to Solarist studies  as well as by restrictions on the size of the exploration teams 
     Some scientists adopted a position at the other extreme  and agitated for more vigorous steps to be taken  The administrative director of the Universal Cosmological Institute ventured to assert that the living ocean did not despise men in the least  but had not noticed them  as an elephant neither feels nor sees the ants crawling on its back  To attract and hold the oceans attention  it would be necessary to devise more powerful stimuli  and gigantic machines tailored to the dimensions of the entire planet  Malicious commentators were not slow to point out that the director could well afford to be generous  since it was the Institute of Planetology which would have to foot the bill 
     Still the hypotheses rained down   old  resurrected hypotheses  superficially modified  simplified  or complicated to the extreme   and Solaristics  a relatively welldefined discipline in spite of its scope  became an increasingly tangled maze where every apparent exit led to a dead end  In the despondency  the ocean of Solaris was submerging under an ocean of printed paper 
     Two years before I began the stint in Gibarians laboratory which ended when I obtained the diploma of the Institute  the Mett Irving Foundation offered a huge prize to anybody who could find a viable method of tapping the energy of the ocean  The idea was not a new one  Several cargoes of the plasmatic jelly had been shipped back to Earth in the past  and various methods of preservation had been patiently tested  high and low temperatures  artificial micro atmospheres and micro climates  and prolonged irradiation  The whole gamut of physical and chemical processes had been run  only to end with the same outcome  a gradual process of decomposition which passed through well defined stages  starting with wasting  maceration  then first degree  primary  and late  secondary  liquefaction  The samples removed from the plasmatic growths and 
creations met with the same fate  with certain variations in the phases of decomposition  The end product was always a light metallic ash 
     Once the scientists recognized that it was impossible to keep alive  or even in a vegetative state  any fragment of the ocean  large or small  in dissociation from the entire organism  a growing tendency developed  under the influence of the MeunierProroch school  to isolate this problem as the key to the mystery  It was seen as a matter of interpretation   solve it  and the back of the problem would be broken 
     The quest for this key  the philosophers stone of Solarist studies  had absorbed the time and energy of all kinds of people with little or no scientific training  During the fourth decade of Solaristics the craze spread like an epidemic  and provided a fertile ground for the psychologists  An unknown number of cranks and ignorant fanatics toiled at their fumbling researches with a greater enthusiasm than any which had animated the old prophets of perpetual motion  or the squaring of the circle  The craze fizzled out in only a few years  and by the time I was ready to leave for Solaris it had vanished from the headlines and from conversation  and the ocean itself was practically forgotten by the public 
     I took care to replace the  Compendium  in its correct alphabetical position  and in doing so dislodged a slim pamphlet by Grastrom  one of the most eccentric authors in Solarist literature  I had read the pamphlet  which was dictated by the urge to understand what lies beyond the grasp of mankind  and aimed in particular against the individual  man  and the human species  It was the abstract  acidulous work of an autodidact who had previously made a series of unusual contributions to various marginal and rarefied branches of quantum physics  In this fifteen page booklet  his magnum opus    Grastrom set out to demonstrate that the most abstract achievements of science  the most advanced theories and victories of mathematics represented nothing more than a stumbling one  or two step progression from our rude  prehistoric  anthropomorphic understanding of the universe around us  He pointed out correspondences with the human body   the projections of our senses  the structure of our physical organization  and the physiological limitations of man   in the equations of the theory of relativity  the theorem of magnetic fields and the various unified field theories  Grastroms conclusion was that there neither was  nor could be  any question of contact between mankind and any nonhuman civilization  This broadside against humanity made no specific mention of the living ocean  but its constant presence and scornful  victorious silence could be felt between every line  at any rate such had been my own impression  It was Gibarian who drew it to my attention  and it must have been Gibarian who had added it to the Stations collection  on his own authority  since Grastroms pamphlet was regarded more as a curiosity than a true contribution to Solarist literature 
     With a strange feeling almost of respect  I carefully slid the slim pamphlet back into the crowded bookshelf  then stroked the green bronze binding of the Solaris Annual with my fingertips  In the space of a few days  we had unquestionably gained positive information about a number of basic questions  which had made seas of ink flow and fed innumerable controversies  yet had remained sterile for lack of arguments  Today the mystery practically had us under siege  and we had powerful arguments 
     Was the ocean a living creature  It could hardly be doubted any longer by any but lovers of paradox or obstinacy  It was no longer possible to deny the psychic functions of the ocean  no matter how that term might be defined  Certainly it was only too obvious that the ocean had noticed us  This fact alone invalidated that category of Solarist theories which claimed that the ocean was an introverted world  a hermit entity  deprived by a process of degeneration of the thinking organs it once possessed  unaware of the existence of external objects and events  the prisoner of a gigantic vortex of mental currents created and confined in the depths of this monster revolving between two suns 
     Not only that  we had discovered that the ocean was capable of reproducing what we ourselves had never succeeded in creating artificially   a perfect human body  modified in its sub atomic structure for purposes we could not guess 
     The ocean lived  thought and acted  The Solaris problem had not been annihilated by its very absurdity  We were truly dealing with a living creature  The lost faculty was not lost at all  All this now seemed proved beyond doubt  Like it or not  men must pay attention to this neighbor  light years away  but nevertheless a neighbor situated inside our sphere of expansion  and more disquieting than all the rest of the universe 
     Perhaps we had arrived at a turning point  What would the high level decision be  Would we be ordered to give up and return to Earth  immediately or in the near future  Was it even possible that we would be ordered to liquidate the Station  It was at least not improbable  But I did not favor the solution by retreat  The existence of the thinking colossus was bound to go on haunting mens minds  Even when man had explored every corner of the cosmos  and established relations with other civilizations founded by creatures similar to ourselves  Solaris would remain an eternal challenge 
     Misplaced among the thick volumes of the Annual  I discovered a small calf bound book  and scanned its scuffed  worn cover for a moment  It was Muntiuss  Introduction to Solaristics   published many years before  I had read it in a single night  after Gibarian had smilingly lent me his personal copy  and when I had turned the final page the light of a new Earth dawn was shining through my window  According to Muntius  Solaristics is the space eras equivalent of religion  faith disguised as science  Contact  the stated aim of Solaristics  is no less vague and obscure than the communion of the saints  or the second coming of the Messiah  Exploration is a liturgy using the language of methodology  the drudgery of the Solarists is carried out only in the expectation of fulfillment  of an Annunciation  for there are not and cannot be any bridges between Solaris and Earth  The comparison is reinforced by obvious parallels  Solarists reject arguments   no experiences in common  no communicable notions   just as the faithful rejected the arguments that undermined the foundations of their belief  Then again  what can mankind expect or hope for out of a joint pooling of information with the living ocean  A catalogue of the vicissitudes associated with an existence of such infinite duration that it probably has no memory of its origins  A description of the aspirations  passions and sufferings that find expression in the perpetual creation of living mountains  The apotheosis of mathematics  the revelation of plenitude in isolation and renunciation  But all this represents a body of incommunicable knowledge  Transposed into any human language  the values and meanings involved lose all substance  they cannot be brought intact through the barrier  In any case  the adepts do not expect such revelations   of the order of poetry  rather than science   since unconsciously it is Revelation itself that they expect  and this revelation is to explain to them the meaning of the destiny of man  Solaristics is a revival of longvanished myths  the expression of mystical nostalgias which men are unwilling to confess openly  The cornerstone is deeply entrenched in the foundations of the edifice  it is the hope of Redemption 
     Solarists are incapable of recognizing this truth  and consequently take care to avoid any interpretation of Contact  which is presented in their writings as an ultimate goal  whereas originally it had been considered as a beginning  and as a step onto a new path  among many other possible paths  Over the years  Contact has become sanctified  It has become the heaven of eternity 
     Muntius analyzes this heresy of planetology very simply and trenchantly  He brilliantly dismantles the Solarist myth  or rather the myth of the Mission of Mankind 
     Muntiuss had been the first voice raised in protest  and had encountered the contemptuous silence of the experts  at a time when they still retained a romantic confidence in the development of Solaristics  After all  how could they have accepted a thesis that struck at the foundations of their achievements 
     Solaristics went on waiting for the man who would reestablish it on a firm foundation and define its frontiers with precision  Five years after the death of Muntius  when his pamphlet had become a rare collectors piece  a group of Norwegian researchers founded a school named after him   In contact with the personalities of his various spiritual heirs  the quiet thought of the master went through profound transformations  it led to the corrosive irony of Erie Ennesson and  on a more mundane plane  the utilitarian or utilitarianistic Solaristics of Fa leng  who argued that science should settle for the immediate advantages offered by exploration  and not concern itself with any intellectual communion of two civilizations  or some illusory contact  Compared with the ruthless  lucid analysis of Muntius  the works of his disciples are hardly more than compilations and sometimes vulgarizations  with the exception of Ennessons essays and perhaps the studies of Takata  Muntius himself had already defined the complete development of Solarist concepts  He called the first phase the era of the prophets  among whom he included Giese  Holden and Sevada  the second  the great schism   the fragmentation of the one Solarist church into a number of waning sects  and he anticipated a third phase  which would set in when there was nothing left to investigate  and manifest itself in a crabbed  academic dogmatism  This prophecy was to prove inaccurate  however  In my opinion  Gibarian was right to characterize Muntiuss strictures as a monumental simplification which ignored all the aspects of Solarist studies that had nothing in common with a creed  since the work of interpretation based itself only on the concrete evidence of a globe orbiting two suns 
     Slipped between two pages of Muntiuss pamphlet  I discovered an off print of the quarterly review  Parerga Solariana   which turned out to be one of the first articles written by Gibarian  even before he was appointed director of the Institute  The article was called  Why I Am a Solarist  and began with a concise account of all the material phenomena which confirmed the possibility of contact  Gibarian belonged to that generation of researchers who had been daring and optimistic enough to hark back to the golden age  and who did not disown their own version of a faith that overstepped the frontiers imposed by science  and yet remained concrete  since it pre supposed the success of perseverance 
     Gibarian had been influenced by the classical work in bio electronics for which the Eurasian school of Cho En min  Ngyalla and Kawakadze is famous  Their studies established an analogy between the charted electrical activity of the brain and certain discharges occurring deep in the plasma before the appearance  for example  of elementary polymorphs or twin solarids  Gibarian was opposed to anthropomorphizing interpretations  and the mystifications of the psychoanalytic  psychiatric and neurophysiological schools which attempted to endow the ocean with the symptoms of human illnesses  epilepsy among them  supposed to correspond with the spasmodic eruptions of the asymmetriads   He was one of the most cautious and logical proponents of Contact  and saw no advantage in the kind of sensationalism which was in any case becoming more and more rare as applied to Solaris 
     My own doctoral thesis received a fair amount of attention  not all of it welcome  It was based on the discoveries of Bergmann and Reynolds  who had succeeded in isolating and filtering the elements of the most powerful emotions   despair  grief and pleasure   out of the mass of general mental processes  Systematically comparing their recordings with the electrical discharges from the ocean  I had observed oscillations in certain parts of symmetriads and at the bases of nascent mimoids which were sufficiently analogous to deserve further investigation  The journalists pounced on my thesis  and in some newspapers my name was coupled with grotesque headlines   The Despairing Jelly  The Planet in Orgasm  But this dubious fame did have the fortunate consequence  or so I had thought a few days previously  of attracting the attention of Gibarian  who naturally could not read every new publication dealing with Solaris  The letter he sent me ended a chapter of my life  and began a new one
