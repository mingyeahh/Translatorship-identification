 the following morning  i received another note from snow  sartorius had left off working on the disruptor and was getting ready for a final experiment with high power x rays 
      rheya  darling  i have to pay a visit to snow  
     the red dawn blazing through the window divided the room in two  we were in an area of blue shadow  everything outside this shadow zone was burnished copper  if a book had fallen from a shelf  my ear would have listened instinctively for a metallic clang 
      its to do with the experiment  only i dont know what to do about it  please understand  id rather       
      you neednt justify yourself  kris  if only it doesnt go on too long  
      its bound to take a while  look  do you think you could wait in the corridor  
      i can try  but what if i lose control  
      what does it feel like  im not asking just out of curiosity  believe me  but if we can discuss how it works you might find some way of keeping it in check  
     rheya had turned pale  but she tried to explain 
      i feel afraid  not of some thing or some person   theres no focus  only a sense of being lost  and i am terribly ashamed of myself  then  when you come back  it stops  thats what made me think i might have been ill  
      perhaps its only inside this damned station that it works  ill make arrangements for us to get out as soon as possible  
      do you think you can  
      why not  im not a prisoner here  ill have to talk it over with snow  have you any idea how long you could manage to remain by yourself  
      that depends       if i could hear your voice  i think might be able to hold out  
      id rather you werent listening  not that i have anything to hide  but theres no telling what snow might say  
      you neednt go on  i understand  ill just stand close enough to hear the sound of your voice  
      im going to the operating room to phone him  the doors will be open        rheya nodded agreement 
     i crossed the red zone  the corridor seemed dark by contrast  in spite of the lighting  inside the open door of the operating room  fragments of the dewar bottle  the last traces of the previous nights events  gleamed from under a row of liquid oxygen containers  when i took the phone off the hook  the little screen lit up  and i tapped out the number of the radio cabin  behind the dull glass  a spot of bluish light grew  burst  and snow was looking at me perched on the edge of his chair 
      i got your note and i want to talk to you  can i come over  
      yes  right away  
      yes  
      excuse me  but are you coming alone or accompanied  
      alone  
     his creased forehead and thin  tanned face filled the screen as he leant forward to scrutinize me through the convex glass  then he appeared to reach an abrupt decision 
      fine  fine  ill be expecting you  
     i went back to the cabin  where i could barely make the shape of rheya behind the curtain of red sunlight  she was sitting in an armchair  with her hands clutching the armrests  she must have failed to hear my footsteps  and i saw her for a moment fighting the inexplicable compulsion that possessed her and wrestling with the fierce contractions of her entire body which stopped immediately she saw me  i choked back a feeling of blind rage and pity 
     we walked in silence down the long corridor with its polychromed walls  the designers had intended the variations in color to make life more tolerable inside the armored shell of the station  a shaft of red light ahead of us meant that the door of the radio cabin was ajar  and i looked at rheya  she made no attempt to return my smile  totally absorbed in her preparations for the coming battle with herself  now that the ordeal was about to begin  her face was pinched and white  fifteen paces from the door  she stopped  pushing me forward gently with her fingertips as i started to turn around  suddenly i felt that snow  the experiment  even the station itself were not worth the agonizing price that rheya was ready to pay  with myself as assistant torturer  i would have retraced my steps  but a shadow fell across the cabin doorway  and i hurried inside 
     snow stood facing me with the red sun behind him making a halo of purple light out of his grey hair  we confronted one another without speaking  and he was able to examine me at his leisure in the sunlight that dazzled me so that i could hardly see him 
     i walked past him and leaned against a tall desk bristling with microphones on their flexible stalks  snow pivoted slowly and went on staring at me with his habitual cheerless smile  in which there was no amusement  only overpowering fatigue  still with his eyes on mine  he picked his way through the piles of objects littered about the cabin   thermic cells  instruments  spare parts for the electronic equipment   pulled a stool up against the door of a steel cabinet  and sat down 
     i listened anxiously  but no sound came from the corridor  why did snow not speak  the prolonged silence was becoming exasperating 
     i cleared my throat 
      when will you and sartorius be ready  
      we can start today  but the recording will take some time  
      recording  you mean the encephalogram   
      yes  you agreed  is anything wrong   
      no  nothing  
     another lengthening silence  snow broke it   did you have something to tell me         she knows   i whispered 
     he frowned  but i had the impression that he was not really surprised  then why pretend  i lost all desire to confide in him  all the same  i had to be honest 
      she started to suspect after our meeting in the library  my behavior  various other indications  then she found gibarians tape recorder and played back the tape  
     snow sat intent and unmoving  standing by the desk  my view of the corridor was blocked by the half open door  i lowered my voice again 
      last night  while i was asleep  she tried to kill herself  she drank liquid oxygen        there was a sound of rustling  like papers stirred by the wind  i stopped and listened for something in the corridor  but the noise did not come from there  a mouse in the cabin  out of the question  this was solaris  i stole a glance at snow   go on   he said calmly 
      it didnt work  of course  anyway  she knows who she is  
      why tell me  
     i was taken aback for an instant  then i stammered out   so as to inform you  to keep you up to date on the situation       
      i warned you  
      you mean you knew   my voice rose involuntarily  
      what you have just told me  of course not  but 1 explained the position  when it arrives  the visitor is almost blank   only a ghost made up of memories and vague images dredged out of its       source  the longer it stays with you  the more human it becomes  it also becomes more independent  up to a certain point  and the longer that goes on  the more difficult it gets        snow broke off  looked me up and down  and went on reluctantly   does she know everything  
      yes  ive just told you  
      everything  does she know that she came once before  and that you              no  
      listen kelvin   he smiled ruefully   if thats how it is  what do you want to do   leave the station         yes  
      with her  
     the silence while he considered his reply also revealed something else  again  from somewhere close  and without being able to pin it down  i heard the same faint rustling in the cabin  as if through a thin partition 
     snow shifted on his stool 
      all right  why look at me like that  do you think i would stand in your way  you can do as you like  kelvin  were in enough trouble already without putting pressure on each other  i know it will be a hopeless job to convince you  but theres something i have to say  you are doing all you can to stay human in an inhuman situation  noble it may be  but it isnt going to get you anywhere  and im not so sure about it being noble   not if its idiotic at the same time  but thats your affair  lets get back to the point  you renege on the experiment and take her away with you  has it struck you that youll only be embarking on a different kind of experiment  
      what do you mean  if you want to know whether she can manage it  as long as im with her  i dont see        i trailed to a halt 
     snow sighed 
      all of us have our heads in the sand  kelvin  and we know it  theres no need to put on airs  
      im not putting anything on  
      im sorry  i didnt want to offend you  i take back the airs  but i still think that you are playing the ostrich game   and a particularly dangerous version  you deceive yourself  you deceive her  and you chase your own tail  do you know the necessary conditions for stabilizing a neutrino field  
      no  nor do you  nor does anyone  
      exactly  all we know is that the structure is inherently unstable  and can only be maintained by means of a continuous energy input  sartorius told me that  this energy creates a rotating stabilization field  now  does that energy come from outside the visitor  or is it generated internally  you see the difference  
      yes  if it is external  she       
     snow finished the sentence for me 
      away from solaris  the structure disintegrates  its only a theory  of course  but one that you can verify  since you have already set up an experiment  the vehicle you launched is still in orbit  in my spare moments  ive even calculated its trajectory  you can take off  intercept  and find out what happened to the passenger       
      youre out of your mind   i yelled 
      you think so  and what if we brought the shuttle down again  no problem   its on remote control  well bring it out of orbit  and       
      shut up  
      that wont do either  theres another method  a very simple one  it doesnt involve bringing the shuttle down  only establishing radio contact  if shes alive  shell reply  and       
      the oxygen would have run out days ago  
      she may not need it  shall we try  
      snow       snow       
     he mimicked my intonation angrily 
      kelvin       kelvin       think  just a little  are you a man or not  who are you trying to please  who do you want to save  yourself  her  and which version of her  this one or that one  havent you got the guts to face them both  surely you realize that you havent thought it through  let me tell you one last time  we are in a situation that is beyond morality  
     the rustling noise returned  and this time it sounded like nails scraping on a wall  all at once i was filled with a dull indifference  i saw myself  i saw both of us  from a long way off  as if through the wrong end of a telescope  and everything looked meaningless  trivial  and slightly ridiculous 
      so what do you suggest  send up another shuttle  she would be back tomorrow  and the day after  and the day after that  how long do you want it to go on  whats the good of disposing of her if she keeps returning  how would it help me  or you  or sartorius  or the station  
      no  heres my suggestion  leave with her  youll witness the transformation  after a few minutes  youll see       
      what  a monster  a demon  
      no  youll see her die  thats all  dont think that they are immortal   i promise you that they die  and then what will you do  come back       for a fresh sample   he stared at me with bantering condescension 
      thats enough   i burst out  clenching my fists 
      oh  im the one who has to be quiet  look  i didnt start this conversation  and as far as im concerned it has gone on long enough  let me just suggest some ways for you to amuse yourself  you could scourge the ocean with rods  for instance  youve got it into your head that youre a traitor if you        he waved his hand in farewell  and raised his head as if to watch an imaginary ship in flight         and a good man if you keep her  smiling when you feel like screaming  and shamming cheerful when you want to beat your head against a wall  isnt that being a traitor  what if it is not possible  here  to be anything but a traitor  what will you do  take it out on that bastard snow  who is the cause of it all  in that case  kelvin  you just put the lid on the rest of your troubles by acting like a complete idiot  
      you are talking from your own point of view  i love this girl  
      her memory  you mean  
      no  herself  i told you what she tried to do  how many real human beings could have that much courage  
      so you admit       
      dont quibble  
      right  so she loves you  and you want to love her  it isnt the same thing  
      youre wrong  
      im sorry  kelvin  but it was your idea to spill all this  you dont love her  you do love her  she is willing to give her life  so are you  its touching  its magnificent  anything you like  but its out of place here   its the wrong setting  dont you see  no  you dont want to  you are going around in circles to satisfy the curiosity of a power we dont understand and cant control  and she is an aspect  a periodic manifestation of that power  if she was       if you were being pestered by some infatuated hag  you wouldnt think twice about packing her off  right  
      i suppose so  
      well then  that probably explains why she is not a hag  you feel as if your hands are tied  thats just it  they are  
      all you are doing is adding one more theory to the millions of theories in the library  leave me alone snow  she is       no  i wont say any more  
      its up to you  but remember that she is a mirror that reflects a part of your mind  if she is beautiful  its because your memories are  you provide the formula  you can only finish where you started  dont forget that  
      what do you expect me to do  send her away  ive already asked you why  and you dont answer  
      ill give you an answer  it was you who wanted this conversation  not me  i havent meddled with your affairs  and im not telling you what to do or what not to do  even if i had the right  i would not  you come here of your own free will  and you dump it all on me  you know why  to take the weight off your own back  well ive experienced that weight   dont try to shut me up   and i leave you free to find your own solution  but you  want  opposition  if i got in your way  you could fight me  something tangible  a man just like you  with the same flesh and blood  fight me  and you could feel that you too were a man  when i dont give you the excuse to fight  you quarrel with me  or rather with yourself  the one thing youve left out is telling me youd die of grief if  she  suddenly disappeared       no  please  ive heard enough  
i countered clumsily 
      i came to tell you  because i thought you ought to know  that i intend leaving the station with her  
      still on the same tack   snow shrugged   i only offered my opinion because i realized that you were losing touch with reality  and the further you go  the harder you fall  can you come and see sartorius around nine tomorrow morning  
      sartorius  i thought he wasnt letting anybody in  you told me you couldnt even phone him  
      he seems to have reached some land of settlement  we never discuss our domestic troubles  with you  its another matter  will you come tomorrow morning  
      all right   i grunted 
     i noticed that snow had slipped his left hand inside the cabinet  how long had the door been ajar  probably for some time  but in the heat of the encounter i had not registered that the position of his hand was not natural  it was as if he was concealing something   or holding somebodys hand 
     i licked my lips 
      snow  what have you       
      youd better leave now   he said evenly 
     i closed the door in the final glow of the red twilight  rheya was huddled against the wall a few paces down the corridor  she sprang to her feet at once 
      you see  i did it  kris  i feel so much better       perhaps it will be easier and easier       
      yes  of course        i answered absently 
     we went back to my quarters  i was still speculating about that cabinet  and what had been hiding there  perhaps overhearing our entire conversation  my cheeks started to burn so hard that i involuntarily passed the back of my hand over them  what an idiotic meeting  and where did it get us  nowhere  but there was tomorrow morning
     an abrupt thrill of fear ran through me  my encephalogram  a complete record of the workings of my brain  was to be beamed into the ocean in the form of radiation  what was it snow had said   would i suffer terribly if rheya departed  an encephalogram records every mental process  conscious and unconscious  if i want her to disappear  will it happen  but if i wanted to get rid of her would i also be appalled at the thought of her imminent destruction  am i responsible for my unconscious  no one else is  if not myself  how stupid to agree to let them do it  obviously i can examine the recording before it is used  but i wont be able to decode it  nobody could  the experts can only identify general mental tendencies  for instance  they will say that the subject is thinking about some mathematical problem  but they are unable to specify its precise terms  they claim that they have to stick to generalizations because the encephalogram cannot discriminate among the stream of simultaneous impulses  only some of which have any psychological  counterpart   and they refuse point blank to hazard any comment on the unconscious processes  so how could they be expected to decipher memories which have been more or less repressed 
     then why was i so afraid  i had told rheya only that morning that the experiment could not work  if terran neurophysiologists were incapable of decoding the recording  what chance was there for that great alien creature        
     yet it had infiltrated my mind without my knowledge  surveyed my memory  and laid bare my most vulnerable point  that was undeniable  without any assistance or radiation transmissions  it had found its way through the armored shell of the station  located me  and come away with its spoils      
      kris   rheya whispered 
     standing at the window with unseeing eyes  i had not noticed the coming of darkness  a thin veiling of high cloud glowed a dim silver in the light of the vanished sun  and obscured the stars 
     if she disappears after the experiment  that will mean that i wanted her to disappear   that i killed her  no  i will not see sartorius  they cant force me to cooperate  but i cant tell them the truth  ill have to dissemble and lie  and keep on doing it       because there may be thoughts  intentions and cruel hopes in my mind of which i know nothing  because i am a murderer unawares  man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers  and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed  was i to abandon rheya there out of false shame  or because i lacked the courage 
      kris   said rheya  more softly still 
she was standing quite close to me now  i pretended not to hear  at that moment  i wanted to isolate myself  i had not yet resolved anything  or reached any decision  i stood motionless  looking at the dark sky and the cold stars  pale ghosts of the stars that shone on earth  my mind was a blank  all i had was the grim certainty of having crossed some point of no return  i refused to admit that i was travelling towards what i could not reach  apathy robbed me of the strength even to despise myself
