at 19 00 hours  ships time  i made my way to the launching bay  the men around the shaft stood aside to let me pass  and i climbed down into the capsule 
     inside the narrow cockpit  there was scarcely room to move  i attached the hose to the valve on my spacesuit and it inflated rapidly  from then on  i was incapable of making the smallest movement  there i stood  or rather hung suspended  enveloped in my pneumatic suit and yoke to the metal hull 
     i looked up  through the transparent canopy i could see a smooth  polished wall and  far above  moddards head leaning over the top of the shaft  he vanished  and suddenly i was plunged in darkness  the heavy protective cone had been lowered into place  eight times i heard the hum of the electric motors which turned the screws  followed by the hiss of the shock absorbers  as my eyes grew accustomed to the dark  i could see the luminous circle of the solitary dial 
     a voice echoed in my headphones 
      ready    
      ready  moddard   i answered 
      dont worry about a thing  the station will pick you up in flight  have a good trip  
     there was a grinding noise and the capsule swayed  my muscles tensed in spite of myself  but there was no further noise or movement 
      when is lift off   as i asked  i noticed a rustling outside  like a shower of fine sand      youre on your way     good luck   moddards voice sounded as close as before 
     a wide slit opened at eye level  and i could see the stars  the  prometheus  was orbiting in the region of alpha in aquarius and i tried in vain to orient myself  a glittering dust filled my porthole  i could not recognize a single constellation  in this region of the galaxy the sky was unfamiliar to me  i waited for the moment when i would pass near the first distinct star  but i was unable to isolate any one of them  their brightness was fading  they receded  merging into a vague  purplish glimmer  the sole indication of the distance i had already travelled  my body rigid  sealed in its pneumatic envelope  i was knifing through space with the impression of standing still in the void  my only distraction the steadily mounting heat 
     suddenly  there was a shrill  grating sound  like a steel blade being drawn across a sheet of wet glass  this was it  the descent  if i had not seen the figures racing across the dial  i would not have noticed the change in direction  the stars having vanished long since  my gaze was swallowed up on the pale reddish glow of infinity  i could hear my heart thudding heavily  i could feel the coolness from the air conditioning on my neck  although my face seemed to be on fire  i regretted not having caught a glimpse of the  prometheus   but the ship must have been out of sight by the time the automatic controls had raised the shutter of my porthole 
     the capsule was shaken by a sudden jolt  then another  the whole vehicle began to vibrate  filtered through the insulating layers of the outer skins  penetrating my pneumatic cocoon  the vibration reached me  and ran through my entire body  the image of the dial shivered and multiplied  and its phosphorescence spread out in all directions  i felt no fear  i had not undertaken this long voyage only to overshoot my target 
     i called into the microphone 
      station solaris  station solaris  station solaris  i think i am leaving the flight path  correct my course  station solaris  this is the  prometheus  capsule  over  
     i had missed the precious moment when the planet first came into view  now it was spread out before my eyes  flat  and already immense  nevertheless  from the appearance of its surface  i judged that i was still at a great height above it  since i had passed that imperceptible frontier after which we measure the distance that separates us from a celestial body in terms of altitude  i was falling  now i had the sensation of falling  even with my eyes closed   i quickly reopened them  i did not want to miss anything there was to be seen  
    i waited a moment in silence before trying once more to make contact  no response  successive bursts of static came through the headphones  against a background of deep  low pitched murmuring  which seemed to me the very voice of the planet itself  a veil of mist covered the orange colored sky  obscuring the porthole  instinctively  i hunched myself up as much as my inflated suit would allow  but almost at once i realized that i was passing through cloud  then  as though sucked upwards  the cloud mass lifted  i was gliding  half in light  half in shadow  the capsule revolving upon its own vertical axis  at last  through the porthole  the gigantic ball of the sun appeared  looming up on the left and disappearing to the right 
     a distant voice reached me through the murmuring and crackling 
      station solaris calling  station solaris calling  the capsule will land at zero hour  i repeat  the capsule will land at zero hour  stand by for count down  two hundred and fifty  two hundred and forty nine  two hundred and forty eight       
     the words were punctuated by sharp screeching sounds  automatic equipment was intoning the phrases of the reception drill  this was surprising  to say the least  as a rule  men on space stations were eager to greet a newcomer  especially if he was arriving direct from earth  i did not have long to ponder this  for the suns orbit  which had so far encircled me  shifted unexpectedly  and the incandescent disc appeared now to the right  now to the left  seeming to dance on the planets horizon  i was swinging like a giant pendulum while the planet  its surface wrinkled with purplish blue and black furrows  rose up in front of me like a wall  as my head began to spin  i caught sight of a tiny pattern of green and white dots  it was the stations positioning marker  something detached itself with a snap from the cone of the capsule  with a fierce jerk  the long parachute collar released its hoops  and the noise which followed reminded me irresistibly of earth  for the first time after so many months  the moaning of the wind 
     everything went quickly after this  so far  i had known that i must be falling  now i could see it for myself  the green and white checker board grew rapidly larger and i could see that it was painted on an elongated silvery body  shaped like a whale  its flanks bristling with radar antennae  this metal colossus  which was pierced with several rows of shadowy apertures  was not resting on the planet itself but suspended above it  casting upon the inky surface beneath an ellipsoidal shadow of even deeper blackness  i could make out the slate colored ripples of the ocean  stirring with a faint motion  suddenly  the clouds rose to a great height  rimmed with a blinding crimson glare  the lurid sky became grey  distant and flat  everything was blotted out  i was falling in a spin 
     a sharp jolt  and the capsule righted itself  through the porthole  i could see the ocean once more  the waves like crests of glittering quicksilver  the hoops of the parachute  their cords snapped  flapped furiously over the waves  carried on the wind  the capsule gently descended  swaying with a peculiar slow motion rhythm imposed on it by the artificial magnetic field  there was just time to glimpse the launchingpads and the parabolic reflectors of two radio telescopes on top of their pierced steel towers 
     with the clang of steel rebounding against steel  the capsule came to a stop  a hatch opened  and with a long  harsh sigh  the metal shell which imprisoned me reached the end of its voyage 
     i heard the mechanical voice from the control center 
      station solaris  zero and zero  the capsule has landed  out  
     feeling a vague pressure on my chest and a disagreeable heaviness in the pit of my stomach  i seized the control levers with both hands and cut the contacts  a green indicator lit up  arrival  the capsule opened  and the pneumatic padding shoved me gently from behind  so that  in order to keep my balance  i had to take a step forward 
     with a muffled sigh of resignation  the spacesuit expelled its air  i was free 
     i found myself inside a vast  silver funnel  as high as a cathedral nave  a cluster of colored pipes ran down the sloping walls and disappeared into rounded orifices  i turned round  the ventilation shafts were roaring  sucking in the poisonous gases from the planets atmosphere which had infiltrated when my capsule had landed inside the station  empty  resembling a burst cocoon  the cigar shaped capsule stood upright  enfolded by a calyx mounted on a steel base  the outer casing  scorched during flight  had turned a dirty brown 
     i went down a small stairway  the metal floor below had been coated with a heavyduty plastic  in places  the wheels of trolleys carrying rockets had worn through this plastic covering to expose the bare steel beneath 
     the throbbing of the ventilators ceased abruptly and there was total silence  i looked around me  a little uncertain  waiting for someone to appear  but there was no sign of life  only a neon arrow glowed  pointing towards a moving walkway which was silently unreeling  i allowed myself to be carried forward 
     the ceiling of the hall descended in a fine parabolic arc until it reached the entrance to a gallery  in whose recesses gas cylinders  gauges  parachutes  crates and a quantity of other objects were scattered about in untidy heaps 
     the moving walkway set me down at the far end of the gallery  on the threshold of a dome  here there was an even greater disorder  a pool of oily liquid spread out from beneath a pile of oil drams  a nauseating smell hung in the air  footprints  in a series of glutinous smears  went off in all directions  the oil drums were covered with a tangle of tickertape  torn paper and other waste 
     another green arrow directed me to the central door  behind this stretched a narrow corridor  hardly wide enough for two men to walk side by side  lit by slabs of glass let into the ceiling  then another door  painted in green and white squares  which was ajar  i went in 
     the cabin had concave walls and a big panoramic window  which a glowing mist had tinged with purple  outside the murky waves slid silently past  open cupboards lined the walls  filled with instruments  books  dirty glasses  vacuum flasks   all covered with dust  five or six small trolleys and some collapsible chairs cluttered up the stained floor  one chair alone was inflated  its back raised  in this armchair there was a little thin man  his face burnt by the sun  the skin on his nose and cheeks coming away in large flakes  i recognized him as snow  a cybernetics expert and  s deputy  in his time he had published articles of great originality in the solarist annual  it so happened that i had never had the opportunity of meeting him  he was wearing a mesh shirt which allowed the grey hairs of his sunken chest to poke through here and there  and canvas trousers with a great many pockets  mechanics trousers  which had once been white but now were stained at the knees and covered with holes from chemical burns  he was holding one of those pear shaped plastic flasks which are used in spaceships not equipped with internal gravitational systems  snows eyes widened in amazement as he looked up and saw me  the flask dropped from his fingers and bounced several times  spilling a few drops of transparent liquid  blood drained from his face  i was too astonished to speak  and this dumbshow continued for so long that snows terror gradually communicated itself to me  i took a step forward  he cringed in his chair 
      snow   
     he quivered as though i had struck him  gazing at me in indescribable horror  he gasped out 
      i dont know        his voice croaked   i dont know you       what do you want  
     the spilt liquid was quickly evaporating  i caught a whiff of alcohol  had he been drinking  was he drunk  what was he so terrified of  i stood in the middle of the room  my legs were trembling  my ears roared  as though they were stuffed with cotton wool  i had the impression that the ground was giving way beneath my feet  beyond the curved window  the ocean rose and fell with regularity  snows blood shot eyes never left me  his terror seemed to have abated  but his expression of invincible disgust remained   whats the matter  are you ill   i whispered 
      you seem worried   he said  his voice hollow   you actually seem worried       so its like that now  is it  but why concern yourself about me  i dont know you  
      wheres     i asked 
     he gave a gasp and his glassy eyes lit up for an instant 
      gi       giba       no  no  
     his whole frame shook with stifled  hysterical laughter  then he seemed to calm down a little 
      so its   youve come for  is it  poor old    what do you want with him   his words  or rather his tone of voice  expressed hatred and defiance  it was as though i had suddenly ceased to represent a threat to him 
     bewildered  i mumbled   what       where is he  
      dont you know  
     obviously he was drunk and raving  my anger rose  i should have controlled myself and left the room  but i had lost patience  i shouted 
      thats enough  how could i know where he is since ive only just arrived  snow  whats going on here   his jaw dropped  once again he caught his breath and his eyes gleamed with a different light  he seized the arms of his chair with both hands and stood up with difficulty  his knees were trembling 
      what  youve just arrived       where have you come from   he asked  almost sober 
      from earth   i retorted angrily   maybe youve heard of it  not that anyone would ever guess it  
      from earth  good god  then you must be    
      of course  why are you looking at me like that  whats so startling about me   
   he blinked rapidly 
    nothing   he said  wiping his forehead   nothing  forgive me     its nothing  i assure you  i was simply surprised  i didnt expect to see you  
       what do you mean  you didnt expect to see me  you were notified months ago  and moddard radioed only today from the  prometheus   
      yes  yes  indeed  only  you see  were a bit disorganized at the moment  
      so i see   i answered dryly 
     snow walked around me  inspecting my atmosphere suit  which was standard issue with the usual harness of wires and cables attached to the chest  he coughed  and rubbed his bony nose 
      perhaps you would like a bath  it would do you good  its the blue door  on the other side  
      thanks   i know the station lay out  
      you must be hungry  
      no  wheres    
     without answering  he went over to the window  from behind he looked considerably older  his close cropped hair was grey  and deep wrinkles creased his sunburnt neck 
      the wave crests glinted through the window  the colossal rollers rising and falling in slow motion  watching the ocean like this one had the illusion   it was surely an illusion   that the station was moving imperceptibly  as though teetering on an invisible base  then it would seem to recover its equilibrium  only to lean the opposite way with the same lazy movement  thick foam  the color of blood  gathered in the troughs of the waves  for a fraction of a second  my throat tightened and i thought longingly of the  prometheus  and its strict discipline  the memory of an existence which suddenly seemed a happy one  now gone forever 
     snow turned around  nervously rubbing his hands together 
      listen   he said abruptly   except for me theres no one around for the moment  youll have to make do with my company for today  call me ratface  dont argue  you know me by my photograph  just imagine were old friends  everyone calls me ratface  theres nothing i can do about it  
   obstinately  i repeated my question        where is    
     he blinked again 
      im sorry to have received you like that  its       its not exactly my fault  i had completely forgotten       a lot has been happening here  you see       
      its all right  but what about    isnt he on the station  is he on an observation flight  
     snow was gazing at a tangled mass of cables 
      no  he hasnt left the station  and he wont be flying  the fact is         
     my ears were still blocked  and i was finding it more and more difficult to hear 
      what  what do you mean  where is he then  
      i should think you might guess   he answered in a changed voice  looking me coldly in the eyes  i shivered  he was drunk  but he knew what he was saying 
      theres been an accident  
     he nodded vigorously  watching my reactions closely 
      when  
      this morning  at dawn  
     by now  my sensations were less violent  this succinct exchange of questions and answers had calmed me  i was beginning to understand snows strange behavior 
      what kind of accident  
      why not go to your cabin and take off your spacesuit  come back in  say  an hours time  
   i hesitated 
 all right   i said finally 
     as i made to leave  he called me back 
      wait   he had an uneasy look  as if he wanted to add something but was finding it difficult to bring out the words  after a pause  he said 
      there used to be three of us here  now  with you  there are three of us again  do you know    
      in the same way as i knew you   only from his photographs  
      hes up there  in the laboratory  and i doubt if hell come down before dark  but       in any case  youll recognize him  if you should see anyone else   someone who isnt me or    you understand  then       
      then what  
     i must be dreaming  all this could only be a dream  the inky waves  their crimson gleams under the low hanging sun  and this little man who had gone back to his armchair  sitting there as before  hanging his head and staring at the heap of cables 
      in that case  do nothing  
      who could i see   i flared up   a ghost  
      you think im mad  of course  no  no  im not mad  i cant say anything more for the moment  perhaps       who knows        nothing will happen  but dont forget i warned you  
      dont be so mysterious  whats all this about       
      keep a hold on yourself  be prepared to meet       anything  it sounds impossible i know  but try  its the only advice i can give you  i cant think of anything better  
      but what could i possibly meet   i shouted 
     seeing him sitting there  looking sideways at me  his sunburnt face drooping with fatigue  i found it difficult to contain myself  i wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake him 
     painfully  dragging the words out one by one  he answered 
 i dont know  in a way  it depends on you  
      hallucinations  you mean  
      no       its real enough  dont attack  whatever you do  remember that  
      what are you getting at   i could hardly recognize the sound of my own voice 
      were not on earth  you know  
      a polytherian form   i shouted   theres nothing human about them  
     i was about to rush at him  to drag him out of the trance  prompted  apparently  by his crazy theories  when he murmured 
      thats why theyre so dangerous  remember what ive told you  and be on your guard  
      what happened to    
     he did not answer 
      what is   doing  
      come back in an hour  
     i turned and went out  as i closed the door behind me  i took a last look at him  tiny  shrunken  his head in his hands and his elbows resting on his stained knees  he sat there  motionless  it was only then that i noticed the dried bloodstains on the backs of his hands
