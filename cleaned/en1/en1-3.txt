i hastily pocketed gibarians notes and went over to the locker  work suits and clothes had been pushed to one side as though someone had hidden himself at the back  on the floor i saw the corner of an envelope sticking out from a heap of papers and picked it up  it was addressed to me  dry mouthed with apprehension  i tore it open  i had to force myself to unfold the note inside 
     in his even handwriting  small but perfectly legible  gibarian had written two lines 
      supplement dir  solar  vol 1   vot  separat  
      messenger ds aff  f   ravintzer  the little apocrypha  
     that was all  not another word  did these two lines contain some vital piece of information  when had he written them  i told myself that the first thing to do was to consult the library index  i knew the supplement to the first volume of the annual of solarist studies  or rather  without having read it  i knew of its existence   but was it not a document of purely historical interest  as for ravintzer and  the little apocrypha   i had never heard of them 
     what next 
     i was already a quarter of an hour late for my meeting with snow  with my back to the door  i looked the room over carefully once more  only then did i notice the bed standing up against the wall  half concealed by a large map of solaris  something was hanging down behind the map  it was a pocket tape recorder  and i noted that nine tenths of the tape had been used  i took the machine out of its case  which i hung back where i had found it  and slipped it into my pocket 
     before leaving  i listened intently with my eyes closed  there was no sound from outside  i opened the door on to a yawning gulf of darkness   until it occurred to me to remove my dark glasses  the dome was feebly lit by the glowing filaments in the ceiling 
     a number of corridors spread out in a star shaped pattern between the four doors of the sleeping quarters and the narrow passage leading to the radio cabin  suddenly  looming up in the opening which led to the communal bathroom  a tall silhouette appeared  barely distinguishable in the surrounding gloom  i stood stock still  frozen to the spot  a giant negress was coming silently towards me with a smooth  rolling gait  i caught a gleam from the whites of her eyes and heard the soft slapping of her bare feet  she was wearing nothing but a yellow skirt of plaited straw  her enormous breasts swung freely and her black arms were as thick as thighs  less than a yard separated us as she passed me  but she did not give me so much as a glance  she went on her way  her grass skirt swinging rhythmically  resembling one of those steatopygous statues in anthropological museums  she opened gibarians door and on the threshold her silhouette stood out distinctly against the bright light from inside the room  then she closed the door behind her and i was alone 
     terror stricken  i stared blankly round the big  empty hall  what had happened  what had i seen  suddenly  my mind reeled as i recalled snows warnings  who was this monstrous aphrodite  i took a step  a single pace  in the direction of gibarians room  but i knew perfectly well that i would not go in 
     i do not know how long i remained leaning against the cool metal wall  hearing nothing except the distant  monotonous whine of the air conditioners  eventually i pulled myself together and made my way to the radio cabin  as i pressed down the door handle  i heard a harsh voice 
      whos there  
      its me  kelvin  
     snow was seated at a table between a pile of aluminum crates and the transmitter  eating meat concentrate straight out of a tin  did he then never leave the place  dazedly  i watched him chewing until i realized that i  too  was famished  i went to a cupboard  selected the least dusty plate i could find  and sat down opposite snow  we ate in silence 
     snow got up  uncorked a vacuum flask and filled two tumblers with clear  hot soup  then he put the flask down on the floor  there was no room on the table 
      have you seen sartorius   he asked 
      no  where is he  
    upstairs  
     upstairs  that meant the laboratory  we finished our meal without exchanging another word  snow dutifully scraping the bottom of his tin  the outer shutter was in place over the window and reflections from the four ceiling lights gleamed on the laminated surface of the transmitter  snow had put on a loose black sweater  frayed at the wrists  the taut skin over his cheekbones was marbled with tiny blood vessels 
      whats the matter   he asked 
      nothing  why  
      youre pouring with sweat  
     i wiped my forehead  it was true  i was dripping wet  it must have been reaction  after my unexpected encounter  snow gave me a questioning glance  should i tell him  if only he had taken me into his confidence       what incomprehensible game was being played here  and who was whose enemy 
      its hot  i should have expected your air conditioning to work better than this  
      it adjusts itself automatically every hour   he looked at me closely   are you sure its only the heat  
     i did not answer  he tossed the utensils and the empty tins into the sink  returned to his armchair and went on with his interrogation 
      what are your plans  
      that depends on you   i answered coolly   i suppose you have a research programme  a new stimulus  x rays  that sort of thing       
     he frowned 
      x rays  whos been talking to you about that  
      i dont remember  someone dropped a hint   on the  prometheus  perhaps  why  have you begun  
      i dont know the details  it was an idea of gibarians  he and sartorius set it up together  i wonder how you could have heard of it  
     i shrugged my shoulders 
      funny that you shouldnt know the details  you ought to  since youre the one who     
  
     i left the sentence unfinished  snow said nothing 
     the whining of the air conditioners had stopped  the temperature stayed at a bearable level  but a high pitched drone persisted  like the buzzing of a dying insect 
     snow got up from his chair and leaned over the console of the transmitter  he began to press knobs at random  and to no effect  since he had left the activating switch off  he went on fidgeting with them for a moment  then he remarked        there are certain formalities to be dealt with concerning       
      yes   i prompted  to his back 
     he turned round and gave me a hostile look  involuntarily  i had annoyed him  but ignorant of the role he was playing  i could only wait and see  his adams apple rose and fell inside the collar of his sweater 
      youve been into gibarians room   he blurted out accusingly 
     i looked at him calmly 
      you  have  been in there  havent you  
      if you say so       
      was there anyone there  
     so he had seen her  or  at least  knew of her existence 
      no  no one  who could there have been  
      why didnt you let me in  then  
      because i was afraid  i thought of your warnings and when the handle moved  i automatically hung on to it  why didnt you say it was you  i would have let you in  
      i thought it was sartorius   he answered  in a faltering voice 
      and suppose it had been  
     once again  he parried my question with one of his own 
      what do you think happened in there  
     i hesitated 
      youre the one who should know  where is he  
      gibarian  in the cold store  we took him there straight away this morning  after wed found him in the locker  
      the locker  was he dead  
      his heart was still beating  but he had stopped breathing  
      did you try resuscitation  
      no  
      why not  
      i didnt have the chance   he mumbled   by the time id moved him  he was dead  
     snow picked up a sheet of paper from the fitted desk in the corner and held it out to me 
      i have drafted a post mortem report  im not sorry youve seen the room  as a matter of fact  cause of death   pernostal injection  lethal dose  its all here       
     i ran my eyes over the paper  and murmured 
      suicide  for what reason  
      nervous troubles  depression  call it what you like  you know more about that sort of thing than i do  
     i was still seated  snow was standing over me 
     looking him in the eye  i said 
      i only know what ive seen for myself  
      what are you trying to say   he asked calmly 
      he injected himself with pernostal and hid in the locker  right  in that case  its not a question of nervous troubles or a fit of depression  but of a very serious paranoid condition   speaking more and more deliberately and continuing to look him in the eyes  i added   what is certain is that he thought he saw something  
     snow began fiddling with the transmitter again 
     after a moments silence  i went on 
      your signatures here  what about sartoriuss  
      as i told you  hes in the laboratory  he never shows his face  i suppose hes              what  
      locked himself in  
      locked himself in  i see       you mean hes barricaded himself in  
      possibly  
      snow  theres someone on the station  someone apart from us  
     he had stopped playing with the knobs and was leaning sideways  staring at me 
      youve seen it  
      you warned me  against what  against whom  an hallucination  
      what did you see  
      shall we say       a human being  
     he remained silent  turning his back as though to hide his face from me  he tapped the metal plating with his finger tips  i looked at his hands  there was no longer any trace of blood between the fingers  i had a brief moment of dizziness 
     in scarcely more than a whisper  as though i were imparting a secret and afraid of being overhead  i said 
      its not a mirage  is it  its a real person  someone you can touch  someone you can       draw blood from  and whats more  someone youve seen only today  
      how do you know  
     he had not moved  his face was still obstinately turned to the wall and i was addressing his back 
      it was before i arrived  just before i arrived  wasnt it  
     his whole body contracted  and i could see his panic stricken expression 
      what about you   he said in a strangled voice   who are you  
     i thought he was about to attack me  it was not at all the reaction i had expected  the situation was becoming grotesque  obviously  he did not believe that i was who i claimed to be  but what could this mean  he was becoming more and more terrified of me  was he delirious  could he have been affected by unfiltered gases from the planets atmosphere  anything seemed possible  and then again  i too had seen this       creature  so what about me 
      who is she   i asked 
     these words reassured him  for a moment  he looked at me searchingly  as though he was still doubtful of me  then he collapsed into his chair and put his head in his hands  even before he opened his mouth  i knew that he had still not made up his mind to give me a direct answer 
      im worn out   he said weakly 
      who is she   i insisted 
      if you dont know       
      go on  know what  
      nothing  
      listen  snow  we are isolated  completely cut off  lets put our cards on the table  things are confused enough as it is  youve got to tell me what you know         what about you   he retorted  suspiciously 
      all right  ill tell you and then you tell me  dont worry  i shant think youre mad  
      mad  good god   he tried to smile   but you havent understood a thing  not a single thing  he never for one moment thought that he was mad  if he had he would never have done it  he would still be alive  
      in other words  your report  this business of nervous troubles  is a fabrication         of course  
      why not write the truth  
      why   he repeated 
     a long silence followed  it was true that i was still completely in the dark  i had been under the impression that i had overcome his doubts and that we were going to pool our resources to solve the enigma  why  then  was he refusing to talk 
      where are the robots  
      in the store rooms  weve locked them all away  only the reception robots are operational  
      why  
     once more  he refused to answer 
      you dont want to talk about it  
      i cant  
     he seemed constantly on the point of unburdening himself  only to pull himself up at the last moment  perhaps i would do better to tackle sartorius  then i remembered the letter and  as i thought of it  realized how important it was 
      do you intend continuing with the experiments  
     he gave a contemptuous shrug 
      what good would that do  
      oh   in that case  what do you suggest we do  
     he was silent  in the distance  there was a faint noise of bare feet padding over the floor  the muffled echo of these shuffling steps reverberated eerily among the nickelplated and laminated equipment and the tall shafts  furrowed with glass tubes  which encased the complicated electronic installations 
     unable to control myself any longer  i stood up  as i listened to the approaching footsteps  i watched snow  behind the drooping lids  his eyes showed no fear  was he not afraid of her  then 
      where does she come from   i asked 
      i dont know  
     the sound of the footsteps faded  then died away 
      dont you believe me   he said   i swear to you that i dont know  
     in the silence that followed  i opened a locker  pushed the clumsy atmosphere suits aside and found  as i expected  hanging at the back  the gas pistols used for manoeuvering in space  i took one out  checked the charge  and slung the harness over my shoulder  it was not strictly speaking  a weapon  but it was better than nothing 
     as i was adjusting a strap  snow showed his yellow teeth in a mocking grin 
      good hunting   he said 
     i turned towards the door 
      thanks  
     he dragged himself out of his chair 
      kelvin  
     i looked at him  he was no longer smiling  i have never seen such an expression of weariness on anyones face 
     he mumbled 
      kelvin  it isnt that       really  i       i cant       
     i waited  his lips moved  but uttered no sound  i turned on my heel and went out
