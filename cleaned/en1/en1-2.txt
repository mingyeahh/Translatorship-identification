 in the empty corridor i stood for a moment in front of the closed door  i noticed a strip of plaster carelessly stuck on one of the panels  pencilled on it was the word  man   at the sight of this faintly scribbled word  i had a sudden longing to return to snow for company  but i thought better of it 
     his crazy warnings still ringing in my ears  i started off down the narrow  tubular passage which was filled with the moaning of the wind  my shoulders bowed under the weight of the spacesuit  on tip toe  half consciously fleeing from some invisible watcher  i found two doors on my left and two more on my right  i read the occupants names  dr  gibarian  dr  snow  dr  sartorius  on the fourth  there was no nameplate  i hesitated  then pressed the handle down gently and slowly opened the door  as i did so  i had a premonition  amounting almost to a certainty  that there was someone inside  i went in 
     there was no one  another wide panoramic window  almost as large as the one in the cabin where i had found snow  overhung the ocean  which  sunlit on this side  shone with an oleaginous gleam  as though the waves secreted a reddish oil  a crimson glow pervaded the whole room  whose lay out suggested a ships cabin  on one side  flanked by book filled shelves  a retractable bed stood against the wall  on the other  between the numerous lockers  hung nickel frames enclosing a series of aerial photographs stuck end to end with adhesive tape  and racks full of test tubes and retorts plugged with cotton wool  two tiers of white enamel boxes took up the space beneath the window  i lifted some of the lids  the boxes were crammed with all kinds of instruments  intertwined with plastic tubing  the corners of the room were occupied by a refrigerator  a tap and a demisting device  for lack of space on the big table by the window  a microscope stood on the floor  turning round  i saw a tall locker beside the entrance door  it was half open  filled with atmosphere suits  laboratory smocks  insulated aprons  underclothing  boots for planetary exploration  and aluminum cylinders  portable oxygen gear  two sets of this equipment  complete with masks  hung down from one of the knobs of the vertical bed  everywhere there was the same chaos  a general disorder which someone had made a hasty attempt to disguise  i sniffed the air  i could detect a faint smell of chemical reagents and traces of something more acrid   chlorine  instinctively i searched the ceiling for the grills over the air vents  strips of paper attached to the bars were fluttering gently  the air was circulating normally  in order to make a relatively free space around the bed  between the bookshelves and the locker  i cleared two chairs of their litter of books  instruments  and tools  which i piled haphazardly on the other side of the room 
     i pulled out a bracket to hang up my spacesuit  took hold of the zip fastener  then let go again  deterred by the confused idea that i was depriving myself of a shield  i could not bring myself to remove it  once more i looked round the room  i checked that the door was shut tight and that it had no lock  and after a brief hesitation i dragged some of the heaviest boxes to the doorway  having built this temporary barricade  i freed myself from my clanking armor in three quick movements  a narrow looking glass  built into the locker door  reflected part of the room  and out of the corner of my eye i caught sight of something moving  i jumped  but it was only my own reflection  underneath the spacesuit  my overalls were drenched with sweat  i took them off and pulled back a sliding door  revealing the bright tiled walls of a small bathroom  a long  flat box lay in the hollow at the base of the shower  i carried it into the room  as i put it down  the springlid flew up and disclosed a number of compartments filled with strange objects  misshapen forms in a dark metal  grotesque replicas of the instruments in the racks  not one of the tools was usable  they were blunted  distorted  melted  as though they had been in a furnace  strangest of all  even the porcelain handles  virtually incombustible  were twisted out of shape  even at maximum temperature  no laboratory furnace could have melted them  only  perhaps  an atomic pile  i took a geiger counter from the pocket on my spacesuit  but when i held it over the debris  it remained dumb 
     by now i was wearing nothing but my underwear  i tore it off  flung it across the room and dashed under the shower  the shock of the water did me good  turning beneath the scalding  needle sharp jets  i scrubbed myself vigorously  splashing the walls  expelling  eradicating from my skin the thick scum of morbid apprehensions which had pervaded me since my arrival 
     i rummaged in the locker and found a work suit which could also be worn under an atmosphere suit  as i pocketed my few belongings  i felt something hard tucked between the pages of my notebook  it was a key  the key to my apartment  down there on earth  absently  i turned it over in my fingers  finally i put it down on the table  it occurred to me suddenly that i might need a weapon  an all purpose pocket knife was hardly sufficient for my needs  but i had nothing else  and i was not going to start searching for a gamma pistol or something else of the kind 
     i sat down on a tubular stool in the middle of the clear space  glad to be alone  and seeing with satisfaction that i had over half an hour to myself   by nature  i have always been scrupulous about keeping engagements  whether important or trivial   the hands of the clock  its face divided into twenty four hours  pointed to seven oclock  the sun was setting  07 00 hours here was 20 00 hours on board the  prometheus   on moddards screens  solaris would be nothing but an indistinct dust cloud  mingled with the stars  but what did the  prometheus  matter to me now  i closed my eyes  i could hear no sound except the moaning of the ventilation pipes and a faint trickling of water from the bathroom 
     if i had understood correctly  it was only a short time since gibarian had died  what had they done with his body  had they buried it  no  that was impossible on this planet  i puzzled over the question for a long time  concentrating on the fate of the corpse  then  realizing the absurdity of my thoughts  i began to pace up and down  my toe knocked against a canvas bag half buried under a pile of books  i bent down and picked it up  it contained a small bottle made of colored glass  so light that it might have been blown out of paper  i held it up to the window in the purplish glow of the somber twilight  now overhung by a sooty fog  what was i doing  allowing myself to be distracted by irrelevancies  by the first trifle which came to hand 
     i gave a start  the lights had gone on  activated by a photo electric relay  the sun had set  what would happen next  i was so tense that the sensation of an empty space behind me became unbearable  in an attempt to pull myself together  i took a chair over to the bookshelves and chose a book familiar to me  the second volume of the early monograph by hughes and eugel   historia solaris   i rested the thick  solidly bound volume on my knees and began leafing through the pages 
     the discovery of solaris dated from about 100 years before i was born 
     the planet orbits two suns  a red sun and a blue sun  for 45 years after its discovery  no spacecraft had visited solaris  at that time  the gamow shapley theory   that life was impossible on planets which are satellites of two solar bodies   was firmly believed  the orbit is constantly being modified by variations in the gravitational pull in the course of its revolutions around the two suns 
     due to these fluctuations in gravity  the orbit is either flattened or distended and the elements of life  if they appear  are inevitably destroyed  either by intense heat or an extreme drop in temperature  these changes take place at intervals estimated in millions of years   very short intervals  that is  according to the laws of astronomy and biology  evolution takes hundreds of millions of years if not a billion  
     according to the earliest calculations  in 500 000 years time solaris would be drawn one half of an astronomic unit nearer to its red sun  and a million years after that would be engulfed by the incandescent star 
     a few decades later  however  observations seemed to suggest that the planets orbit was in no way subject to the expected variations  it was stable  as stable as the orbit of the planets in our own solar system 
     the observations and calculations were reworked with great precision  they simply confirmed the original conclusions  solariss orbit was unstable 
     a modest item among the hundreds of planets discovered annually   to which official statistics devoted only a few lines defining the characteristics of their orbits   solaris eventually began to attract special attention and attain a high rank 
     four years after this promotion  overflying the planet with the  laakon  and two auxiliary craft  the ottenskjold expedition undertook a study of solaris  this expedition being in the nature of a preliminary  not to say improvised  reconnaissance  the scientists were not equipped for a landing  ottenskjold placed a quantity of automatic observation satellites into equatorial and polar orbit  their principal function being to measure the gravitational pull  in addition  a study was made of the planets surface  which is covered by an ocean dotted with innumerable flat  low lying islands whose combined area is less than that of europe  although the diameter of solaris is a fifth greater than earths  these expanses of barren  rocky territory  irregularly distributed  are largely concentrated in the southern hemisphere  at the same time the composition of the atmosphere   devoid of oxygen   was analyzed  and precise measurements made of the planets density  from which its albedo and other astronomical characteristics were determined  as was foreseeable  no trace of life was discovered  either on the islands or in the ocean 
     during the following ten years  solaris became the center of attraction for all observatories concerned with the study of this region of space  for the planet had in the meantime shown the astonishing faculty of maintaining an orbit which ought  without any shadow of doubt  to have been unstable  the problem almost developed into a scandal  since the results of the observations could only be inaccurate  attempts were made  in the interests of science  to denounce and discredit various scientists or else the computers they used 
     lack of funds delayed the departure of a proper solaris expedition for three years  finally shannahan assembled his team and obtained three c tonnage vessels from the institute  the largest starships of the period  a year and a half before the arrival of the expedition  which left from the region of alpha in aquarius  a second exploration fleet  acting in the name of the institute  placed an automatic satellite   luna 247   into orbit around solaris  this satellite  after three successive reconstructions at roughly tenyear intervals  is still functioning today  the data it supplied confirmed beyond doubt the findings of the ottenskjold expedition concerning the active character of the oceans movements 
     one of shannahans ships remained in orbit  while the two others  after some preliminary attempts  landed in the southern hemisphere  in a rocky area about 600 miles square  the work of the expedition lasted eighteen months and was carried out under favorable conditions  apart from an unfortunate accident brought about by the malfunction of some apparatus  in the meantime  the scientists had split into two opposing camps  the bone of contention was the ocean  on the basis of the analyses  it had been accepted that the ocean was an organic formation  at that time  no one had yet dared to call it living   but  while the biologists considered it as a primitive formation   a sort of gigantic entity  a fluid cell  unique and monstrous  which they called prebiological   surrounding the globe with a colloidal envelope several miles thick in places   the astronomers and physicists asserted that it must be an organic structure  extraordinarily evolved  according to them  the ocean possibly exceeded terrestrial organic structures in complexity  since it was capable of exerting an active influence on the planets orbital path  certainly  no other factor could be found that might explain the behavior of solaris  moreover  the planeto physicists had established a relationship between certain processes of the plasmic ocean and the local measurements of gravitational pull  which altered according to the matter transformations of the ocean 
     consequently it was the physicists  rather than the biologists  who put forward the paradoxical formulation of a plasmic mechanism  implying by this a structure  possibly without life as we conceive it  but capable of performing functional activities   on an astronomic scale  it should be emphasized 
     it was during this quarrel  whose reverberations soon reached the ears of the most eminent authorities  that the gamow shapely doctrine  unchallenged for eighty years  was shaken for the first time 
     there were some who continued to support the gamow shapley contentions  to the effect that the ocean had nothing to do with life  that it was neither parabiological nor prebiological but a geological formation   of extreme rarity  it is true   with the unique ability to stabilize the orbit of solaris  despite the variations in the forces of attraction  le chateliers law was enlisted in support of this argument 
     to challenge this conservative attitude  new hypotheses were advanced   of which civito vittas was one of the most elaborate   proclaiming that the ocean was the product of a dialectical development  on the basis of its earliest pre oceanic form  a solution of slow reacting chemical elements  and by the force of circumstances  the threat to its existence from the changes of orbit   it had reached in a single bound the stage of homeostatic ocean  without passing through all the stages of terrestrial evolution  by passing the unicellular and multicellular phases  the vegetable and the animal  the development of a nervous and cerebral system  in other words  unlike terrestrial organisms  it had not taken hundreds of millions of years to adapt itself to its environment   culminating in the first representatives of a species endowed with reason   but dominated its environment immediately 
     this was an original point of view  nevertheless  the means whereby this collodial envelope was able to stabilize the planets orbit remained unknown  for almost a century  devices had existed capable of creating artificial magnetic and gravitational fields  they were called gravitors  but no one could even guess how this formless glue could produce an effect which the gravitors achieved by the use of complicated nuclear reactions and enormously high temperatures  the newspapers of the day  exciting the curiosity of the layman and the anger of the scientist  were full of the most improbable embroideries on the theme of the solaris mystery  one reporter going so far as to suggest that the ocean was  no less  a distant relation to our electric eels 
     just when a measure of success had been achieved in unravelling this problem  it turned out  as often happened subsequently in the field of solarist studies  that the explanation replaced one enigma by another  perhaps even more baffling 
     observations showed  at least  that the ocean did not react according to the same principles as our gravitors  which  in any case  would have been impossible   but succeeded in controlling the orbital periodicity directly  one result  among others  was the discovery of discrepancies in the measurement of time along one and the same meridian on solaris  thus the ocean was not only in a sense  aware  of the einsteinboevia theory  it was also capable of exploiting the implications of the latter  which was more than we could say of ourselves  
     with the publication of this hypothesis  the scientific world was torn by one of the most violent controversies of the century  revered and universally accepted theories foundered  the specialist literature was swamped by outrageous and heretical treatises  sentient ocean or gravity controlling colloid   the debate became a burning issue 
     all this happened several years before i was born  when i was a student   new data having accumulated in the meantime   it was already generally agreed that there was life on solaris  even if it was limited to a single inhabitant 
     the second volume of hughes and eugel  which i was still leafing through mechanically  began with a systematization that was as ingenious as it was amusing  the table of classification comprised three definitions  type  polythera  class  syncytialia  category  metamorph 
     it might have been thought that we knew of an infinite number of examples of the species  whereas in reality there was only the one   weighing  it is true  some seven hundred billion tons 
     multicolored illustrations  picturesque graphs  analytical summaries and spectral diagrams flickered through my fingers  explaining the type and rhythm of the fundamental transformations as well as chemical reactions  rapidly  infallibly  the thick tome led the reader on to the solid ground of mathematical certitude  one might have assumed that we knew everything there was to be known about this representative of the category metamorph  which lay some hundreds of metres below the metal hull of the station  obscured at the moment by the shadows of the four hour night 
     in fact  by no means everybody was yet convinced that the ocean was actually a living creature  and still less  it goes without saying  a rational one  i put the heavy volume back on the shelf and took up the one next to it  which was in two parts  the first part was devoted to a resume of the countless attempts to establish contact with the ocean  i could well remember how  when i was a student  these attempts were the subject of endless anecdotes  jokes and witticisms  compared with the proliferation of speculative ideas which were triggered off by this problem  medieval scholasticism seemed a model of scientific enlightenment  the second part  nearly 1500 pages long  was devoted exclusively to the bibliography of the subject  there would not have been enough room for the books themselves in the cabin in which i was sitting 
     the first attempts at contact were by means of specially designed electronic apparatus  the ocean itself took an active part in these operations by remodelling the instruments  all this  however  remained somewhat obscure  what exactly did the oceans participation consist of  it modified certain elements in the submerged instruments  as a result of which the normal discharge frequency was completely disrupted and the recording instruments registered a profusion of signals   fragmentary indications of some outlandish activity  which in fact defeated all attempts at analysis  did these data point to a momentary condition of stimulation  or to regular impulses correlated with the gigantic structures which the ocean was in the process of creating elsewhere  at the antipodes of the region under investigation  had the electronic apparatus recorded the cryptic manifestation of the oceans ancient secrets  had it revealed its innermost workings to us  who could tell  no two reactions to the stimuli were the same  sometimes the instruments almost exploded under the violence of the impulses  sometimes there was total silence  it was impossible to obtain a repetition of any previously observed phenomenon  constantly  it seemed  the experts were on the brink of deciphering the ever growing mass of information  was it not  after all  with this object in mind that computers had been built of virtually limitless capacity  such as no previous problem had ever demanded 
      and  indeed  some results  were  obtained  the ocean as a source of electric and magnetic impulses and of gravitation expressed itself in a more or less mathematical language  also  by calling on the most abstruse branches of statistical analysis  it was possible to classify certain frequencies in the discharges of current  structural homologues were discovered  not unlike those already observed by physicists in that sector of science which deals with the reciprocal interaction of energy and matter  elements and compounds  the finite and the infinite  this correspondence convinced the scientists that they were confronted with a monstrous entity endowed with reason  a protoplasmic ocean brain enveloping the entire planet and idling its time away in extravagant theoretical cognitation about the nature of the universe  our instruments had intercepted minute random fragments of a prodigious and everlasting monologue unfolding in the depths of this colossal brain  which was inevitably beyond our understanding 
     so much for the mathematicians  these hypotheses  according to some people  underestimated the resources of the human mind  they bowed to the unknown  proclaiming the ancient doctrine  arrogantly resurrected  of  ignoramus et ignorabimus   others regarded the mathematicians hypotheses as sterile and dangerous nonsense  contributing towards the creation of a modern mythology based on the notion of this giant brain   whether plasmic or electronic was immaterial   as the ultimate objective of existence  the very synthesis of life 
     yet others       but the would be experts were legion and each had his own theory  a comparison of the contact school of thought with other branches of solarist studies  in which specialization had rapidly developed  especially during the last quarter of a century  made it clear that a solarist cybernetician had difficulty in making himself understood to a solarist symmetriadologist  veubeke  director of the institute when i was studying there  had asked jokingly one day   how do you expect to communicate with the ocean  when you cant even understand one another   the jest contained more than a grain of truth 
     the decision to categorize the ocean as a metamorph was not an arbitrary one  its undulating surface was capable of generating extremely diverse formations which resembled nothing ever seen on earth  and the function of these sudden eruptions of plasmic creativity  whether adaptive  explorative or what  remained an enigma 
     lifting the heavy volume with both hands  i replaced it on the shelf  and thought to myself that our scholarship  all the information accumulated in the libraries  amounted to a useless jumble of words  a sludge of statements and suppositions  and that we had not progressed an inch in the 78 years since researches had begun  the situation seemed much worse now than in the time of the pioneers  since the assiduous efforts of so many years had not resulted in a single indisputable conclusion 
     the sum total of known facts was strictly negative  the ocean did not use machines  even though in certain circumstances it seemed capable of creating them  during the first two years of exploratory work  it had reproduced elements of some of the submerged instruments  thereafter  it simply ignored the experiments we went on pursuing  as though it had lost all interest in our instruments and our activities   as though  indeed  it was no longer interested in us  it did not possess a nervous system  to go on with the inventory of negative knowledge  or cells  and its structure was not proteiform  it did not always react even to the most powerful stimuli  it ignored completely  for example  the catastrophic accident which occurred during the second giese expedition  an auxiliary rocket  falling from a height of 300 000 metres  crashed on the planets surface and the radioactive explosion of its nuclear reserves destroyed the plasma within a radius of 2500 metres  
     gradually  in scientific circles  the solaris affair came to be regarded as a lost cause  notably among the administrators of the institute  where voices had recently been raised suggesting that financial support should be withdrawn and research suspended  no one  until then  had dared to suggest the final liquidation of the station  such a decision would have smacked too obviously of defeat  but in the course of semiofficial discussions a number of scientists recommended an honorable withdrawal from solaris 
     many people in the world of science  however  especially among the young  had unconsciously come to regard the affair as a touchstone of individual values  all things considered  they claimed  it was not simply a question of penetrating solarist civilization  it was essentially a test of ourselves  of the limitations of human knowledge  for some time  there was a widely held notion  zealously fostered by the daily press  to the effect that the thinking ocean of solaris was a gigantic brain  prodigiously well developed and several million years in advance of our own civilization  a sort of cosmic yogi  a sage  a symbol of omniscience  which had long ago understood the vanity of all action and for this reason had retreated into an unbreakable silence  the notion was incorrect  for the living ocean was active  not  it is true  according to human ideas   it did not build cities or bridges  nor did it manufacture flying machines  it did not try to reduce distances  nor was it concerned with the conquest of space  the ultimate criterion  some people thought  of mans superiority   but it was engaged in a never ending process of transformation  an ontological autometamorphosis   there were any amount of scientific neologisms in accounts of solarist activities   moreover  any scientist who devotes himself to the study of solariana has the indelible impression that he can discern fragments of an intelligent structure  perhaps endowed with genius  haphazardly mingled with outlandish phenomena  apparently the product of an unhinged mind  thus was born the conception of the autistic ocean as opposed to the ocean yogi 
     these hypotheses resurrected one of the most ancient of philosophical problems  the relation between matter and mind  and between mind and consciousness  du haart was the first to have the audacity to maintain that the ocean possessed a consciousness  the problem  which the methodologists hastened to dub metaphysical  provoked all kinds of arguments and discussions  was it possible for thought to exist without consciousness  could one  in any case  apply the word thought to the processes observed in the ocean  is a mountain only a huge stone  is a planet an enormous mountain  whatever the terminology  the new scale of size introduced new norms and new phenomena 
     the question appeared as a contemporary version of the problem of squaring the circle  every independent thinker endeavored to register his personal contribution to the hoard of solarist studies  new theories proliferated  the ocean was evidence of a state of degeneration  of regression  following a phase of intellectual repletion  it was a deviant neoplasm  the product of the bodies of former inhabitants of the planet  whom it had devoured  swallowed up  dissolving and blending the residue into this unchanging  selfpropagating form  supracellular in structure 
     by the white light of the fluorescent tubes   a pale imitation of terrestrial daylight   i cleared the table of its clutter of apparatus and books  arms outstretched and my hands gripping the chromium edging  i unrolled a map of solaris on the plastic surface and studied it at length  the living ocean had its peaks and its canyons  its islands  which were covered with a decomposing mineral deposit  were certainly related to the nature of the ocean bed  but did it control the eruption and subsidence of the rocky formations buried in its depths  no one knew  gazing at the big flat projection of the two hemispheres  colored in various tones of blue and purple  i experienced once again that thrill of wonder which had so often gripped me  and which i had felt as a schoolboy on learning of the existence of solaris for the first time 
     lost in contemplation of this bewildering map  my mind in a daze  i temporarily forgot the mystery surrounding gibarians death and the uncertainty of my own future 
     the different sections of the ocean were named after the scientists who had explored them  i was examining thexalls swell  which surrounded the equatorial archipelagos  when i had a sudden sensation of being watched 
     i was still leaning over the map  but i no longer saw it  my limbs were in the grip of a sort of paralysis  the crates and a small locker still barricaded the door  which was in front of me  its only a robot  i told myself   yet i had not discovered any in the room and none could have entered without my knowledge  my back and my neck seemed to be on fire  the sensation of this relentless  fixed stare was becoming unbearable  with my head shrinking between my hunched shoulders  i leant harder and harder against the table  until it began slowly to slide away  the movement released me  i spun round 
     the room was empty  there was nothing in front of me except the wide convex window and  beyond it  the night  but the same sensation persisted  the night stared me in the face  amorphous  blind  infinite  without frontiers  not a single star relieved the darkness behind the glass  i pulled the thick curtains  i had been in the station less than an hour  yet already i was showing signs of morbidity  was it the effect of gibarians death  in so far as i knew him  i had imagined that nothing could shake his nerve  now  i was no longer so sure 
   i stood in the middle of the room  beside the table  my breathing became more 
regular  i felt the sweat chill on my forehead  what was it i had been thinking about a moment ago  ah  yes  robots  it was surprising that i had not come across one anywhere on the station   what could have become of them all  the only one with which i had been in contact   at a distance   belonged to the vehicle reception services  but what about the others 
     i looked at my watch  it was time to rejoin snow 
     i left the room  the dome was feebly lit by luminous filaments running the length of the ceiling  i went up to gibarians door and stood there  motionless  there was total silence  i gripped the handle  i had in fact no intention of going in  but the handle went down and the door opened  disclosing a chink of darkness  the lights went on  in one quick movement  i entered and silently closed the door behind me  then i turned round 
     my shoulders brushed against the door panels  the room was larger than mine  a curtain decorated with little pink and blue flowers  not regulation station equipment  but no doubt brought from earth with his personal belongings  covered three quarters of the panoramic window  around the walls were bookshelves and cupboards  painted pale green with silvery highlights  both shelves and cupboards had been emptied of their contents  which were piled into heaps  amongst the furniture  at my feet  blocking the way  were two overturned trolleys buried beneath a heap of periodicals spilling out of bulging brief cases which had burst open  books with their pages splayed out fanwise were stained with colored liquids which had spilt from broken retorts and bottles with corroded stoppers  receptacles made of such thick glass that a single fall  even from a considerable height  could not have shattered them in such a way  beneath the window lay an overturned desk  an anglepoise lamp crumpled underneath it  two legs of an upturned stool were stuck in the half open drawers  a flood of papers of every conceivable size swamped the floor  my interest quickened as i recognized gibarians hand writing  as i stooped to gather together the loose sheets  i noticed that my hand was casting a double shadow 
     i straightened up  the pink curtain glowed brightly  traversed by a streak of incandescent  steely blue light which was gradually widening  i pulled the curtain aside  an unbearable glare extended along the horizon  chasing before it an army of spectral shadows  which rose up from among the waves and dispersed in the direction of the station  it was the dawn  after an hour of darkness the planets second sun   the blue sun   was rising in the sky 
     the automatic switch cut off the lights as i returned to the heap of papers  the first thing i came across was a detailed description of an experiment  evidently decided upon three weeks before  gibarian had planned to expose the plasma to an intensive bombardment of x rays  i gathered from the context that the paper was addressed to sartorius  whose job it was to organize operations  what 1 was holding in my hand was a copy of the plan 
     the whiteness of the paper hurt my eyes  this new day was different from the previous one  in the warm glow of the red sun  mists overhung a black ocean with blood red reflections  and waves  clouds and sky were almost constantly veiled in a crimson haze  now  the blue sun pierced the flower printed curtain with a crystalline light  my suntanned hands looked grey  the room had changed  all the red reflecting objects had lost their luster and had turned a greyish brown  whereas those which were white  green and yellow had acquired a vivid brilliance and seemed to give off their own light  screwing up my eyes  i risked another glance through a chink in the curtain  an expanse of molten metal trembled and shimmered under a white hot sky  i shut my eyes and drew back  on the shelf above the wash basin  which had recently been badly chipped  i found a pair of dark glasses  so big that when i put them on they covered half my face  the curtain appeared to glow with a sodium light  i went on reading  picking up the sheets of paper and arranging them on the only usable table  there were gaps in the text  and i searched in vain for the missing pages      
     i came across a report of experiments already carried out  and learned that  for four days running  gibarian and sartorius had submitted the ocean to radiation at a point 1400 miles from the present position of the station  the use of x rays was banned by a un convention  because of their harmful effects  and i was certain that no one had sent a request to earth for authorization to proceed with such experiments 
     looking up  i caught sight of my face in the mirror of a half open locker door  masked by the dark glasses  it was deathly pale  the room  too  glinting with blue and white reflections  looked equally bizarre  but soon there came a prolonged screech of metal as the air tight outer shutters slid across the window  there was an instant of darkness  and then the lights came on  they seemed to me to be curiously dim  it grew hotter and hotter  the regular drone of the air conditioning was now a high pitched whine  the stations refrigeration plant was running at full capacity  nevertheless  the overpowering heat grew more and more intense 
     i heard footsteps  someone was walking through the dome  in two silent strides  i reached the door  the footsteps slowed down  whoever it was was behind it  the handle moved  automatically  without thinking  i gripped it  the pressure did not increase  but nor did it relax  neither of us  on either side of the door  said a word  we remained there  motionless  each of us holding the handle  suddenly it straightened up again  freeing itself from my grasp  the muffled footsteps receded  with my ear glued to the panel  i went on listening  i heard nothing more
