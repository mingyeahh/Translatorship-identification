The corridor was empty. It led straight at first, then curved to the right. I had never been to the Station, but for six weeks I had lived - as part of my initial training - in an exact copy of it, located in the Institute, on Earth. I knew where the stairs with aluminium steps led. The library was unlit. In the dark, I found the contact. When I searched the file for the first volume of the Solarian yearbook, along with an appendix, a red light came on when I pressed a key. I checked in the recorder - the book was at Gibarian's, as was the other one - that 'Little Apocrypha'. I turned off the light and went back downstairs. I was afraid to go into his cabin despite the footsteps I had heard before. It might have come back there. I stood in front of the door for some time until, clenching my jaws, I forced myself through and entered.
The illuminated room was empty. I started, flipping through the books lying on the floor by the window; at one point I walked over to the wardrobe and closed it. I couldn't look at the empty space between the suits. There was no annexe under the window. I methodically rearranged volume after volume until, having reached the last pile of books resting between the bed and the wardrobe, I found the volume I was looking for.
I hoped to find a clue in it, and indeed - there was a bookmark stuck in the index of names; in red pencil was circled a name that told me nothing: Andre Berton. It appeared on two different pages. I looked first at the earlier place and learned that Berton was the reserve pilot of the Shan-nahana ship. The next mention of him was upwards of a hundred pages further on. Immediately after landing, the expedition proceeded with extreme caution, but when, after sixteen days, it became apparent that the plasmatic ocean was not only showing no signs of aggressiveness, but was retreating from any object approaching its surface and, as it might, avoiding direct contact with cameras or people, Shannahan and his deputy Timo-lis lifted some of the precautionary dictates to proceed, as they were making the work exceedingly difficult and delaying.
The expedition was then broken up into small groups of two and three, making flights of several hundred miles over the ocean at times; the blasters previously used as cover, closing off the work area, were placed at the Base. The first four days after this change in methodology passed without incident, apart from occasional damage to the oxygen equipment in the suits, as the exhaust valves proved sensitive to the corrosive effects of the poisonous atmosphere. As a result, they had to be changed almost daily for new ones.
On day five, and the twenty-first counting from the time of landing, two researchers, Carucci and Fechner (the first was a radiobiolo-g and the second a physicist), made an exploratory flight over the ocean in a small two-man aeromobile. It was not a flying vehicle, but a glider that moves on a cushion of condensed air.
When, after six hours, they did not return, Ti-molis, who had been in charge of the Base in Shannahan's absence, sounded the alarm and sent all available men to search for them. By a fatal coincidence, radio communications broke down that day, about an hour after the exploration groups had left; the cause was a large red sunspot, sending strong corpuscular-larne radiation into the upper layers of the atmosphere. Only the ultra-short-wave instruments were working, allowing communication over distances of no more than twenty-odd miles. To make matters worse, by sunset the fog had thickened and the search had to be discontinued.
Even as the rescue teams were returning to the Base, one discovered the aeromobile, just 80 miles offshore. The engine was running and the machine, undamaged, was hovering above the waves. In the transparent cabin was only one, semi-conscious man - Carucci. The aeromobile was brought to the Base and Ca-rucci was treated medically; he returned to consciousness later that evening. He could say nothing about Fechner's fate. He only remembered that, just as they were about to return, he began to feel short of breath. The exhalation valve of his apparatus was jammed and a small amount of poisonous gases entered the suit with each inhalation.
In an attempt to fix his apparatus, Fechner had to unbuckle his belts and stand up. This was the last thing Carucci remembered. The supposed course of events was - according to the experts' assessment - as follows: while repairing Ca-rucci's apparatus, Fechner opened the roof of the cabin, probably because he could not move freely under the low dome. This was permissible, as the cabin of such machines is not airtight and is only a shelter from the weather and wind. During these manipulations, Fechner's oxygen apparatus must have malfunctioned and, dazed, he climbed up, climbed out through the dome opening onto the back of the machine and fell into the ocean.
Such is the story of the ocean's first victim. The search for the body - it should have been floating on the waves in a wetsuit - yielded no results. Then again, it might have floated: a thorough sweep of thousands of square miles of almost constantly fog-shrouded, rolling desert was beyond the capabilities of the expedition.
By dusk - returning to the accidents of the previous day - all apparatus had returned. rescue except for the large cargo helicopter on which Berton flew out. *
He appeared over the base almost an hour after darkness fell, when he was already seriously feared. He was in a state of nervous shock; he got out of the apparatus with his own strength only to throw himself into flight; restrained, he screamed and cried; in a man who had had seventeen years of space navigation in sometimes the harshest conditions, this was astonishing.
The doctors surmised that Berton too had succumbed to poisoning. After two days, Berton, who even when he had regained his apparent equilibrium, refused to leave the interior of the expedition's main rocket for a moment or even to approach the window from which the view of the ocean opened up, declared that he wished to report on his flight. He insisted on this, claiming that it was of the utmost importance. This report, after being examined by the expedition's council, was considered a morbid creation of the mind, poisoned by the gases of the atmosphere, and as such was added not to the expedition's history, but to Berton's medical history, and that was the end of the whole thing.
That's what the appendix said. I guessed that the crux of the matter was, of course, Berton's report itself - what had driven this long-range pilot to a nervous breakdown. I took to leafing through the books for the second time, but 'Little Apocrypha' was nowhere to be found. I was growing tired, so I postponed further searching until tomorrow and left the cabin. As I passed the aluminium staircase, I saw patches of incident light lying on the steps. So Sartorius was still working, at this hour! I thought I should see him.
It was a little warmer upstairs. A faint breeze gushed through the wide, low corridor. Strands of paper furled memorably over the ventilation outlets. The door of the main laboratory was formed by a thick slab of rough glass, framed by a metal frame. On the inside, the glass was obscured by something dark; light came only through narrow, under-suffixed windows. I pressed the bar. As I expected, the door did not give in. It was silent inside, with the occasional faint screech of a sort of gas flame. I knocked - no answer.
- Sartorius! - I called out. - Dr Sartorius! It's me, the new one, Kelvin! I need to see you, please, open up!
A faint rustle, as if someone were treading on crumpled paper, and silence again.
- It's me, Kelvin! After all, you've heard of me! I flew Prometheus a few hours ago! - I cried out, bringing my mouth close to where the door met the metal frame. - Dr. Sartorius! There's no one here but me! Open the door for me.
Silence. Then a faint murmur. A few clinks, very distinct, as if someone was placing metal tools on a metal tray. And at once I was stunned. A series of tiny footsteps sounded, as if a child were trotting: the dense, hurried thrashing of little feet. I think... someone must have imitated them with extremely skilful fingers on some hollow, well-resonating box.
- Dr. Sartorius!!! - I roared. - Are you opening or not?!
No answer, just that childish trot again and at the same time a few quick, faintly audible, sweeping steps, as if the man were walking on tiptoe. But if he was walking, couldn't he at the same time imitate the gait of a child? What do I care anyway! - I thought and, no longer able to hold back the rage that was beginning to seize me, I banged on: - Dr. Sartorius!!! I didn't fly for sixteen months to be stopped by your comedies!!! I count to ten. Then I'll blow the doors off!!!
I doubted if I would succeed.
The recoil of a gas pistol is not very strong, but I was determined to carry out my threat one way or the other, even if I had to go in search of explosives, of which there was certainly no shortage in the warehouse. I told myself that I must not give in, that is, I must not keep playing with the madness-marked cards that the situation was pushing into my hands. There was a sound as if someone was struggling with someone or pushing something, the curtain in the middle moved away maybe half a metre, a slender shadow fell on the surface of the frosted door, and a slightly hoarse dashing voice spoke:
- I will open, but you must promise not to go inside.
- Then why do you want to open! - I roared.
- I will go out to you.
- Good. I promise.
There was a light clatter of a key being turned in the lock, then a dark silhouette, covering half the door, carefully drew the curtain back, some intricate operations were going on there - I heard the creaking as if of a wooden table being moved, and finally the bright panel - it swung open just enough for Sartorius to slip through into the corridor. He stood in front of me, covering the doorway with himself. He was remarkably tall, skinny; under his cream-coloured leotard, his body seemed to consist of nothing but bones. His neck was wrapped in a black handkerchief; over his shoulder hung a protective laboratory coat folded in two, scorched with reagents. He held his extremely narrow head sideways. Almost half his face was obscured by curved black glasses, so that I could not see his eyes. He had a long lower jaw, a bluish mouth and huge ears, as if frostbitten, because they were also bluish. He was unshaven. From his wrists dangled on loops were counter gloves of red rubber. We stood like that for a while, looking at each other with unconcealed dislike. The remains of his hair (he looked as if he had shaved himself with a hedgehog razor) were leaden, his beard quite grey. His forehead was tanned, like Snaut's, but the tan ended about halfway up in a horizontal line. Apparently he wore some sort of myck constantly in the sun.
- 'I'm listening,' he said at last. It seemed to me that he wasn't so much waiting to hear what I was about to say to him as listening with intensity to the space beyond, still clinging with his back to the glass panel. For a good while, I didn't know how to speak so as not to shoot myself silly. - My name is Kelvin... you must have heard of me - I started. - I am, I mean... I was an associate of Gibarian....
His lean face, all in vertical lines - that must have been what Donkisjot looked like - was expressionless. The black curved plate of the glasses pointed at me made it extremely difficult to speak.
- I found out that Gibarian.... was dead. - I suspended my voice.
- Yes. I'm sorry... It sounded impatient.
- Did he commit suicide?... Who found the body, you or Snaut?
- Why are you turning to me with this? Didn't Dr Snaut tell you...?
- I wanted to hear what you had to say on the matter....
- Are you a psychologist, Dr Kelvin?
- Yes. Why?
- A scientist?
- Well, yes. What's the connection...
- I thought you were a crime official or a police officer. It is now two forty, and you, instead of trying to get involved in the flow of the work going on at the Station, which would have been ultimately understandable, despite this brutal attempt to force your way into the laboratory, are questioning me as if I were at least a suspect.
I mastered myself with an effort from which sweat broke out on my forehead.
- You are a suspect, Sartorius! - I said in a stifled voice.
I wanted to placate him at all costs, so I added fiercely:
- And you know it perfectly well!
- If you don't take it back and apologise to me, I'll complain about you in a radio report, Kelvin!
- What do I have to apologise to you for? For the fact that instead of accepting me, instead of giving me a fair introduction to what you are going through, you lock yourself up and barricade yourself in the laboratory! Have you completely lost your mind! Who are you - a scientist or a miserable coward?! What? Why don't you answer me?! - I don't know what I shouted myself, he didn't even flinch. Thick drops of sweat were trickling down his pale, porous skin. Suddenly I realised: he wasn't listening to me at all! He hid both hands behind him, held the door with all his strength, which trembled slightly as if someone was pushing against it from the other side.
- Let... you... go away... - he groaned at once in a strange, squeaky voice. - Go away... for God's sake, go downstairs, I'll come, I'll come, I'll do whatever you want, but go!!!
Such was the agony in his voice that, quite stupefied, I raised my hand reflexively, wanting to help him hold the door, as that was clearly what he was struggling for, but he then let out a horrible scream, as if I had swung a knife at him, so I started to retreat backwards, then he kept shouting in a falsetto "Go! go!" - then again "I'm coming back now! I'm coming back now!!!! No! no!!!"
He swung the door open and dashed inside, it seemed to me that something golden flashed at the height of his chest, as if some kind of shining disc, a deafening rumble was now coming from the laboratory, the curtain flew to the side, a great tall shadow flitted across the glass screen, the curtain returned to its place and nothing more could be seen. What was happening there! Footsteps stomped, a frantic scurry broke off with a shrill, glassy rumble and I heard the shrill laughter of a child....
My legs shook beneath me; I looked around in all directions. There was silence. I sat down on the low plastic window sill. I sat there for perhaps a quarter of an hour, I don't know whether I was waiting for something or just so driven that I didn't even want to get up. My head was pounding. Somewhere, high up, I heard a prolonged grinding and at the same time the surroundings brightened.
From where I was sitting, I could only see part of the circular corridor that encircled the laboratory. It was located at the very top of the Station, just below the shield of the top armour, so the outer walls were concave and sloping, with windows placed every few metres, like shooting galleries; the obscuring flaps from the outside were just rising, the blue day was coming to an end. A dazzling glare burst through the thick glass. Every nickel trim, every handle lit up like a small sun. The door to the laboratory - that great slab of rough glass - glowed like the opening of a furnace. I stared at my hands, gray in this ghastly light, folded in my lap. In my right hand I held a gas pistol; I had no idea when or how I had snatched it from its case. I let it back in there. I already knew that not even an atomic thrower would help me, what could I do with it! Break down the door? Break into the laboratory? I stood up. A shield collapsing into the ocean, like a hydrogen explosion, sent a horizontal burst of rays behind me, almost material; when they hit my cheek (I was already going down the steps), it was like applying a hot seal.
Halfway down the stairs I blushed and went back up. I walked around the laboratory. As I said, a corridor surrounded it: having walked a hundred steps or so, I found myself on the other side, facing a completely similar glass door. I didn't try to open it, I knew it was locked.
I was looking for a window in the plastic wall, even a crack of some kind; the thought of peeping at Sartorius did not seem at all unworthy of me. I wanted to put an end to conjecture and find out the truth, although I couldn't imagine how I would be able to understand it.
It occurred to me that the light was given to the laboratory halls by ceiling windows, that is to say, placed in the top armour, and if I got outside, I could, perhaps, look in through them. In order to do this, I had to go downstairs to get a suit and an oxygen apparatus. I stood at the foot of the stairs, wondering if the game was worth the candle. It was quite likely that the glass of the upper windows was frosted, but what was left for me. I descended to the middle level. I had to walk past the radio station. The door was open wide. He was sitting in an armchair just as I had left him.
He was asleep. At the sound of my footsteps he twitched and opened his eyes.
- Hello, Kelvin! - he spoke up in an ochre voice. I remained silent.
- Well, did you find out anything? - he asked.
- Yes," I replied slowly. - He is not alone.
He curled his lips.
- Well, there you go. That's something. He has visitors, you say?
- I don't understand why you don't want to tell me what it is - I threw it out as if out of the blue. - After all, staying here I'll find out sooner or later anyway. So why all the secrecy?
- You'll understand when you have guests yourself," he said. It looked to me like he was waiting for something and didn't really want to talk.
- Where are you going? - he chuckled when I turned around. I didn't answer. The airport hall was in the same state I had left it in. On the rise stood my deflated tray open to the light. I approached the racks of suits, but was suddenly put off by this escapade into the top armour. I turned around on the spot and made my way down the winding stairs to the storerooms. The narrow corridor was full of cylinders and crates stacked on top of each other. The walls here were bare metal, gleaming bluishly in the light. A few dozen more steps and the white-frosted pipes of the cooling apparatus appeared under the ceiling. I followed them. They were penetrating through a thick plastic flange into a tightly closed room. When I opened the heavy, two-hand-thick door with its rubber edging, I was enveloped in bone-penetrating frost. I trembled. Ice icicles dangled from a thicket of snow-covered coils. And here stood snow-covered crates, bins, shelves against the walls were full of cans and yellowish lumps of some kind of fat wrapped in clear plastic. In the depths, the barrel-shaped ceiling was lowering. A thick curtain hung there, sparkling with ice needles. I peeled back its edge. On a lair of aluminium bars rested a large, oblong shape covered in grey cloth. I lifted the edge of the sheet and looked into Gibarian's sinewy face. Black hair with a grey strand above the forehead clung smoothly to the skull, The larynx stood high, breaking the neck. Dry eyes stared vertically into the ceiling, a cloudy blob of ice gathered in the corner of the eyelid. The cold so pierced me that I struggled to hold back the gritting of my teeth. Without letting go of the shroud, I touched his po-count with my other hand. It was quite as if I had touched frozen wood. The skin was scraggly from the stubble that pierced it with black dots. An expression of immeasurable, contemptuous patience froze in the folding of my lips. Lowering the edge of the cloth, I noticed that on the other side of the body several black, oblong beads or beans, from the smallest to the largest, were poking out from under the folds. At once I froze.
These were the toes of naked feet seen from the soles, the egg-shaped bellies of the toes stood out slightly; beneath the crumpled edge of the shroud lay, flattened, a black bead.
She was resting on her face, as if plunged into a deep sleep. Inch by inch I pulled back the thick material. The head, covered in hair, ruffled into small, bluish bundles, lay in the bend of an equally black, massive arm. The glistening skin of its back strained the hills of its spine. The colossal body was not animated by the slightest movement. I looked once more at the bare soles of her feet and was then struck by a strange thing: they were not flattened or compacted by the weight they had to support, they were not even calloused from walking barefoot, they were covered by skin as thin as that of the back or the hands.
I checked this impression with a touch that came far harder to me than touching a dead body. Then an unbelievable thing happened: this body, exposed to twenty degrees of frost, was alive and moved. It pulled its foot up like a sleeping dog when you take it by the paw. 'It's going to freeze here,' I thought, but her body was calm and not too cold, I could still feel the soft touch unraveling in my fingertips. I retreated backwards behind the curtain, lowered it and returned to the corridor. It seemed to me to be incredibly hot inside. The stairs led me right out to the airport hall. I sat down on a rolled up breast-thin parachute and took my head in my hands. I felt bruised. I didn't know what was happening to me. I was shattered, my thoughts were sliding down some cliff threatening to collapse - loss of consciousness, annihilation seemed an unspoken, unreachable grace.
I had no reason to go to Snaut or Sarto-rius, I couldn't imagine that anyone could put together what I had experienced so far, what I had seen, what I had touched with my own hands. The only rescue - escape - explanation was a diagnosis of madness. Yes: I must have gone mad, and immediately after landing. The ocean had affected my brain in this way - I was experiencing hallucination after hallucination, and since I was, there was no need to waste my strength in futile attempts to unravel puzzles that did not exist in reality, but to seek medical help, to call from the radio station Prometheus or some other ship, to send SOS signals.
Then something happened that I would rather not have expected: the thought that I was crazy calmed me down.
I understood Snau-ta's words all too well - if we assume that there was a Snaut at all and that I ever spoke to him, after all, the hallucinations could have started much earlier - who knows if I wasn't still aboard the Prometheus, stricken by a sudden attack of mental illness, and everything I experienced was a creation of my irritated brain? However, if I was ill, I could recover, and this gave me at least the hope of deliverance, which I was in no way able to discern in the tangled nightmares of a few hours of mere Solarian experience.
It was therefore necessary, first of all, to carry out some logically conceived experiment on myself - experimentum cru-cis - which would show me whether I had really gone mad and was a victim of the hallucinations of my own imagination, or whether, despite their absurdity and unlikelihood, my experiences were real.
I pondered this while gazing at the metal bracket that supported the airport's support structure. It was a steel mast protruding from the wall, embanked with convex metal sheets, painted a celadon colour; in several places, at a height of about a metre, the varnish was peeling off, probably by the rocket trucks moving through it. I touched the steel, warmed it for a moment with my hand, knocked on the rolled-up edge of the protective plate; could delirium reach such a degree of reality? 'Maybe,' I answered myself; after all, this was my field, I knew it.
And is it possible to invent this crucial experiment? At first I thought not, for my sick brain (if it really is sick) will produce whatever delusions I demand of it. After all, not only in illness, but also in the most normal dream, it happens that we talk to people we don't know on waking, that we ask these dream characters questions and hear their answers; at the same time - even though these people are in fact only foetuses of our own psyche, pseudo-independent parts of it isolated in time, so to speak - we don't know what words will come from their mouths until they speak to us (in the dream). And yet they really are words crafted by that disembodied part of our own mind, and therefore we should already know them the moment we invented them ourselves, in order to put them into the mouth of a fictional character. Whatever I had planned and realised, therefore, I could always tell myself that I had acted just as one acts in a dream. Neither Snaut nor Sartorius had to exist in reality, so posing any questions to them both was futile.
I thought I might take some sort of medicine, some potent agent such as peyote or some other preparation that induces hallucinations and colourful visions. Experiencing such phenomena would prove that what I had taken really existed and was part of the material reality around me. But even this," I continued to think, "would not have been a desirable key experiment, because I knew how the remedy (which I had to choose myself) should work, and therefore it could be that both the taking of this medicine and the effects caused by it would equally be creations of my imagination.
I was already thinking that, locked in a circle of madness, I would not be able to break out of it - after all, you can't think other than with your brain, you can't be outside yourself to check the normality of the processes going on in your body - when a thought suddenly dawned on me that was as simple as it was pertinent.
I sprang from the pile of rolled up parachutes and ran straight to the radio station. It was empty. In passing I glanced at the electric wall clock. It was approaching four o'clock at night, the Station's conventional night, for outside there was a red dawn. I quickly activated the long-range radio communication apparatus, and while waiting for the lamps to heat up, I once again set down the various stages of the experiment in my mind.
I couldn't remember what the call sign of the automatic circumbinary Sateloid station was, but I found it on a plaque hanging above the main console. I sent the call in Morse code and after eight seconds a reply came. The Sateloid, or rather its electron brain, reported with a rhythmically repeated signal.
I then demanded that it tell me which meridians of the Galaxy's stellar canopy it was crossing at twenty-second intervals orbiting Solaris, and to the fifth decimal place.
I then sat down and waited for an answer. It came after ten minutes. I tore off the paper tape with the printed result and, having hidden it in a drawer (and I was careful not to even glance at it), I fetched from the library large sky maps, logarithmic tables, an almanac of the satellite's diurnal motion and a few ancillary books, then set about finding the answer to the same question. It took me almost an hour to work out the equations; I can't remember the last time I calculated like that, probably when I was still at university for an exam in practical astronomy. I did the calculations on the Station's big calculator. My reasoning ran as follows: from the sky maps I should get figures that do not quite coincide with the data provided by the Sateloid. Not completely, because the Sateloid is subject to very complicated perturbations under the influence of the gravitational forces of Solaris, its two orbiting suns, as well as local variations in gravity caused by the ocean. Once I have the two series of digits, provided by the Sateloid and calculated theoretically based on the sky maps, I will make corrections to my calculations; then the two groups of results should coincide to the fourth decimal place; deviations will only remain in the fifth places, as being caused by the incalculable activity of the ocean.
Even if the figures, provided by the Sateloid, are not reality but the product of my deranged mind, they will still not be able to coincide with the second series of figures. For my brain may be sick, but it would not - under any circumstances - be able to carry out the calculus made by the Station's great calculator, as this would require months of time. So - if the figures are correct - the great Station calculator really exists and I used it in reality, not in delusion.
My hands trembled as I took the paper telegraph tape from the drawer and spread it out next to the other, wider one from the calculator. Both series of digits agreed as I had predicted, up to the fourth place. Deviations only appeared on the fifth. I hid all the papers in a drawer. So the calculator existed independently of me; this entailed the reality of the existence of the Station and everything on it.
I was about to close the drawer when I noticed that it was filled with a whole bundle of sheets covered in impatient calculations. I pulled it out; a glance indicated that someone had already conducted an experiment similar to mine, except that instead of data relative to the stellar canopy, it requested Sateloid measurements of the albedo of Solaris at forty-second intervals.
I was not mad. The last glimmer of hope was extinguished. I switched off the transmitter, drank the remaining bouillon from the thermos and went to bed.
