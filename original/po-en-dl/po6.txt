The skin on my face and hands was burnt. I remembered that while I was looking for a sleeping remedy for Harey (I would laugh at my naivety now if I could), I had noticed a jar of anti-burn ointment in the medicine cabinet, so I went in myself. I opened the door and, in the red light of the west, saw that someone was sitting in the chair where Harey had knelt before. Fear paralysed me, I lumbered back panic-stricken to throw myself into flight; it lasted a fraction of a second. The sitter raised his head. It was Snaut. With his leg over, his back turned to me (he still wore the same reagent-burned canvas trousers) he was looking through some papers. A whole bundle of them lay next to him on the coffee table. At the sight of me, he put them all down and stared at me for a moment, grimacing, over his glasses, which were lowered to the end of his nose.
Without a word, I went to the washroom, took a semi-liquid ointment from the medicine cabinet and began to rub it on the most burned areas of my forehead and cheeks. Luckily, I did not swell much, and my eyes survived thanks to the fact that I clamped my eyelids tightly shut. I pricked a few larger blisters on my temple and cheek with a sterile injection needle and squeezed the serous fluid out of them. Then I taped two patches of moistened gauze over my face. All the time Snaut was watching me intently. I ignored it. When I finally finished these treatments (and my face was burning more and more), I sat down in the second chair. First I had to remove Harey's dress from it. It was a perfectly ordinary dress, except for the story with the clasp, which wasn't there.
Snaut, with his hands folded over his pointy knee, followed my movements critically.
- 'Well, how about we have a chat? - he spoke up when I sat down.
I didn't answer, squeezing the flap of gauze that had begun to slip down my cheek.
- We had visitors, didn't we?
- Yes - I replied dryly. I didn't have the slightest desire to tune into his tone.
- And we got rid of? Well, well, you took to it impetuously.
He touched the still flaky skin on his forehead. Pink patches of fresh skin were showing on it. I stared at them with ba- hurt. Why hadn't the so-called tan of Snaut and Sartorius given me a thought so far? All this time I thought it was from the sun - and yet nobody gets a tan on Solaris....
- But you started modestly, I suppose? - he said, ignoring the flash of sudden understanding that enlightened me. - All sorts of things there, narcoti-ca, venena, free American - what?
- What do you want? We can talk on equal terms. If you want to clown around, you'd better go.
- Sometimes you are a clown in spite of yourself,' he said. He raised his squinted eyes at me.
- 'You're not going to tell me that you didn't use a rope or a hammer? And didn't you sometimes hurl an inkwell like Luther? No? Hey," he croaked, "you're a real braggart! You didn't even try to smash your head, you didn't even demolish your room, you just, like that, just like that, you packed it, shot it, and we're even!
He looked at his watch.
- We should have had about two or three hours," he concluded. He looked at me, looked at me with an unpleasant smile, until he decided:
- So you say you consider me a pig?
- A complete pig," I affirmed emphatically.
- Yes? Would you believe it if I told you? Would you believe a word of it?
I remained silent.
- It happened to Gibarian first - he continued, still with that fake smile. - He locked himself in his cabin and only talked through the door. 'And we, do-you-think, what did we adjudicate? I knew, but I preferred to remain silent.
- Well, of course. We decided he was crazy. He told us something through the door, but not everything. Do you even have any idea why he concealed who was with him? Well, you already know: suum cuiÄ…ue. But he was a real researcher. He demanded that we give him a chance.
- What chance?
- Well, he was trying, I suppose, to classify it somehow, to get to grips with it, to settle it, to work through the night. Do you know what he was doing? You certainly do!
- These calculations - I said. - In a drawer. In the radio station. Is that him?
- Yes. But I didn't know anything about it at the time.
- How long did it last?
- A visitor? A week, I think. Talking through the door. Well, what was going on there. We thought he was hallucinating and being motor stimulated. I was giving him scopolamine.
- What do you mean... Him!?
- Well, yes. He was taking it, but not for himself. He was experimenting. That's how it went.
-- And you...?
- Us? On the third day we decided to get to him, to break down the door, if nothing else, out of nobility we wanted to treat him.
- A... that's why! - I snapped out of it.
_ Yes
- And there... in that wardrobe...
- Yes, dear boy. Yes. He didn't know that in the meantime, we were haunted by visitors too. And we couldn't look after him any more. He didn't know that. Now this... it's a certain... routine. He said it so quietly that I guessed the last word rather than heard it. - Wait, I don't understand," I said. - So what, you must have heard. You said yourself that you were eavesdropping. You must have heard two voices, so...
- No. Just his voice, and even if there were unintelligible murmurs, I think you understand that we attributed them all to him....
- Just his...? But... why?
- I don't know. I have, admittedly, a theory about it. But I think it's not worth rushing into it, especially as explaining this and that doesn't help. Yes. But you must have seen something already yesterday, otherwise you would have taken us both for crazy?
- I thought I was crazy myself.
- Oh, yeah? And you didn't see anyone?
- I did.
- Who!
His grimace was no longer a smile. I looked at him for a long time before I answered:
- That... black...
He did not speak, but his whole shrunken and leaning forward body relaxed slightly.
- 'You could have warned me, though,' I began, already with less conviction.
- I did warn you after all.
- In what way!
- The only way possible. Understand, I did not know who it would be! Nobody knew that, you can't know that...
- Listen, Snaut, a few questions. You've known this... for some time. Is this... is... what's going to happen to her?
- You mean, is she going to come back?
- Yes.
- She'll come back and she won't.
- What does that mean?
- She'll come back as she was at the beginning... the first visit. She will simply not know anything, or, to be strict, she will act as if all the things you've pulled to get rid of her never happened. If you don't force her with a situation, she won't be aggressive. . - What situation?
- It depends on the circumstances.
- Snaut!
- What do you mean?
- We cannot afford the luxury of concealment!
- It's not a luxury - he interrupted me dryly. - Kelvin, I get the feeling that you still don't understand .... or, wait!
His eyes shone.
- Can you tell who was here?
I swallowed my saliva. I lowered my head. I didn't want to look at him. I would have preferred it to be someone else, not him. But I had no choice. A patch of gauze peeled away and fell onto my hand. I shuddered from the slippery touch.
- The woman I... I didn't finish.
- She had killed herself. She made herself... Injected... Waited.
- She committed suicide...? - he asked, seeing that I was silent.
- Yes.
- Is that all? I remained silent.
- That can't be all... I raised my head quickly. He wasn't looking at me.
- How do you know? He didn't answer.
- Good - I said. I licked my lips. - We had an argument. Or actually we didn't. I was the one who told her, you know, how one speaks in anger. I took my mannequins and moved out, she let me know, she didn't say it directly, but when you live with someone for years, you don't need it.... I was sure she was just saying that - that she would have been afraid to do it and it I told her too. The other day I remembered that I had left those injections; she knew about them - I had brought them from the lab, I needed them - I told her then what the effect was. I got scared and wanted to go and get them, but then I thought it would look like I took her words seriously, and I I left it at that, but on the third day however I went, it didn't give me a break. Already... when I came, she was already dead.
- Ah, you innocent boy....
It made me tear up. But when I looked at him, I realised he wasn't mocking. I saw him as if for the first time. His face was grey, unspeakable fatigue lay in the deep furrows of his cheeks, he looked like a man who was seriously ill.
- Why do you say that? - I asked, strangely intimidated.
- Because the story is tragic. No, no - he added quickly, seeing that I had moved - you still don't understand. Of course, you can take it the hardest, even have yourself killed, but.... that's not the worst of it.
- What are you saying! - I said derisively.
- I'm glad you don't believe me, really. What happened may be terrible, but the scariest thing is what didn't happen.... didn't happen. It never did.
- I don't understand... - I said weakly. I really didn't understand anything. He nodded his head. - A normal man,' he said. - What is a normal man? One who has never committed anything heinous? Yes, but did he never think about it? Or maybe he didn't even think about it, only something in him thought about it, grew up, ten or thirty years ago, maybe he defended himself against it and forgot it, and didn't fear it because he knew he would never put it into action. Yes, and now imagine that at once, in a full day, among other people, he meets TO embodied, chained to himself, indestructible, what then? What do you have then? I was silent.
- A station,' he said quietly. - You then have the Solaris Station.
- But... what could it be in the end? - I said hesitantly - you are not, after all, a criminal or a Sartorius....
- But you are a psychologist after all, Kelvin! - he interrupted me impatiently. - Who hasn't had a dream like that before? A swarming dream? Think of... of a fetishist who has fallen in love with, I don't know, a piece of dirty underwear, who, risking his skin, acquires by threat and request his dearest, loathsome rag, it must be funny, huh? Who at the same time abhors the object of his lust and goes mad for it and is prepared to risk his life for it to match, perhaps, Romeo's feelings for Juliet.... Such things do happen. True, but you probably understand that there must also be things .... situations... such that no one has dared to realise them, except in their own mind, in some single moment of bewilderment, collapse, madness, call it what you will. After which the word becomes flesh.
That's it.
- That's... All - I repeated senselessly, in a wooden voice. There was a rumble in my head. - But, but the Station? What has the Station got to do with it?
- You must be pretending - he muttered. He looked at me investigatively. - After all, I'm still talking about Solaris, only Solaris, nothing else. Not my fault if it's so drastically different from your expectations.
Besides, you've been through enough to at least hear me out to the end.
We set off into space, prepared for everything, that is, for loneliness, for struggle, martyrdom and death. Out of modesty, we don't say it out loud, but we sometimes think to ourselves that we are great. Meanwhile, in the meantime, this is not all, and our readiness turns out to be a pose. We do not want to conquer the cosmos at all; we only want to extend the Earth to its limits. Some planets are to be desert like the Sahara, others icy like the pole or tropical like the Brazilian jungle. We are humane and noble, we do not want to conquer other races, we just want to pass on our values to them and take over their heritage in return. We think of ourselves as Knights of the Sacred Contact. This is the second falsehood. We are not looking for anyone but humans. We do not need other worlds. We need mirrors. We don't know what to do with other worlds. All we need is this one, and we are already choking on it. We want to find our own idealised image; these are supposed to be globs, civilisations more perfect than ours, in others we expect to find again the image of our primitive past. Meanwhile, on the other side there is something we do not accept, something we defend ourselves against, and yet we did not bring from Earth a mere distillate of virtues, a heroic statue of Man! We came here as we really are, and when the other side shows us this truth - the part of it that we are silent about - we cannot accept it!
- So what is it? - I asked, having listened to him patiently.
- What we wanted: contact with another civilisation. We have it, this contact! Exaggerated as if under a microscope, our own monstrous ugliness, our clownishness and shame!!!!
There was a trembling rage in his voice.
- Do you think, then, that it is ... ocean? That it is him? But why? Never mind the mechanism at the moment, but for God's sake, what for! Do you seriously think it wants to play with us? Or to punish us! This is just primitive demonology! A planet overrun by a very great devil who, to satisfy his vein of satanic humour, suggests succubi to the members of a scientific expedition! You yourself probably don't believe such finite idiocy!
- This devil is not so stupid at all," he muttered through his teeth. I looked at him surprised.
It occurred to me that he might have finally had a nervous breakdown, even if what was happening at the Station was not explained by madness. Reactive psychosis...? - it still flashed through my mind when, with almost no voice, he began to laugh quietly.
- Are you giving me a diagnosis? Wait a bit longer. In fact, you experienced it in such a mild form that you still don't know anything!
- Aha. The devil took pity on me - I chuckled. The conversation was beginning to bore me,
- What do you actually want? To tell you what plans x trillion metamorphic plasma are plotting against us? Perhaps none.
- What do you mean, none? - I asked stunned. Snaut was still smiling.
- You should know that science is only concerned with how things happen, not why things happen. How? Well, it started eight or nine days after that X-ray experiment. Maybe the ocean responded to the radiation with some other radiation, maybe it probed our brains with it and brought out some psychic torpor.
- Otorments?
That started to interest me.
- Well, yes, processes detached from. locked away, repressed, walled off, some inflammatory foci of memory. He treated them as a prescription, as a construction plan.... after all, you know how similar are the asymmetrical crystals of chromosomes and those nucleic connections of cerebrosides that are the substrate of memory processes.... Hereditary plasma is, after all, 'remembering' plasma. So it took it out of us, annotated it, and then, you know, what happened next. But why was this done? Bal In any case, not to destroy us. That would have come much easier to him. In general, with such technological freedom, he could have done almost anything, for example set up doubles for us.
- That's why you were so frightened the first night I came! - Yes. Anyway,' he added, 'maybe he did. How do you know if I am really the kindly old Rat who came here two years ago....
He began to laugh quietly, as if my stupor gave him God knows what satisfaction, but stopped immediately.
- 'No, no,' he muttered, 'and without that it's quite.... Maybe there are more differences, but I only know one: me with you can be killed.
- And them not?
- I don't advise you to try. A terrible spectacle!
- Nothing?
- I don't know. In any case, not with poison, knife, stryk....
- An atomic thrower?
- Would you try it?
- I don't know. If you know they're not people.
- When they are in a sense. Subjectively they are people. They are not at all aware of their... origin. Have you noticed that, I think?
- Yes. So... what's it like?
- They regenerate at an unheard of rate. At an impossible rate, right in front of your eyes, I tell you, and they start acting all over again like.... like...
- Like what?
- Like our ideas about them, those memory records according to which....
- Yes. That's right - I fixed it. I didn't mind the ointment running down my burnt cheeks and dripping onto my hands.
- Did Gibarian know...? - I asked suddenly. He looked at me carefully.
- Did he know what we knew?
- Yes.
- Almost certainly.
- How do you know, did he tell you?
- No. But I found a certain book at his place....
- "The Little Apocrypha!" - I exclaimed, picking myself up from my seat.
- 'Yes. And how can you know about it? - he asked with sudden concern, plunging his pupils into my face. I made a contradictory movement with my head.
- 'Relax,' I said. - You can see, after all, that I am burned and not regenerating at all. There was a letter for me in the cabin.
- What are you saying! A letter? What was in it?
- Not much. Actually a note, not a letter. A bibliographical reference to the Solarian appendix, to this "Apocrypha". What is it?
- An old thing. Possibly has something to do with it. Here.
He pulled a leather-bound, corner-worn, thin volume out of his pocket and handed it to me.
- And Sartorius...? - I chuckled while hiding the book.
- What Sartorius? Everyone behaves in such a situation as .... he can. He tries to be normal - with him that means official.
- Well, you know!
- But yes. I was in a situation with him once, less about the details, enough that we were left with eight five hundred kilos of oxygen. One by one we dropped our daily activities, by the end we were all walking around bearded, he was the one shaving, cleaning his shoes, he's that kind of man. Naturally, whatever he does now will be a pretense, a comedy or a crime.
- Crime?
- Then not a crime. We need to invent a new word for it. For example, jet divorce'. Does it sound better?
- You are remarkably witty,' I said.
- Would you rather I cried? Suggest something.
- Ah, give me a break.
- No, I'm serious: you now know more or less as much as I do. Do you have a plan?
- You're good! I don't know what I'm going to do when...- he turns up again, he has to turn up?
- Rather, yes.
- Which way do they actually get in, after all the Station is airtight. Maybe the armour...
He shook his head negatively.
- The armour is fine. I have no idea how, we usually have visitors when we wake up, and eventually you have to sleep from time to time.
- Any closure?
- It helps for a short time. Remedies remain, well, you know what they are. He got up. And I got up.
- Look here, Snaut... You're all about liquidating the Station, only you want it to come from me?
He shook his head.
- It's not that simple. Naturally, we can always escape, if only to the Sateloid, and broadcast an SOS from there. They'll treat us, it's understood, as if we're insane - some sort of sanatorium on Earth until we call it all off nicely - there are, after all, incidents of collective insanity on such isolated outposts.... That wouldn't be the worst thing, perhaps. The garden, the tranquillity, the white rooms, the walks with the nurses....
He spoke quite seriously, with his hands in his pockets, gazing with unseeing eyes into a corner of the room. The red sun had already disappeared behind the horizon and the fringed waves melted into an inked desert. The sky was on fire. Lilac-edged clouds flowed over this two-coloured landscape, indescribably bleak.
- So do you want to run away? Or not? Not yet? He smiled.
- Steadfast conqueror... you haven't tasted it yet so you wouldn't insist on it. It's not about what I want, it's about what is possible.
- What?
- That's what I don't know.
- So we stay here? Do you think there will be a middle ground....
He looked at me, scrawny, with the flaky skin of his face riddled with wrinkles.
- 'Who knows. Maybe it will pay off,' he said at last. - 'We're unlikely to find out anything about him, but maybe about us...'
He turned, picked up his papers and left. I wanted to stop him, but his open mouth made no sound. There was nothing to be done; I could only wait. I went to the window and looked out at the blood-black ocean, almost not seeing it. It occurred to me that I could lock myself in one of the airport rockets, but I didn't think seriously about it, it was too stupid; sooner or later I would have to leave, after all. I sat down by the window and took out the book Snaut had given me. The light was still sufficient, it turned the pages pink; the whole room was bitter red. It was - collected by a certain Otto Ravintzer, Master of Philosophy - articles and papers of generally unambiguous value. Every science is always accompanied by some kind of pseudo-science, its bizarre derangement in the minds of a certain type; astronomy has its caricaturist in astrology, chemistry once had one in alchemy, so it is understandable that the birth of solar science was accompanied by a veritable explosion of oddities of thought; Ravintzer's book was filled with this kind of spiritual nourishment, preceded - it must be loyally added - by an introduction from his pen in which he distanced himself from this panopticon. He simply believed, not without reason, that such a collection could be a valuable document of the times, both for the historian and for the psychologist of science. Berton's report occupied a prominent place in the book. It consisted of several parts. The first was a copy of his boarding book, very laconic.
From four o'clock to sixteen forty of the expedition's conventional time, the notes were laconic and negative.
Altitude 1,000 - or 1,200 - or 800 metres - nothing observed - ocean empty.
This was repeated several times.
Then at 16.40: Red fog lifts. Visibility 700 metres. Ocean empty.
O 17.00: Fog thickens, quiet, visibility 400 metres, with clearances. I descend to 200.
At 17.20: I am in the fog. Altitude 200, visibility 20-40 metres. Quiet. I ascend to 400. 17.45: Height 500. Fog bank to the horizon. In the fog - funnel-shaped holes through which the surface of the ocean seeps. Something is happening in them. I try to enter one of these funnels.
At 17.52: I see a kind of whirlpool - it throws up yellow foam. Surrounded by a wall of fog. Height 100.
I descend to 20.
That was the end of Berton's log book entry. Further down the so-called report was an extract from his medical history, or to be more precise, it was the text of a statement dictated by Berton and punctuated by questions from committee members.
"Berton: When I descended to thirty metres, maintaining altitude became difficult because there were gusty winds in this circular, fog-free space. I had to put my weight on the rudders and so I didn't look out of the gondola for a while - maybe 10 or 15 minutes. As a result, I inadvertently entered the fog, carried into it by a strong gust. It wasn't ordinary fog, but a sort of suspension, colloidal, I think, because it sloughed off all my windows. I had a lot of trouble clearing them. It was very sticky. Meanwhile, it reduced my revs by thirty-odd per cent as a result of the drag that this sort of fog was putting on the propeller, so that I began to lose altitude. As I was very low and feared that I would drift on the wave, I gave full throttle. The machine maintained altitude, but upwards it was not going. I still had four patrons of rocket accelerators. I did not use them with the thought that the situation might get worse and I would need them then. At full speed there was a very strong vibration; I guessed that the propeller was sloshing around with this strange slurry; however, I still had zero on the lift clocks, so there was nothing I could do about it. I hadn't seen the sun since I entered the fog, but it was phosphorescing red in its direction. I kept circling in the hope that eventually I would be able to fall out into one of those fog-free areas, and indeed I did, about half an hour later. I flew out into a free space, almost exactly circular, several hundred metres in diameter. Its boundary was fog billowing violently, as if lifted by strong convection currents. I therefore tried to stay as much as possible in the centre of the "hole". - there the air was calmest. I then noticed a change in the surface of the ocean. The waves disappeared almost completely, and the superficial layer of this liquid - what the ocean is made of - became semi-transparent, with smokes that faded away until, after a short time, it was completely clarified and I could look into the depths through a layer that was probably several metres thick. It was as if a yellow slime had accumulated there, which moved upwards in thin, vertical streaks, and when it came to the surface, it became glassy and shiny, began to bubble and foam and thickened; it was then similar to a very thick, burnt sugar syrup. This slime or mucus would gather into thick knots, grow above the surface, form ka-lafioroval heights and slowly form various shapes. It began to pull me towards the wall of mist, so I had to parry this movement with turns and rudders for a few minutes, and when I could look out again, down below me, I saw something that resembled a garden. Yes, a garden. I saw dwarf trees and hedges, and paths, untrue - all of it made of the same substance that had pretty much solidified like yellowish plaster. That's what it looked like; the surface glistened heavily, I lowered myself as far as I could to inspect it carefully.
Question: did those trees and other plants you saw have leaves?
Berton's answer: No. It was just this general shape - sort of like a model of a garden. Oh, yes! Model. That's what it looked like. A model, but probably life-size. After a while, everything began to crack and split, a thick mucus squeezed to the surface in waves through the cracks, which were completely black, and solidified, some of it dribbling away and some of it staying, and everything began to agitate more and more vigorously, covered itself in foam and I could no longer see anything but it. At the same time, the fog began to squeeze me from all sides, so I increased the speed and went out to 300 metres.
Question: are you absolutely sure that what you saw resembled a garden - and nothing else? Berton's answer: Yes. That's because I noticed various details there; I remember, for example, that in one place there were square boxes standing in a row, as it were. Later it occurred to me that it could have been an apiary.
Question: later it occurred to you? But not at the time you saw it?
Berton's answer: No, because it was all like a plaster. And I saw other things.
Question: what kind of things?
Berton's answer: I can't say which ones, because I didn't manage to see them in detail. I got the impression that there were some tools lying under some bushes, they were sub-long-winded shapes with protruding teeth like plaster casts of small gardening machines. But of this I am not quite sure. That one, yes.
Question: didn't you think it was a hallucination?
Berton's answer: No. I thought it was a fatamorgan. I didn't think of a hallucination because I felt completely fine, and also because I had never seen anything like it in my life. When I got up to three hundred metres, the fog was riddled with depressions below me, it looked just like cheese. Some of these holes were empty and I could see the ocean rippling in them, while in others something was churning. I went down into one such place and at forty metres I saw that beneath the surface of the ocean - but quite shallow - lay a wall, as if the wall of a very large building; it shone brightly through the waves and had rows of regular, rectangular openings, like windows; and it even seemed to me that something was moving in some of the windows. Of this I am no longer quite sure. This wall began to slowly rise and emerge from the ocean. It was dripping with mucus in whole waterfalls and some kind of slimy formations, such veined thickening. Suddenly it split in two and went into the depths so fast that it disappeared immediately. I pulled the machine up again and flew just above the fog itself, that I was almost touching it with my undercarriage. I saw another empty funnel - it was probably several times bigger than the first one.
Already from a distance I saw something floating, it seemed to me, because it was bright, almost white, that it was a Fechner suit, especially as the shape resembled a human being. I made a turn with the machine, very abruptly, I was afraid that I might pass the place and not find it again; this figure then rose slightly and it looked as if it were swimming or standing up to its waist in a wave. I was in a hurry and went so low that I felt the impact of the undercarriage against something soft, the crest of a wave, I suppose, as there was a sizeable one at this point. The man, yes, it was a man, was not wearing a wetsuit. Nevertheless, he was moving. Question: did you see his face? Berton's answer: Yes. Question: Who was it? Berton's answer: It was a child. Question: what kind of child? Did you ever see them anywhere in your life?
Berton's answer: No. Never. At any rate, I don't recall. Anyway, as soon as I got closer - I was about forty metres away from it, maybe a bit more - I realised there was something wrong with it. Question: What do you mean by that? Berton's answer: I'll tell you right away. I didn't know what it was at first. Only after a while did I realise: it was unusually huge. Huge is an understatement. It was perhaps four metres long. I remember exactly that when I hit the undercarriage on the wave, its face was slightly above mine, and even though I was sitting in the cabin, I must have been about three metres above the surface of the ocean.
Question: if it was that big, how did you know it was a baby?
Berton's answer: Because it was a very small child.
Question: Don't you think, Berton, that your answer is illogical?
Berton's answer: No. Not at all. Because I saw his face. And anyway, the proportions of the body were childlike. It looked to me like... almost like a baby. No, that's an exaggeration. Maybe it was two or three years old. It had black hair and blue eyes, huge! And it was naked. Completely naked; like a newborn. It was, wet, or rather slippery, its skin so shiny.
This sight affected me terribly. I no longer believed in any fatamorgan. I could see it too closely. It was rising and falling according to the movement of the wave, but moving regardless, it was awful!
Question: why? What was it doing?
Berton's answer: It looked, well, like in some museum, like a doll, but like a living doll.
It opened and closed its mouth and made all sorts of movements, repulsive. Yes, because these were not its movements.
Question: how do you understand this?
Berton's answer: I didn't get more than a dozen metres closer to it, twenty would perhaps be the most appropriate assessment.
But I have already said how huge it was, and as a result I could see it extremely accurately. Its eyes were shining and in general it gave the impression of a living child, just these movements, as if someone was trying them out.... as if someone was trying them out...
Question: Try to explain further what this means.
Berton's answer: I don't know if I will succeed. I had this impression. It was intuitive.
I didn't think about it. These movements were unnatural.
Question: do you mean to say that, let's say, the hands moved in a way that human hands cannot move because of the limitations of mobility in the joints?
Berton's answer: No. Not at all. Just. these movements did not make any sense. Every movement generally means something, serves something....
Question: do you think so? The movements of an infant don't necessarily mean anything.
Berton's answer: I know that. But the movements of an infant are disorderly, uncoordinated. Generalised. And these were, a, I know! They were methodical. They took place one at a time, in groups and in series. As if one wanted to explore what this child was able to do with his hands, and what with his torso and mouth, with the face was the worst, I suppose because the face expresses the most, and this one was, like a face.... no, I don't know how to call it. It was alive, yes, but still not human. I mean the features as much as possible, and the eyes, and the complexion, and everything, but the expression, the facial expressions, no.
Question: were these grimaces? Do you know what a human face looks like in an epileptic attack? Berton's answer: Yes. I have seen such an attack. I understand. No, it was something else. In epilepsy there are spasms and convulsions, and these were movements that were most fluid and continuous, graceful, or as you would say, melodious. I have no other term for it. And again the face, with the face it was the same thing. A face cannot look so that one half is happy and the other half sad, so that one part of it is threatening or afraid and the other part is triumphant or something like that; but with this child it was just like that. Also, all these movements and mimicry play took place with unheard-of speed. I was there for a very short time. Maybe ten seconds. I don't even know if ten. Question: And you want to say that you managed to see all this in such a short time? Anyway, how do you know how long it took, did you check it on your watch?
Berton's answer: No. I didn't check it on my watch, but I've been flying for sixteen years. In my profession you have to judge time to the nearest second, I mean moments, it's all about reflexes. This is needed when landing. A pilot who cannot, regardless of the circumstances, figure out whether a phenomenon lasts five seconds or ten will never be worth much. It is the same with observation. A person learns this with years, to grasp everything in the shortest possible time. Question: is that all you've seen? Berton's answer: No. But I don't remember the rest so precisely. I suppose the dose was too strong for me. I had, as it were, a congested brain. The fog started to descend and I had to go up. I had to, but I don't remember how or when I did it. For the first time in my life I nearly drifted. My hands were shaking so much that I couldn't hold the rudder properly. I seem to have shouted something and called Base, even though I knew there was no communication.
Question: did you try to get back then? Berton's answer: No. Because in the end, when I got out on the ceiling, I thought maybe there was a Fechner in one of those holes. I know, it sounds nonsensical. Nevertheless, that's what I thought. 'If these things are happening,' I thought, 'maybe I can find Fechner too.' So I decided to go into as many holes of mist as I could. But the third time I went up, after what I saw, I realised I couldn't do it. I couldn't. I have to say, this much is known. I got nauseous and vomited in the gondola. I did not know what that meant until now. I have never had nausea. Question: It was a symptom of poisoning, Berton. Berton's answer: Possibly. I don't know.
But what I saw the third time I didn't make it up, it wasn't caused by poisoning.
Question: How can you know that? Berton's answer: It was not a hallucination.
A hallucination is, after all, what my own brain produces, no? Question: yes.
Berton's answer: Well, that's what it was. And that's what he couldn't produce. I will never believe it. He wouldn't be capable of it.
Question: rather, tell us what it was, okay? Berton's answer: First I have to find out how what I have said so far will be treated. Question: What is the significance of that? Berton's answer: For me - fundamental. I have said that I saw something that I will never forget again. If the committee thinks that what I have said is at least one per cent probable, so that a proper study of this ocean should be started, I think, in that direction, then I will say anything. But if it is to be regarded by the committee as some maya of mine, I will say nothing. Question: why?
Berton's answer: Because the content of my hallucinations, even if they cry out for vengeance to heaven, is my private affair. The content of my experiences on Solaris, on the other hand, is not.
Question: does this mean that you refuse to give any further answers until the expedition's competent authorities have reached a decision?
Because I think you understand that the committee is not empowered to take an immediate decision. Berton's answer: Yes, sir." That was the end of the first protocol. There was still an extract from the second, written eleven days later.
"Chairman: ...taking all this into account, the committee, composed of three doctors, three biologists, one physicist, one engineer and the deputy leader of the expedition, came to the conviction that the accidents presented by Berton represent the content of a hallucinatory syndrome, running under the influence of the poisoning of the planet's atmosphere, with twilight symptoms accompanied by a stimulation of the associative zones of the cerebral cortex, and that nothing or almost nothing corresponded to these accidents in reality.
Berton: Excuse me. What does 'nothing or - almost nothing' mean? What is 'almost nothing'? How big is that?
Guido: I am not finished yet. Separately, a votum separatum was recorded from Dr Archibald Messenger, a doctor of physics, who declared that what Berton had recounted could, in his opinion, have happened in reality and was worthy of conscientious investigation. That is all.
Berton: I repeat the question from a moment ago. Guido: The matter is simple. "Almost nothing" means that certain real phenomena may have initiated your hallucinations, Berton. The most normal person might, during a windy night, take a moving bush for some sort of figure. Let alone on an alien planet, when the observer's mind is under the influence of poison. That doesn't faze you, Berton. What is your decision in relation to the above? Berton: I would first like to know what are the consequences of this vote of separation by Dr Messenger?
Guido: Practically none. It means that research in this direction will not be undertaken. Berton: Is what we say on the record?
The chairman: Yes.
Berton: In view of this, I would like to say that, in my opinion, the committee has failed not me - I don't count here - but the spirit of this expedition. As I said the first time, I will not answer any further questions. The chairman: Is that all? Berton: Yes. But I would like to see Dr Messenger. Is that possible? The chairman: Naturally." This was the end of the second protocol. At the bottom of the sheet was a note in small print stating that Dr Messenger had a nearly three-hour confidential conversation with Berton the following day, after which he addressed the Board of Experts, demanding that the pilot's testimony be re-investigated. He claimed that this was supported by new, additional data that Berton had provided him with, but which he would only be able to disclose once the Council had reached a positive decision. The Council, in the persons of Shannahan, Timolis and Trahier, ruled in the negative on this request, whereupon the matter was closed. - The book still contained a photocopy of one page of a letter found in Messenger's posthumous papers. It was probably a brief; Ravintzer was unable to ascertain whether this letter had been sent or what its implications were.
,,... its pyramidal dullness" - the text began. , "For the sake of their authority, the Council, and more specifically Shannahan and Timolis (because Trahier's vote does not count) have rejected my demands. I am now addressing the Institute directly, but you understand for yourself that this is only a powerless protest. Bound by words, I cannot unfortunately convey to you what Berton told me. The Council's decision was obviously influenced by the fact that a man without any scientific degree came with the revelation, although many a researcher could envy this pilot's acumen and talent for observation. Please give me the following data by reverse post:
1) Fechner's biography including his childhood,
2) everything you know about his family and family affairs; he is said to have orphaned a young child,
3) the topography of the town where he grew up.
I would still like to tell you what I think about all this. As you know, some time after the departure of Fechner and Carrucci, a spot appeared in the centre of the red sun which, with its corpuscular radiation, annihilated radio communications, and, according to the Sateloid, mainly in the southern hemisphere, i.e. where our Base was located. Fechner and Carrucci moved - of all the research groups - furthest away from the Base.
We had not observed such a thick persistent fog in complete silence until the day of the catastrophe during our entire stay on the planet.
I believe that what Berton saw was part of 'Operation Man', perpetrated by this viscous monster. The actual source of all the creations, perceived by Berton, was Fechner - his brain, in the course of some 'mental dissection' incomprehensible to us ; it was about experimental restoration, the reconstruction of some of the (probably most permanent) traces of his memory.
I know this sounds fantastic, I know I could be wrong. So I ask you to help me; I am currently on Alaric and will await your reply there.
Your A."
I could scarcely read, it had grown so dark, the book in my hand had gone grey, by the end the print was spilling out in my eyes, but the blank part of the page testified that I had reached the end of the story, which in the light of my own experiences I found very plausible. I turned towards the window. A deep purple stood there, with a few more clouds smouldering above the horizon, like a dying coal. The ocean, shrouded in darkness, was invisible. I could hear the faint furling of paper strips above the fans. The heated air with a faint taste of ozone stood dead. Absolute silence filled the entire Station. I thought there was nothing heroic about our decision - to stay. The period of heroic planetary struggles, of daring expeditions, of horrific deaths, such as the first victim of the Fechner ocean, had long since closed. I almost didn't care anymore who Snaut's or Sartorius' 'guest' was. After a while, I thought, we will cease to be ashamed and odosab- ious. If we can't get rid of the "guests", we will get used to them and live with them, and if their Creator changes the rules of the game, we will adapt to the new ones as well, although for a while we will chafe, hurl, and maybe even this one or that one will commit suicide, but eventually this future state will also reach its equilibrium. The room was filled with a darkness more and more earth-like. Already only the white shapes of the washroom and the mirror dispelled the darkness. I got up, found a wad of cotton wool on the shelf in the dark, washed my face with a moistened tampon and lay down on my back on the bed. Somewhere above me, similar to the fluttering of a moth, the whirring of a fan floated and quieted. I couldn't even see the window, everything was encompassed by blackness, a streak of an out-of-nowhere flowing glow hung before me, I don't know whether on the wall or far away, deep in the rounded desert. I remembered how I had been frightened the previous evening by the empty gaze of the solarian space and almost smiled. I wasn't afraid of him. I wasn't afraid of anything. I brought the wrist of my hand closer to my eyes. A phosphorescent garland of digits lit up the dial of my watch. The blue sun was about to rise in an hour. I relished the prevailing darkness, breathed deeply, empty, drained of all thought.
At one point, as I moved, I felt the flat shape of a tape recorder clinging to my hip. Right. Gibarian. His voice fixed in the reels. It didn't even occur to me to resurrect it, to listen to it. It was all I could do for him. I took out the tape recorder to hide it under the bed. I heard rustling and the faint creak of the door opening.
- Kris...? - came a soft voice, close to a whisper. - Are you here, Kris? It's so dark.
-It's nothing - I said. - Don't be afraid. Come here.
