I had burns on my face and hands. I remembered that when I was looking for a sleeping pill for Harey (I would laugh at my naivety now if I could), I noticed a jar of burn cream in the medicine cabinet, so I went to my room. I opened the door and in the red sunset light I saw that someone was sitting in the chair where Harey had been kneeling before. Fear paralyzed me, I jerked backwards in panic to run; it lasted a fraction of a second. The seated man lifted his head. It was Snaut. Crossed, his back to me (he was still wearing the same reagent-stained canvas pants) he was flipping through some papers. The whole sheaf of them lay on the table next to it. When he saw me, he put them all down and stared at me for a while, frowning over his lowered spectacles. Without a word, I went to the washroom, took a semi-liquid ointment from the first-aid kit and began to apply it to the most burned places on my forehead and cheeks. Fortunately, I was not very swollen, and my eyes, thanks to the fact that I squeezed my eyelids tightly, were saved. I pricked a few of the larger blisters on my temple and cheek with a sterile injection needle and squeezed out the serous fluid. Then I stuck two sheets of moistened gauze over my face. All the while, Snaut was watching me carefully. I ignored it. When I finally finished these procedures (and my face was burning more and more), I sat down in the other chair. I had to take Harey&#39;s dress off him first. It was a perfectly ordinary dress, apart from the story with a clasp that wasn&#39;t there. Snaut, hands folded on his pointed knee, watched my movements critically. - Well, shall we have a chat? he said as I sat down. I didn&#39;t answer, pressing down on the sheet of gauze that began to slide down my cheek. - We had guests, didn&#39;t we? &quot;Yes,&quot; I replied dryly. I had no desire to tune in to his tone. - And we got rid of? Wow, wow, you went about it impetuously. He touched the still flaky skin on his forehead. There were pink patches of fresh skin on it. I stared at them dumbfounded. Why hasn&#39;t Snaut and Sartorius&#39; so-called tan given me food for thought until now? All this time I thought it was from the sun - and no one sunbathes on Solaris... - But you started small, didn&#39;t you? he said, oblivious to the flash of sudden understanding that dawned on me. - Miscellaneous, narcotica, venena, free American - what? - What do you want? We can talk on equal terms. If you want to clown, you better go. &quot;Sometimes you&#39;re a clown involuntarily,&quot; he said. He looked up at me with narrowed eyes. &quot;You&#39;re not going to tell me you didn&#39;t use a rope or a hammer?&quot; Didn&#39;t you throw the inkwell like Luther? No? Hey - he grimaced - you are a real glory! Even the washroom is complete, you didn&#39;t try to smash your head at all, nothing, you didn&#39;t demolish the room at all, you just did it right away, smack, packed, fired, and it&#39;s done?! He looked at his watch. &quot;We should have about two or three hours then,&quot; he concluded. He looked at me, looked at me with an unpleasant smile, and went on: &quot;So you say you take me for a pig?&quot; &quot;For a finished pig,&quot; I agreed firmly. - Yes? Would you believe me if I told you? Would you believe a single word? I was silent. &quot;Gibarian had it happen first,&quot; he went on, still with that fake smirk. - He locked himself in his cabin and spoke only through the door. And we, guess what we said? I knew, but I preferred to remain silent. - Sure. We thought he was crazy. He told us a bit through the door, but not everything. Can you even guess why he concealed who was with him? Well, you already know: suum cuique. But he was a real explorer. He demanded that we give him a chance. - What chance? &quot;Well, I suppose he tried to classify it, sort it out, sort it out, worked nights.&quot; Do you know what he was doing? You sure know! &quot;These calculations,&quot; I said. - In the drawer. In the radio station. is it him? - Yes. But I didn&#39;t know anything about it then. - How long it took? - Hospitality? I guess a week. Conversations through the door. Well, what was going on there. We thought he was hallucinating and motorized. I was giving him scopolamine. - How is it... him!? - Yeah. He did, but not for himself. He experimented. That&#39;s how it went. -- And you...? - us? On the third day, we decided to get to him, to break the door, if there is no other way, we wanted to treat him out of goodness. - And... that&#39;s why! I snapped. _ Yes - And there... in that wardrobe... - Yes, dear boy. Yes. He didn&#39;t know that in the meantime we were also visited by guests. And we couldn&#39;t take care of him anymore. He didn&#39;t know about it. Now it&#39;s... it&#39;s kind of... routine. He said it so softly that I guessed the last word rather than heard it. &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t understand,&quot; I said. - Well, then, you must have heard. You yourself said you were eavesdropping. You must have heard two voices, so... - No. Only his voice, and even if there were incomprehensible murmurs, you understand that we attributed all of them to him... - Only him...? But... why? - I do not know. I do have a theory about it, though. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth rushing into it, especially since explaining this and that doesn&#39;t help. Yes. But you must have seen something yesterday, or you would have taken us both for madmen? - I thought I was crazy myself. - Ah yes? And you haven&#39;t seen anyone? - I saw. - Who?! His grimace was no longer a smirk. I stared at him for a long time before I replied, &quot;The... black one...&quot; He didn&#39;t speak, but his whole body, shrunken and bent forward, relaxed slightly. &quot;You could have warned me after all,&quot; I began, less confidently now. - I did warn you. - How! - In the only possible way. See, I didn&#39;t know who it would be! Nobody knew that, you can&#39;t know that... - Listen, Snaut, a few questions. You&#39;ve known it... for some time. Is this... that... what will become of her? &quot;You mean will he come back?&quot; - Yes. - He&#39;ll come back and he won&#39;t come back. - What does it mean? - She&#39;ll be back just like she was at the beginning of her... first visit. She just won&#39;t know anything, or to be more precise, she&#39;ll act as if everything you did to get rid of her never happened. If you don&#39;t force her to do so, she won&#39;t be aggressive. . - What situation? - It depends on the circumstances. - Snaut! - What do you mean? - We can&#39;t afford the luxury of concealment! &quot;It&#39;s not a luxury,&quot; he interrupted dryly. - Kelvin, I have a feeling you still don&#39;t understand... or, wait! His eyes flashed. - Can you tell who was here? I swallowed. I lowered my head. I didn&#39;t want to look at him. I wish it was someone else, not him. But I had no choice. A sheet of gauze peeled off and fell on my hand. I flinched at the slippery touch. - A woman who... I didn&#39;t finish. - She killed herself. She gave herself... injected... He waited. - She committed suicide...? he asked, seeing me silent. - Yes. - That&#39;s all? I was silent. - This can&#39;t be all... I looked up quickly. He didn&#39;t look at me. - How do you know? He did not answer. &quot;Okay,&quot; I said. I licked my lips. - We argued. Not really. I told her, you know how to speak in anger. I took my belongings and moved out, she made it clear, she didn&#39;t say it directly, but when you live with someone for years, it&#39;s not necessary ... I was sure that she only said that - that she would be afraid to do it and that ... too I told her. The next day I remembered that I had left these ... injections in the drawer; she knew about them - I brought them from the laboratory, I needed them - I told her then what the action was. I got scared and wanted to go get them, but then I thought it would look like I took her words seriously, and... I left it like that, but on the third day I went anyway, it didn&#39;t give me peace. Already... when I came, she was already dead. - Ah, you innocent boy... I was hooked. But when I looked at him, I realized that he was not mocking. I saw him for the first time. His face was grey, unspeakable fatigue lay in the deep furrows of his cheeks, he looked like a seriously ill man. - Why do you say that? I asked, strangely intimidated. Because this story is tragic. No, no,&#39; he added quickly, seeing me move, &#39;you still don&#39;t understand. Of course, you may have the hardest time, even consider yourself a killer, but... it&#39;s not the worst. - What are you talking about! I said mockingly. &quot;I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t believe me, really.&quot; What happened may be terrible, but the scariest thing is what... didn&#39;t happen. Never. &quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot; I said weakly. I really didn&#39;t understand anything. He nodded. &quot;A normal man,&quot; he said. - What is a normal person? One who has never done anything heinous? Yes, but has he never thought about it? Or maybe he didn&#39;t even think, but something inside him thought, swarmed, ten or thirty years ago, maybe he defended himself against it and forgot it, and he wasn&#39;t afraid of it, because he knew he would never put it into practice. Yes, now imagine that all at once, on a full day, among other people, he meets IT embodied, chained to himself, indestructible, what then? What do you have then? I was silent. &quot;The station,&quot; he said quietly. - Then you have the Solaris Station. - But... what could it possibly be? - I said hesitantly - you are not a criminal or Sartorius ... - But you are a psychologist, Kelvin! he interrupted me impatiently. Who hasn&#39;t had a dream like this before? Moonshine? Think of... a fetishist who fell in love, I know, with a piece of dirty underwear, who, risking his skin, obtained by threat and begging his dearest, disgusting rag, it must be fun, huh? Who at the same time abhors the object of his lust and is crazy about it and is ready to risk his life for it, perhaps matching Romeo&#39;s feelings for Juliet... Such things happen. True, but you understand that there must also be things... situations... such that no one has dared to bring them into existence, except in their mind, in some single moment of bewilderment, collapse, madness, call it what you will. Then the word becomes flesh. That&#39;s all. &quot;It&#39;s... everything,&quot; I repeated in a meaningless, wooden voice. My head was buzzing. - But, but the station? What&#39;s up with the station? &quot;You must be pretending,&quot; he murmured. He looked at me searchingly. - I&#39;m still talking about Solaris, only Solaris, nothing else. It&#39;s not my fault if it&#39;s so drastically different from your expectations. Besides, you&#39;ve been through enough to at least listen to me to the end. We go into space, prepared for everything, that is, for loneliness, for struggle, martyrdom and death. Out of modesty, we don&#39;t say it out loud, but sometimes we think we&#39;re great. Meanwhile, meanwhile, that&#39;s not all, and our readiness turns out to be a pose. We do not want to conquer space at all, we only want to extend the Earth to its limits. Some planets are supposed to be desert like the Sahara, others icy like the Pole or tropical like the Brazilian jungle. We are humane and noble, we don&#39;t want to conquer other races, we just want to pass on our values to them and take their heritage in return. We consider ourselves Knights of Sacred Contact. This is the second fake. We&#39;re not looking for anyone but humans. We don&#39;t need other worlds. We need mirrors. We don&#39;t know what to do with other worlds. One is enough and we&#39;re already choking on it. We want to find our own idealized image; these are supposed to be globes, civilizations more perfect than ours, in others we expect to find again the image of our primitive past. Meanwhile, on the other side, there is something we do not accept, against which we defend ourselves, and yet we did not bring only the distillate of virtues from Earth, the heroic statue of Man! We came here as we really are, and when the other side shows us this truth - the part of it that we keep silent about - we can&#39;t agree! - So what is it? I asked, listening patiently. &quot;What we wanted: contact with another civilization.&quot; We got him, that contact! Exaggerated as under a microscope, our own monstrous ugliness, our buffoonery and shame!!! There was rage in his voice. &quot;So you think it&#39;s... an ocean?&quot; That it&#39;s him? But why? Never mind the mechanism now, but for God&#39;s sake, why?! Do you seriously think he wants to play with us? Or punish us?! This is just primitive demonology! A planet controlled by a very big devil who, to satisfy his satanic humor, gives members of a scientific expedition succubus! You don&#39;t believe in such complete idiocy, do you? &quot;The devil isn&#39;t that stupid,&quot; he muttered through his teeth. I looked at him surprised. It occurred to me that he might have had a nervous breakdown after all, even if what was going on at the Station wasn&#39;t explained by madness. Reactive psychosis...? I shuddered as he chuckled softly. - Are you giving me a diagnosis? Wait some more. In fact, you&#39;ve experienced it so mildly that you still don&#39;t know anything! - I see. The devil took pity on me, I said. The conversation was starting to bore me, - What do you want? Let me tell you what plans x trillion metamorphic plasma have against us? Perhaps none. - How are none? I asked dumbfounded. Snaut was still smiling. “You should know that science only deals with how things happen, not why things happen. How? Well, it started eight or nine days after the x-ray experiment. Maybe the ocean responded to the radiation with some other radiation, maybe it probed our brains with it and extracted some psychic encapsulations from them. - Encapsulations? This started to interest me. - Well, processes detached from. the rest, closed in on themselves, repressed, walled up, some incendiary foci of memory. He took it as a recipe, as a blueprint ... you know how similar the asymmetric crystals of chromosomes and those nucleoside connections of cerebrosides that are the substrate of memory processes ... Hereditary plasma is, after all, a &quot;memory&quot; plasma. He wrote us down, and then, you know what happened next. But why was it done? Prom. Not to destroy us, anyway. It would have been much easier for him. In general, with such technological freedom, he could pretty much do anything &quot;Ah!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;that&#39;s why you were so frightened the first evening I came in!&quot; two years ago... He started to laugh softly, as if my stupor gave him God knows what satisfaction, but then he stopped. there are more, but I know only one: I can be killed with you. - And not them? - I don&#39;t advise you to try. A terrible spectacle! - Nothing? - I do not know. At least not with poison, knife, noose... - A nuclear blaster? - Would you try? - I do not know. If you know they&#39;re not people. - When they are in a way. They are subjectively human. They are not even aware of their... origin. Have you noticed it? - Yes. So... how is it? - They regenerate at an incredible rate. At an impossible rate, in front of my eyes, I tell you, and they start acting like... like... - Like what? - Like our ideas about them, those memory records according to which... - Yes. It&#39;s true, I confirmed. I didn&#39;t care that the ointment ran down my burned cheeks and onto my hands. - Did Gibarian know...? I asked suddenly. He looked at me carefully. - Did he know what we knew? - Yes. - Almost certainly. - How do you know he told you? - No. But I found a book with him... &quot;The Little Apocrypha?&quot; I cried, jumping up. &quot;Yes. How do you know that?&quot; &quot;Calm down,&quot; I said, &quot;You can see I&#39;m burned and not recovering at all. There was a letter for me in the cabin.&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?! Letter? What was in it?&quot; to the Solaria annex, to this Apocrypha. What is this? - Old thing. It&#39;s possible it has something to do with it. You have. He pulled a thin leather-bound volume, worn at the corners, from his pocket and handed it to me. - And Sartorius...? I threw the book away. - What Sartorius? Everyone behaves in such a situation as ... he can. He tries to be normal - with him that means official. - Well, you know! - Of course. I was with him once in a situation, never mind the details, enough that we had eight five hundred kilograms of oxygen left. One by one we quit our daily activities, by the end we were all bearded, he was the only one shaving, polishing his shoes, he&#39;s such a man. Naturally, whatever he does now will be make-believe, comedy or crime. - A crime? So not a crime. We have to come up with a new word for it. Like, jet-set divorce.&quot; Sounds better?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re extremely witty,&quot; I said. &quot;Would you like me to cry? Suggest something.&quot; &quot;Oh, leave me alone.&quot; &quot;No, seriously, you know about as much as I do now. plan?&quot; &quot;Are you good! I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do when ..-&quot; he shows up again, he has to show up?&quot; &quot;More like that.&quot; &quot;How do they get inside, after all, the station is airtight. Maybe the armor...&quot; He shook his head. &quot;The armor&#39;s fine. I have no idea how, most of the time we have visitors after waking up, and then you have to sleep from time to time.&quot; &quot;Look here, Snaut... You mean taking down the station, but you want it to come from me?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s not that simple. Of course, we can always run away, even to a satellite, and send an SOS from there. They&#39;ll treat us , of course, like madmen - some sanatorium on Earth, until we cancel everything nicely - after all, there are cases of collective madness in such isolated facilities ... It would not be the worst, perhaps. The garden, the peace, the white rooms, the walks with the nurses... He spoke quite seriously, hands in his pockets, staring with unseeing eyes into the corner of the room. The red sun had already disappeared over the horizon and the crested waves had melted into an inky desert. The sky was on fire. Above this two-colored landscape, indescribably gloomy, lilac-edged clouds floated. - So you want to run away? Or not? Not yet? He smiled. - Indomitable conqueror... you haven&#39;t tasted it yet or you wouldn&#39;t insist so. It&#39;s not about what I want, it&#39;s about what is possible. - What? - That&#39;s what I don&#39;t know. - So we&#39;re staying here? You think there&#39;s a middle ground... He looked at me, skinny, his face scaly and furrowed. - Who knows. Maybe it will pay off, he said finally. &quot;We won&#39;t know anything about him, but maybe about us...&quot; He turned around, picked up his papers and left. I wanted to stop him, but my open mouth made no sound. There was nothing to do; I could only wait. I walked over to the window and stared out at the blood-black ocean, barely seeing it. It occurred to me that I could lock myself in one of the rockets at the airport, but I didn&#39;t mean it seriously, it was too stupid; I&#39;d have to leave sooner or later. I sat down by the window and took out the book that Snaut had given me. There was still enough light, it turned the pages pink, the whole room glowed red. These were - collected by a certain Otto Ravintzer, Master of Philosophy - articles and works of generally unequivocal value. Every science is always accompanied by some pseudo-science, its bizarre distortion in certain types of minds; astronomy has its caricaturist in astrology, chemistry once had it in alchemy, so it is understandable that the birth of solaristics was accompanied by a veritable explosion of mental freaks; Ravintzer&#39;s book was filled with this kind of spiritual nourishment, preceded, moreover, it must be added loyally, by an introduction by his pen in which he distanced himself from that panopticum. He simply believed, not without reason, that such a collection could be a valuable document of time, both for a historian and a psychologist of science. Berton&#39;s report featured prominently in the book. It consisted of several parts. The first was a copy of his log book, very laconic. From 2 pm to 4:40 pm, the conventional time of the expedition, the notes were laconic and negative. Altitude 1000 - or 1200 - or 800 meters - nothing observed - empty ocean. This was repeated several times. Then at 4:40 p.m.: A red mist rises. Visibility 700 meters. An empty ocean. At 17.00: Fog thickens, silence, visibility 400 meters, with clear spells. I go down to 200. At 5:20 PM: I&#39;m in fog. Altitude 200. Visibility 20-40 meters. Silence. Ascending 400. At 5.45 pm: Altitude 500. Shoal of fog to the horizon. In the fog - funnel-shaped openings through which the surface of the ocean rubs. Something is happening in them. I&#39;m trying to enter one of these sinkholes. At 5.52pm: I see a kind of vortex - throwing up yellow foam. Surrounded by a wall of fog. Altitude 100. Going down to 20. That was the end of Berton&#39;s log book entry. The continuation of the so-called report was an excerpt from his medical history, or more precisely, the text of a confession dictated by Berton, interspersed with questions from committee members. “Berton: When I got down to thirty meters, it became difficult to maintain altitude because there were gusty winds in this circular, fog-free space. I had to apply myself to the controls, so for a while - maybe 10 or 15 minutes - I didn&#39;t look out of the gondola. As a result, I entered the mist unintentionally, a strong gust carried me into it. It was not an ordinary fog, but a kind of suspension, I think, colloidal, because it dragged all my windows. I had a lot of trouble cleaning them. It was very sticky. Meanwhile, my revs were reduced by thirty-odd percent due to the propeller&#39;s resistance to some kind of fog, so that I began to lose altitude. Since I was very low and I was afraid that I would capsize on the wave, I gave it full throttle. The plane maintained altitude but did not go up. I had four more rocket booster patrons. I didn&#39;t use them thinking things might get worse and I&#39;d need them then. At full speed, a very strong vibration was created; I guessed that the propeller was caked with this strange slurry; but the load gauges were still at zero, so there was nothing I could do about it. I hadn&#39;t seen the sun since I stepped into the mist, but it was phosphorescent red towards him. I kept circling, hoping to eventually make it to one of those fog-free places, and I did, about half an hour later. I flew into a free space, almost perfectly circular, several hundred meters in diameter. Its boundary was a mist swirling violently, as if carried away by strong convection currents. So I tried to stay in the center of the &quot;hole&quot; as much as possible - the air was calmest there. Then I noticed a change in the surface of the ocean. The waves had almost completely disappeared, and the surface layer of this liquid - what the ocean is made of - became semi-transparent, with smoke that was fading away, until after a short time it was completely clarified, and I could look down through a layer probably several meters thick, and there was a sort of yellow slime accumulating there, rising in thin, vertical streaks, and when it rose to the top, it became a glassy gleam, began to churn and it frothed and hardened, it was like a very thick, burnt sugar syrup then. This ooze or slime gathered in thick knots, rose above the surface, made cauliflower-like heights, and slowly formed various shapes. It began to pull me towards the wall of mist, so I had to parry the motion with spin and rudder for a few minutes, and when I could look again, below me, I saw what looked like a garden . Yes, garden. I saw stunted trees and hedges and paths, not real - all of the same substance that had already solidified like yellowish plaster. This is what it looked like; the surface shone brightly, and I lowered myself as far as I could to examine it closely. Question: Did those trees and other plants you saw have leaves? Berton&#39;s answer: No. It was just a general shape - like a model of a garden. Oh yes! Model. That&#39;s what it looked like. Model, but probably life-size. After a while everything began to crack and break, through the cracks that were completely black, thick mucus squeezed to the surface in waves and congealed, some dripping and some staying, and everything began to storm more and more vigorously, covered with foam and nothing but it I have not seen. At the same time, the fog began to squeeze me from all sides, so I increased my revs and went out to 300 meters. Question: Are you absolutely sure that what you saw was like a garden - and nothing else? Berton&#39;s answer: Yes. Because I noticed various details there; I remember, for example, that in one place there were sort of square boxes standing in a row. Then it occurred to me that it could be an apiary. Question: Did it occur to you later? But not the moment you saw it? Berton&#39;s answer: No, because it was all made of plaster. And I saw other things. Question: What things? Berton&#39;s answer: I can&#39;t say which ones, because I haven&#39;t had time to watch them. I got the impression that there were some tools lying under a few bushes, they were oblong shapes with protruding teeth like plaster casts of small gardening machines. But I&#39;m not quite sure of that. That one - yes. Question: Didn&#39;t you think it was a hallucination? Berton&#39;s answer: No. I thought it was a mirage. I didn&#39;t think about hallucinating because I felt perfectly fine, and also because I had never seen anything like it in my life. When I got three hundred meters, the mist was riddled with pits beneath me, it looked just like cheese. Some of these holes were empty and I could see the ocean rippling through them, and others were seething. I went down to one of these places, and at forty meters I saw that under the surface of the ocean - but quite shallow - lies a wall, as if the wall of a very large building; it shone brightly through the waves and had rows of regular rectangular openings like windows; and it even seemed to me that in some windows something was moving. I&#39;m not quite sure about that anymore. This wall began to slowly rise and emerge from the ocean. Mucus was dripping down it in waterfalls and slimy formations, veined densities. Suddenly it broke in two and went in so fast that it immediately disappeared. I pulled the plane up again and flew so close to the fog that the undercarriage was almost touching it. I saw another empty funnel-shaped space - it was probably several times larger than the first. Already from a distance I saw something floating, it seemed to me, because it was clear, almost white, that it was Fechner&#39;s suit, especially since the shape resembled a man. I turned the machine very sharply, I was afraid that I might miss this place and not find it again; the figure lifted slightly then, and looked as if it were swimming or standing waist-deep in a wave. I was in a hurry and got so low that I felt the landing gear hit something soft, the crest of the wave, I suppose, because there was a lot of it there. The man, yes, he was a man, he wasn&#39;t wearing a suit. Still, he was moving. Question: Have you seen his face? Berton&#39;s answer: Yes. Question: Who was it? Berton&#39;s response: It was a baby. Question: What child? Have you ever seen them anywhere in your life? Berton&#39;s answer: No. Never. Anyway, I don&#39;t remember. Anyway, as soon as I got close - I was about forty meters away from him, maybe a little more - I realized that there was something wrong with him. Question: What do you mean by that? Berton&#39;s answer: I&#39;ll tell you right now. I didn&#39;t know what it was at first. It took me a while to realize: it was extraordinarily large. Huge is still an understatement. It must have been four meters. I remember clearly that when the landing gear hit the wave, his face was slightly above mine, and although I was in the cabin, I must have been three meters above the surface of the ocean. Question: If it was that big, how did you know it was a baby? Berton&#39;s answer: Because it was a very small child. Question: Don&#39;t you think, Berton, that your answer is illogical? Berton&#39;s answer: No. Not at all. Because I saw his face. And besides, the proportions of the body were childlike. He looked like... almost a baby. No, that&#39;s an exaggeration. Maybe it was two or three years old. He had black hair and blue eyes, huge! And it was naked. Completely naked; like newborn. It was wet, or rather slippery, his skin so shiny. The sight had a terrible effect on me. I no longer believed in any mirage. I saw them too closely. It rose and fell with the flow of the wave, but moved no matter what, it was disgusting! Question: Why? What was it doing? Berton&#39;s answer: It looked, well, like in a museum, like a doll, but like a living doll. It opened and closed its mouth and made all sorts of disgusting movements. Yes, because those weren&#39;t his moves. Question: How do you understand that? Berton&#39;s response: I didn&#39;t get closer than a dozen meters to it, twenty might be the best estimate. But I&#39;ve already told you how huge it was, and that allowed me to see it remarkably well. His eyes were sparkling, and he looked like a living child in general, only those movements, as if someone was trying ... as if someone was trying them ... Question: Please try to explain in more detail what it means. Berton&#39;s answer: I don&#39;t know if I can. I got that impression. It was intuitive. I didn&#39;t think about it. The movements were unnatural. Question: Are you saying that, for example, the hands moved in a way that human hands cannot, due to limited mobility in the joints? Berton&#39;s answer: No. Not at all. It&#39;s just... those moves didn&#39;t make any sense. Every move usually means something, serves a purpose... Question: Do you think so? Baby movements don&#39;t have to mean anything. Berton&#39;s answer: I know that. But the baby&#39;s movements are erratic, uncoordinated. Generalized. And those were, oh, I know! They were methodical. They took place sequentially, in groups and series. As if someone wanted to examine what this child is able to do with his hands, and what with his torso and mouth, the face was the worst, I suppose because the face expresses the most, and this one was like a face ... no, I can&#39;t name. She was alive, yes, but she wasn&#39;t human. I mean the features, and the eyes, and the complexion, and everything, but the expression, facial expressions, not. Question: Were they grimaces? Do you know what the face of a person in an epileptic attack looks like? Berton&#39;s answer: Yes. I saw such an attack. I see. No, it was something else. In epilepsy there are spasms and tremors, and these movements were perfectly smooth and continuous, graceful, or how to say melodious. I have no other term. And again the face, with the face was the same. A face can&#39;t look like half happy and the other half sad, half threatening or scared and the other triumphant or something like that; but that was the case with this child. Besides, all these movements and facial expressions were performed with incredible speed. I was there very briefly. Maybe ten seconds. I don&#39;t even know if ten. Question: And you mean to say you&#39;ve seen it all in such a short time? Anyway, how do you know how long it took, did you check it on your watch? Berton&#39;s answer: No. I didn&#39;t check my watch, but I&#39;ve been flying for sixteen years. In my profession you have to judge time to the second, I mean moments, it&#39;s all about reflexes. This is needed when landing. A pilot who can&#39;t tell whether a phenomenon lasts five seconds or ten, no matter what the circumstances, will never be worth much. It&#39;s the same with observation. Man learns it over the years, to grab everything in the shortest possible time. Question: Is this all you&#39;ve seen? Berton&#39;s answer: No. But I don&#39;t remember the rest so well. I suppose the dose was too strong for me. I had a kind of brain cork. The fog started to descend and I had to go up. I had to, but I don&#39;t remember how or when I did it. For the first time in my life, I nearly capped. My hands were shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t hold the rudder properly. I seem to have shouted something and called Base, though I knew there was no communication. Question: Did you try to go back then? Berton&#39;s answer: No. Because finally, when I climbed onto the ceiling, I thought maybe Fechner was in one of those holes. I know it sounds nonsensical. Still, that&#39;s what I thought. If such things happen, I thought, maybe I will be able to find Fechner. So I decided to go into as many fog holes as possible. But the third time I went up, after what I saw, I realized that I couldn&#39;t make it. I could not. I have to say it is obvious. I got nauseous and vomited in the gondola. I didn&#39;t know what that meant until now. I&#39;ve never been bored. Question: It was a symptom of poisoning, Berton. Berton&#39;s answer: Possible. I do not know. But what I saw the third time I did not invent, it was not caused by poisoning. Question: How can you know about this? Berton&#39;s response: It wasn&#39;t a hallucination. A hallucination is what my own brain produces, right? Question: Yes. Berton&#39;s answer: Exactly. And he couldn&#39;t make it. I will never believe it. He wouldn&#39;t be able to do that. Question: Rather tell me what it was, okay? Berton&#39;s response: First, I need to know how what I&#39;ve said so far will be handled. Question: What does it matter? Berton&#39;s answer: For me - essential. I said I saw something I will never forget. If the committee decides that what I said is at least one percent probable, so that appropriate research of this ocean should be started, I think, in this direction, then I will say everything. But if this is to be considered by the committee as some ravings of mine, I won&#39;t say anything. Question: Why? Berton&#39;s answer: Because the content of my hallucinations, even if they cry out to heaven for vengeance, is my private business. But the content of my experience on Solaris - no. Question: Does this mean that you refuse to answer any further questions until a decision has been made by the proper authorities of the expedition? Because I think you understand that the committee is not authorized to make an immediate decision. Berton&#39;s answer: Yes, that was the end of the first protocol. There was also a fragment of the second, written eleven days later. &quot;Chairman: ...all things considered, a committee of three physicians, three biologists, one mechanical engineer and deputy leader of the expedition, came to the conclusion that the events presented by Berton constitute the content of a hallucinatory syndrome, proceeding under the influence of poisoning with the planet&#39;s atmosphere, with twilight symptoms accompanied by stimulation of the associative zones of the cerebral cortex, and that these or almost nothing. Berton: Excuse me. What does &#39;nothing or - almost nothing&#39; mean? What is &#39;almost nothing&#39;? How big is it? Conductor: I&#39;m not done yet. The votum separatum of physicist Archibald Messenger has been recorded separately. who stated that what Berton said could, in his opinion, happen in reality and is worthy of diligent examination. everything. Berton: I&#39;m repeating a question from a moment ago. Leader: It&#39;s simple. &quot;Almost nothing&quot; means that certain real phenomena may have triggered your hallucinations, Berton. The most normal person on a windy night might mistake a moving bush for a figure. What about on an alien planet when the observer&#39;s mind is under the influence of poison. That doesn&#39;t offend you, Berton. What is your decision in this regard? Berton: I would like to know first what are the consequences of Dr. Messenger&#39;s votum separatum? Guide: Virtually none. This means that research in this direction will not be undertaken. Berton: Is what we say recorded? Guide: Yes. Berton: Then I would like to say that, in my opinion, the commission failed not to me - I do not count here - but to the spirit of this expedition. As I said the first time, I will not answer further questions. Guide: Is that all? Bernton: Yes. But I&#39;d like to see Dr. Messenger. Is it possible? Leader: Naturally.&quot; That was the end of the second protocol. At the bottom of the sheet was a note in small print stating that Dr. Messenger had held a confidential conversation with Berton the next day for nearly three hours, and then turned to the Expedition Council, demanding that research on the the pilot&#39;s testimony, claiming that this was supported by new, additional data that Berton had provided to him, but which he would only be able to disclose after the Council had reached a positive decision. case closed • The book also contained a photocopy of one page of a letter found in Messenger&#39;s posthumous papers, which was probably a draft, and Ravintzer failed to determine whether the letter had been sent or what its consequences were. dullness,&quot; the text began. Concerned about their authority, the Council, specifically Shannahan and Timolis (because Trahier&#39;s vote does not count), rejected my demands. I am addressing the Institute directly now, but you understand that this is only a powerless protest. Bound by word, unfortunately I cannot tell you what Berton told me. Of course, the Council&#39;s decision was influenced by the fact that a man without any scientific degree came with the revelation, although many a researcher could envy this pilot&#39;s presence of mind and talent for observation. Please give me the following. data by return mail: 1) Fechner&#39;s biography, including his childhood, 2) everything you know about his family and family matters; supposedly orphaned a small child, 3) the topography of the town where he grew up. I would like to tell you what I think about all this. As you know, some time after the departure of Fechner and Carucci, a spot appeared in the center of the red sun, which destroyed radio communication with its corpuscular radiation, and according to the Sateloid data, mainly in the southern hemisphere, i.e. where our Base was located. Fechner and Carrucci were the furthest away from Base of all research groups. We did not observe such a thick, persistently resting fog with complete silence until the day of the catastrophe, for the entire time we were on the planet. I believe what Berton saw was part of &quot;Operation Man&quot; by that sticky monster. The actual source of all the creations noticed by Berton was Fechner - his brain, during some incomprehensible to us »psychological dissection; it was about experimental reconstruction, about reconstructing some (probably the most lasting) traces of his memory. I know it sounds fantastic, I know I could be wrong. So I am asking you for help; I am presently on Alaric, and there I shall await your reply. Your A.&quot; I could barely read, it was so dark, the book turned gray in my hand, and at the end the print began to fall apart before my eyes, but the blank part of the page showed that I had come to the end of this story, which in the light of my own experience I considered very likely. I turned to the window. There was a deep purple in it, a few clouds still smoldering on the horizon like dying coals. The ocean, shrouded in darkness, was invisible. I could hear the faint flutter of paper strips above the fans. The heated air, faintly flavored with ozone, was dead. Absolute silence filled the entire station. I thought there was nothing heroic about our decision to stay. The period of heroic planetary struggles, daring expeditions, horrific deaths, such as Fechner&#39;s first ocean victim, was long over. I hardly cared who is the &quot;guest&quot; of Snaut or Sartorius. After a while, I thought, we&#39;ll stop being ashamed and isolated. If we can&#39;t get rid of the &quot;visitors,&quot; we&#39;ll get used to them and live with them, and if their Maker changes the rules of the game, we&#39;ll adapt to the new ones, though we&#39;ll prance and scurry for a while, and maybe even this or he will commit suicide, but eventually this future state will also come to its equilibrium. The room was filled with darkness more and more earth-like, only the white shapes of the washstand and the mirror illuminated the darkness. I lay down on my back on the bed, and somewhere above me, like the flutter of a moth, the whirr of a fan hovered and died away. or far away, in the desert beyond my window. I remembered how terrified I had been last night by the empty gaze of Solarian space, and I almost smiled. I wasn&#39;t afraid of him. I wasn&#39;t afraid of anything. I put my wrist close to my eyes. The dial of the watch lit up with a phosphorescent ring of numbers. The blue sun would rise in an hour. I savored the darkness, breathed deeply, empty, freed from all thought. At one point, as I moved, I felt the flat shape of a tape recorder pressed against my hip. Truth. Gibarian. His voice recorded on reels. It didn&#39;t even occur to me to resurrect him, to listen to him. It was all I could do for him. I took out the tape recorder to hide it under the bed. I heard a rustle and the faint creak of a door opening. - Chris...? A quiet voice, close to a whisper, sounded. - Are you here, Chris? so dark. &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; I said. - Do not be afraid. Come here.
