The next day, after lunch, I found a note from Snaut on my table: Sartorius had postponed the construction of the annihilator and was about to shoot a powerful beam of beams into the ocean one last time. “Harey, honey, I have to go see Snaut. The red dawn set the window ablaze and divided the room into two parts. We were standing in a region of blue shadow. Beyond this gray area, everything was copper; if a book had fallen from its shelf, my ear would have instinctively listened for a metallic ringing. “It&#39;s about this experience. Only, I don&#39;t know how to do it. You see, I would rather… I interrupted myself. &quot;Kris, you don&#39;t have to justify yourself!&quot; I would so… if it didn&#39;t last too long. “It will take some time. Look, do you think you could wait in the hallway? — I will try. What if I can&#39;t control myself? - What exactly do you feel? – I added, hastily: I&#39;m not questioning you out of indiscretion, don&#39;t get me wrong, but if we dig into the question a little, you might find a way to dominate yourself. &quot;I&#39;m scared,&quot; she said. “She had turned pale. “I can&#39;t even explain to you what I&#39;m afraid of, because in reality I&#39;m not afraid of anything or anyone. I…I feel lost. And I&#39;m terribly ashamed of myself. Then when you come back, it&#39;s over. That&#39;s why I thought it was a disease… She spoke in a low voice and she was shaking. &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s only in this cursed Station that you experience terrors.&quot; I&#39;ll arrange for us to leave quickly. She widened her eyes: - Do you think it&#39;s possible? - Why not ? I am not a prisoner here. I&#39;ll have to talk to Snaut. What do you think, how long can you be alone? - It depends ... - She lowered her head: If I hear your voice, I think I will manage not to move. &quot;I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t hear us. I have nothing to hide from you, but I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t know, what Snaut will say. - Do not continue, I understand. I will stay at a good distance, it will be enough that I recognize the sound of your voice. — I&#39;ll call him from the studio. I don&#39;t close the doors. Harey nodded. I crossed the red zone; by contrast, and despite the lamps, the corridor seemed dark to me. The door to the studio was open. Last traces left by the events of the night, the debris of the Deware bottle shone under a row of liquid oxygen tanks. When I lifted the handset, the small screen lit up; I dialed the number of the radio booth. Behind the matte glass, the film of bluish light burst; Leaning sideways over the arm of a chair, Snaut looked me in the eye. &quot;Hi,&quot; he said. - I found your ticket. I would like to talk to you. I can come ? - You can. Right away ? - Yes. - Excuse me, are you coming alone or ... accompanied? - Alone. Projecting forward his forehead lined with thick wrinkles, his thin, burnt cheeks, he studied me through the domed glass – a queer fish in a queer aquarium. He assumed a knowing look: &quot;Well, well, I&#39;ll be waiting for you.&quot; When I returned to my room, I vaguely made out Harey&#39;s silhouette beyond the curtain of red rays. - We can go, my dear ... - The voice failed me. Harey was sitting in an armchair, her arms folded under the armrests. Had she heard my footsteps too late? For a second, I saw her fight against the incomprehensible force that inhabited her, overcome this horrible contraction of her whole body and finally relax. A blind fury, mingled with pity, suffocated me. In silence, we followed the long corridor with polychrome walls – the diversity of colors, according to the architects, should make life easier for us inside the armored carapace. From a distance, I noticed that the door of the radio cabin was ajar and let a band of red light through. I looked at Harey, who didn&#39;t even try to smile; all the way she had been bracing herself for a fight with herself, and now that the ordeal was approaching she had a pale, emaciated face. Fifteen paces from the door, she stopped. I turned around; she nudged me with her fingertips. Immediately, Snaut, my projects, the experiment, the Station, everything seemed derisory to me, compared to the torture she was about to undergo. I did not feel a vocation as an assistant executioner; I wanted to retrace my steps. But a shadow cut the reflection of the sun on the wall and I hastened to enter the cabin. Snaut had moved towards the door, as if he had intended to come out to meet me. The solar disc haloed her with a purple glow, which seemed to radiate from her gray hair. We looked at each other for a moment without saying anything. If he could study me at his leisure, I didn&#39;t see him, for I was dazzled by the blaze from the window. I walked past Snaut and went to lean against a high desk, from which the flexible rods of the microphones emerged. Snaut turned slowly and continued to observe me with his usual smile, a grimace that did not express cheerfulness and most often betrayed unspeakable fatigue. His eyes still fixed on me, he made his way through the piles of objects piled up in disorder – thermal accumulators, instruments, spare parts for the radio installation. Approaching a metal cupboard, he straightened a stool and sat down, his back against the cupboard door. Worried, I strained my ears; no sound came from the hallway where I had left Harey. Why was Snaut silent? Our silence between them was becoming awkward. I cleared my throat: &quot;When will you be ready?&quot; — We could start today, but the recording takes some time. - The record ? You mean the encephalogram? - Yes, you agreed ... what is it? - No nothing. As the silence continued again, Snaut continued: &quot;Did you have something to tell me?&quot; I murmured: - She knows ... He frowned: - Ah? I had the impression that he was not really surprised. So why was he pretending to be surprised? I lost all desire to confide in him. Yet, out of sheer honesty, I forced myself to speak: &quot;She began to have suspicions since our conversation in the library, she spied on me, she added up the clues, then she found Gibarian&#39;s tape recorder and she listened to the tape… Leaning against the cupboard, he didn&#39;t move, but a faint sparkle brightened his eyes. Standing next to the desk, I had in front of me the panel of the half-open door to the hallway. I lowered my voice again: &#39;Last night, while I was sleeping, she tried to kill herself. She absorbed liquid oxygen… There was a rustle of papers driven by a current of air. I stopped talking, paying attention to what was going on in the hallway. The noise wasn&#39;t coming from the hallway, it was in the bedroom. A mouse… A mouse! Absurd. There were no mice here. Stealthily, I observed my companion. &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; he said quietly. - Of course, she did not succeed ... in any case, she knows who she is. &quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; At the same time, I did not know what to say, then I mumbled: - To inform you ... to find out about the situation ... - I warned you. Despite myself, I raised my voice: - You mean you knew ... - What you just told me? Of course not. But I explained the situation to you. When he arrives, the &quot;visitor&quot; is almost empty, he is only a ghost nourished by memories and confused images, drawn from his… Adam. The longer he stays with you, the more human he becomes. He also becomes more independent, up to a point. And the longer it lasts, the harder it gets… Snaut stopped, looked me up and down, and added reluctantly, She knows everything? - Yes, I have already told you. - All ? She knows she came a first time and you have ... - No! He smiled. “Listen, Kelvin, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re up to… What do you want to do, you want to leave the Station? - Yes. - With her ? - Yes. He was silent, pondering his answer, but his silence also meant something else… what? Again, I heard close to me – without being able to locate it and as if behind a thin wall – the rustling of an insensible current of air in the room. Snaut shifted on his stool. &quot;Very well,&quot; he said. What are you looking at me for? You thought I would put a spoke in your wheels? My dear Kelvin, you will do what you want. With the worries we have, we are not going to, on top of that, use coercion on each other! Without hoping to convince you, I want to tell you this: In an inhuman situation, you try to maintain a human behavior. It may be very beautiful, but it won&#39;t get you anywhere. Besides, I&#39;m not so sure that it&#39;s beautiful. How could stupid behavior be beautiful? That&#39;s not the question, let&#39;s get back to our business! You give up pursuing the experiments, you want to leave and take her with you, yes? - Yes. “It&#39;s also…an experience. Have you thought about it? - What do you mean ? You wonder if she… will be able?… As long as she&#39;s with me, I don&#39;t see… Speaking more and more slowly, I stopped in the middle of my sentence. Snaut sighed. &#39;We all have an ostrich policy, my dear Kelvin, and we know it. There is no need to put on chivalrous airs. “I don&#39;t put on any airs. &quot;Excuse me, I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. I withdraw the chivalrous airs, but I keep the ostrich politics, which you practice in a particularly dangerous form. You lie to yourself, you lie to her, to her, and you go around in circles. Do you know the conditions for stabilization of a neutrino structure? “No, and neither are you. Nobody knows them. - In effect. We only know that such a structure is unstable and can only survive through a continuous influx of energy. I learned it from Sartorius. This energy creates a swirling stabilizing field. Is this magnetic field external to the &quot;visitor&quot;, or is it created inside his body? Do you get the difference? “Yes…if he&#39;s outside…she…” Snaut concludes for me: “Away from Solaris, the structure crumbles. Pure hypothesis, of course, but which you can verify, since you have already tried an experiment. The rocket you launched... it continues to gravitate. In my spare time, I even calculated the elements of its movement. You can fly away, place yourself in orbit, approach you and see what has become of the passenger… I yelled: — You&#39;re crazy! &quot;Do you think so?... what if we brought this rocket back here?&quot; No problem, it is remote controlled. We&#39;ll knock it out of orbit and—” “Shut up! - No, you do not want either? There is one more way, very simple. It will not be necessary to bring it back to the Station, it will continue to gravitate. It will suffice to establish a radio link. If she lives, she will respond and… — But… but she hasn&#39;t had any oxygen for a long time! “Maybe she doesn&#39;t need oxygen. We try ? “Snaut…Snaut…” He mimicked me angrily: “Kelvin…Kelvin…Think a bit! Are you a man, yes or no? Who are you trying to please? Who do you want to save? You ? She ? And which of the two? This or that? You don&#39;t have enough courage to face them both? You see that your conduct is inconsiderate! I repeat it to you for the last time, we find ourselves in a situation which escapes morality. I heard the same rustle as before, and this time it seemed to me that fingernails were scratching a wall. Somehow, I suddenly felt as passive and indifferent as a mule. I saw myself, I saw the two of us from very far away, through the small end of a telescope, and everything seemed to me insignificant, negligible, a little laughable. I asked: - Well, and according to you, what should I do? Push him away? Tomorrow she would come back, wouldn&#39;t she? And the day after, and every day after. For how long ? What&#39;s the use of getting rid of it, if it comes back? What benefit will I get from it? And what advantage for you, for Sartorius, for the Station? - No, here&#39;s what I suggest: Go with her! You will witness the transformation. After a few minutes, you&#39;ll see ... Without enthusiasm, I interrupted: - What? A monster, a demon? “No, you&#39;ll just see her die. Do you really believe in his immortality? I assure you they die… What will you do then? Will you be coming back here… to restock? Clenching my fists, I shouted: “Shut up! Eyelids narrowed, he looked at me with a condescending mockery: - Ah, it&#39;s me who should be quiet? However, it was not me who started this conversation, and I think it has gone on long enough! I recommend other amusements. You could, for example, go whip the ocean with a rod, to get revenge on it! What do you imagine? That you&#39;re a scoundrel, if you ship him…” He waved his hand sardonically and looked up at the ceiling, as if his eyes were watching a rocket take off. &quot;And that you are an honest man, if you keep her?&quot; Smile when you feel like moaning, feigning joy and peace, when you want to bang your head against the wall, isn&#39;t that being a rascal? And if it is impossible, here, not to be a scoundrel? What are you going to do ? Go wild on that scoundrel Snaut, who&#39;s responsible for everything? Yes ? So, my dear Kelvin, it&#39;s because, to make matters worse, you really are a complete idiot! Chin down, I replied: - You speak for yourself ... me ... I love him. &quot;Who?... his memory?&quot; - Not her. I told you what she wanted to do. Few…genuine human beings would have had the courage to do so. - By your own words, you recognize ... - Do not quibble with me on the words! - Good. So she loves you. And you, you want to love him. It&#39;s not the same thing. - You&#39;re wrong. &#39;I&#39;m sorry, Kelvin, but it was you who told me your intimate concerns. You don&#39;t like him. You love it. She is ready to give her life. You also. It&#39;s very moving, it&#39;s magnificent, it&#39;s sublime, whatever you want. But here it&#39;s misplaced. This is not the place. You understand ? No, you refuse to understand it. Unknown forces, independent of us, draw you into a circular process, of which she is an aspect, a phase, a periodic manifestation. If she was… if you were bothered by a devoted maritorne, you wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a moment to send her away, would you? - In effect. - Well, that&#39;s probably why she is not a maritorne! Are your hands tied? That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about, that your hands are tied! “It&#39;s just a new hypothesis, added to a million other hypotheses listed in the library. Leave me alone, Snaut, she&#39;s… No, I don&#39;t want to talk to you about it anymore. - Good. You started it. Just remember that she is a mirror in which a part of your brain is reflected. If she&#39;s wonderful, it&#39;s because you have wonderful memories. You provided the recipe. You are caught in a circular process, do not forget it! - What do you want from me ? That I… that I take her away? I&#39;ve already asked you the question: Why?… You didn&#39;t answer. - I&#39;m going to answer you. I didn&#39;t want this conversation. I didn&#39;t meddle in your business. I don&#39;t order you anything, I don&#39;t forbid you anything, and even if I had the right, I wouldn&#39;t do it. You came here of your own free will and unpacked everything in front of me. You know why ? No ? To relieve you of a burden, to relieve you of a weight! Ah, my dear Kelvin, I know this burden. Oh, yes, and don&#39;t interrupt me! I leave you free of your decisions, whereas you wish an opposition. If I got in your way, you might try to beat me up. But you would have to deal with me, a man fashioned from the same slime as you, a man of the same flesh and blood as you, and then you too would feel like a man. As I don&#39;t give you the opportunity to fight, you argue with me… or rather, you argue with yourself! All you have to do is tell me that you would succumb to the pain, if it suddenly disappeared… No, please don&#39;t say anything! I replied awkwardly to her attack: - I came to inform you, by simple honesty, that I intend to leave the Station with her. Snaut shrugged: - You do not budge ... I expressed my opinion only because I see that you get your head. And the higher we rise, the harder the fall will be, as they say… Come tomorrow morning, around nine o&#39;clock, to Sartorius&#39;s… will you come? I was surprised: &quot;At Sartorius&#39;s?&quot; I thought he didn&#39;t let anyone in. You told me we couldn&#39;t even call him. “Looks like he worked it out somehow. We never talk about our domestic problems. You… it&#39;s entirely different. Are you coming tomorrow morning? I growled: &quot;I&#39;ll come.&quot; I was watching Snaut. His left hand had slipped inside the cupboard. Since when was the door ajar? For quite a long time, probably, but in the excitement of this horrible conversation I hadn&#39;t noticed anything. The position of this hand was not natural. It looked like he was hiding something. Or that he was holding someone&#39;s hand. I moistened my lips: - Snaut, what are you ... - Get out, he said in a low voice and very quietly, get out! I went out and closed the door on the last glimmers of red twilight. Ten paces from the door, Harey was waiting, sitting on the floor, glued to the wall. She jumped up: - You see, she said, looking at me with bright eyes. I did it, Kris… I&#39;m so happy! Maybe ... it may be easier and easier ... I replied absently: - Oh, yes, surely ... We went home. I kept worrying about that closet. So that was where he was hiding?... And all our conversation?... My cheeks were starting to burn so badly that I involuntarily caressed them with the back of my hand. What a stupid conversation! And to achieve what? To nothing. Ah, yes, tomorrow morning… Suddenly, fear seized me, a fear similar to that which I had experienced the night before. My encephalogram. The entire recording of my brain processes, transformed into a beam of rays, would be discharged into the ocean, into the depths of this inconceivable, infinite monster... What had Snaut said: &quot;If she disappeared, you would suffer horribly?&quot; An encephalogram is a recording of all processes – conscious and unconscious processes. If I wish it to disappear, will it disappear? But if I wanted to get rid of her, would I be so afraid of the annihilation that threatened her? Am I responsible for my unconscious? But who else would be responsible for it?… What nonsense! Why did I agree to give them my encephalogram… Of course, I can study the recording before allowing it to be used, but I won&#39;t be able to decipher it. No one can decipher it. Specialists can only circumscribe the subject&#39;s thoughts in general terms. They will say, for example, that the subject was meditating on the solution of a mathematical problem, but will be unable to specify the data of this problem. They are forced to stick to generalities, they assert, because the encephalogram reproduces pell-mell a multitude of processes taking place simultaneously, and of which only a part has a psychic “double”. What about unconscious processes? Specialists absolutely refuse to talk about it. How to demand, therefore, that they decipher more or less repressed memories… But what am I so afraid of? I told Harey this very morning that the experiment will not work. If our neurophysiologists are incapable of deciphering the recording, how could this stranger, this black and fluid giant, be able to do so? Yet he penetrated me, without my knowledge; he probed my memory and he discovered my most sensitive point. How can you doubt it? Without any help, without any &#39;beam transmission&#39;, he broke through the hermetic shielding, the double shell of the Station, he found me and he took his loot… “Kris? Harey whispered. Standing in front of the window, staring, I hadn&#39;t seen night coming. A thin ceiling of high clouds, a silver cupola faintly reflecting the vanished sun, veiled the stars. If she disappears after the experience, it will mean that I wanted her gone. That I killed her. No, I will not go up to Sartorius. I don&#39;t have to obey them. What will I tell them? The truth ? No. I can&#39;t tell them the truth. It will be necessary to play the comedy, to lie, again and again… Because there are perhaps in me thoughts, intentions, cruel hopes of which I know nothing, because I am an assassin who ignores himself. Man has set out to discover other worlds, other civilizations, without having fully explored his own abysses, his labyrinth of dark corridors and secret chambers, without having pierced the mystery of the doors he himself has condemned. Abandon them Harey… out of modesty? Give it up just because I lack courage? “Kris,” Harey said, lower still. She had approached me. I pretended not to have heard her. At this moment, I wanted to isolate myself. I had to isolate myself. I hadn&#39;t decided anything yet, taken any resolution. Motionless, I contemplated the black sky, the cold stars, pale ghosts of the stars that shone above the Earth. My head was suddenly emptied of all thoughts. All I had left was the gloomy certainty of having irremediably crossed a border. Indifferent, I refused to know that I was walking towards the inaccessible and I no longer even had the strength to despise myself.
