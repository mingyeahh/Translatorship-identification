Hastily pocketing Gibarian&#39;s notes, I approached the closet: coveralls and other clothing had been pushed aside, squeezed aside, as if a man had taken refuge in the back of the closet. From the avalanche of papers on the floor emerged the corner of an envelope. I picked it up. It was addressed to me. My throat dry, I tore open the envelope; I had to make an effort to decide to unfold the sheet it contained. In his regular, perfectly legible, though very small, handwriting, Gibarian had drawn two lines: Supplement Ann. Solar. Vol 1.: Vote. Separation. Messenger ds aff. F.; Ravintzer: Little Apocrypha. That was all, not another word. Did these two lines contain important information? When had he written them? I told myself that I had to consult the files of the library as soon as possible. I was familiar with the supplement to the first volume of the Yearbook of Solarist Studies, that is to say, without having read it, I was aware of its existence – didn&#39;t it have the value of a purely historical document? As for Ravintzer and his Petit Apocryphe, I had never heard of them. What to do ? I was already almost a quarter of an hour late. Once again, with my back to the door, I searched the room attentively. Only then did I notice the bed, standing vertically against the wall and concealed by a large map of Solaris. Something was hanging behind the map – a pocket tape recorder. The reel had been recorded at nine tenths. I took the device out of its case, hung it up where I had found it, and slipped the tape recorder into my pocket. I returned to the door; eyes closed, I listened for outside noises. Nothing. I opened the door into a black chasm and finally had the sense to take off my glasses; the luminous filaments, under the ceiling, sparingly lighted the rotunda. Divided between the four doors of the living quarters and the passage leading to the radio cabin, a multitude of corridors spun off in a star shape in all directions. Suddenly, emerging from a recess that led to the common bathroom, a tall figure appeared, barely distinguishable, confused with the half-light. I stopped, riveted to the ground. A giant woman, of the Negroid type, was advancing quietly, waddling. I glimpsed the sparkle of the white of his eye and heard the soft tapping of his bare feet. She was dressed only in a yellow skirt, of plaited straw; her huge breasts swayed freely and her black arms were as big as thighs. She passed me – a distance of barely a meter separated us – without giving me the slightest glance. Her straw skirt swinging rhythmically, she continued on her way, like those Stone Age steatopygous statues you see in anthropology museums. She opened Gibarian&#39;s door. Her silhouette stood out clearly in the doorway, surrounded by the brighter light that had come on inside the room. Then she closed the door. I was alone. With my right hand, I grabbed my left hand, which I squeezed with all my strength, until the joints cracked. I stared blankly at the large, empty room. What had happened? What was that ? Suddenly I swayed; I remembered Snaut&#39;s warnings. What did that mean? Who was this monstrous Aphrodite? I took a step, a single step, in the direction of Gibarian&#39;s cabin. I knew very well that I would not enter. Nostrils wide apart, I sucked in the air. Why ? Oh yes ! Instinctively, I had waited for the characteristic smell of his sweat; but I hadn&#39;t felt anything, not even when we were only a step away from each other. I don&#39;t know how long I stood leaning against the cool metal wall, hearing nothing but the distant, monotonous sound of air conditioners. I lightly slapped both my cheeks and headed for the radio booth. When I pressed the handle, I heard a harsh voice. - Who&#39;s there ? “It&#39;s me, Kelvin. Snaut sat at a table set between a heap of aluminum boxes and the transmitter; he ate meat concentrate, which he drew directly from the tin can. Did he no longer leave the radio booth? Bewildered, I looked at him playing with his jaws; then I realized that I myself was starving. I approached the cupboards, chose the least dusty plate and sat down opposite Snaut. We ate in silence. Snaut stood up, uncorked an insulated bottle, and filled two goblets with hot broth. Putting the bottle back on the floor – there was no room on the table – he asked me: &#39;Have you seen Sartorius? &quot;No… where is he?&quot; - Up. Upstairs was the laboratory. We continued to eat, without saying anything more. Snaut dutifully scraped the bottom of his box. Four globes, fixed to the ceiling, lighted the room; an airtight shutter closed the window to the outside. The reflections of the luminous globes vibrated on the plastic cover of the transmitter. Snaut was now wearing a flowing black sweater, which frayed at the cuffs. Red veins marbled the taut skin of her cheekbones. He asked me: - What is it? - Nothing, why ? - You&#39;re all swimming. I wiped my forehead. It was true, I was streaming; the reaction, surely, after an unexpected encounter. Snaut looked at me quizzically. Should I tell him? If he had shown me more confidence… What incomprehensible game we were playing here, and who was the adversary of whom? - It&#39;s hot. I thought the air conditioning in your house worked better than that! — The devices adjust themselves automatically every hour. – His gaze became insistent: Are you sure it&#39;s just the heat? I did not answer. Snaut tossed the utensils and empty cans into the sink. He returned to his chair and continued to question me: - What are your intentions? I replied phlegmatically: - It depends on you. I assume you have a research plan, right? A new stimulus, probably X-rays, or something like that… He frowned. “X-rays… who told you about it? - I do not remember. Someone touched me a word about it. Maybe on the Prometheus. So, have you started? “I don&#39;t know the details. It was Gibarian&#39;s idea. He prepared this with Sartorius. I wonder how you can know. I shrugged: - You are not aware of the details? You should, since it&#39;s you… I didn&#39;t finish my sentence; Snaut was silent. The yapping of the air conditioners had ceased. The temperature remained at a bearable level. In the air lingered a nasal sound, like the buzzing of a dying fly. Snaut rose from his chair and leaned over the transmitter control panel; he began to maneuver the levers, without order and without result, for he had left the ignition switch in neutral. He amused himself thus for a moment; then he remarked: &#39;We&#39;ll have to complete the formalities concerning… I could only see his back; I say yes ? He turned around and glared at me. I hadn&#39;t specifically sought to infuriate him; but, ignoring the game that was being played, I forced myself to expectation full of reserve. Adam&#39;s apple jutted out from the neckline of his sweater. &#39;You went to Gibarian&#39;s,&#39; he said suddenly – and that wasn&#39;t a question. I looked at him peacefully. He repeated: &quot;You went to his house!&quot; I sketched a movement of the head: &quot;If you insist...&quot; He asked: - Was someone there? So he had seen her – at least he knew of her existence! &quot;Nobody… who could I have found there?&quot; &quot;Then why didn&#39;t you let me in?&quot; I smile: — Because I was afraid. I remembered your warnings. When the handle moved, I held it back mechanically. Why didn&#39;t you tell me it was you? I would have let you in. In an unsteady voice, he answered: &#39;I thought it was Sartorius. - So what ? To my question, he replied again with another question: - What do you think ... what happened there? I hesitated: - You must know better than me ... where is he? - In the cold room. We transported him right away this morning. &quot;Where did you find it?&quot; - In the closet. - In the closet ? Was he already dead? — The heart was still beating, but it was not breathing. It was the end. &quot;Have you tried to revive him?&quot; - No. - Why ? He stammered: &#39;I haven&#39;t had time. When I laid him down, he was dead. &quot;He was standing in the closet?&quot; In the middle of these combinations? - Yes. Snaut took a sheet of paper from the corner desk and handed it to me. “I wrote up a provisional report… After all, I&#39;m glad you saw the room. Cause of death, pernostal injection, lethal dose. It&#39;s written there… I scanned the sheet of paper with my eyes and murmured: — Suicide… what&#39;s the reason? - Nervous disorders, depression, call it what you want ... you know better than me. I remained seated; Snaut stood before me. Intercepting his gaze, I replied: - I only know what I saw myself. He asked quietly: &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &#39;He shot himself on the pernostal and hid in the cupboard, yes?&#39; In this case, it is not nervous disorders or an attack of depression, but a very serious condition, a paranoid psychosis… – Speaking more and more slowly and not taking her eyes off him, I added: He certainly had the impression of seeing something. Snaut resumed playing with the transmitter&#39;s joysticks. After a moment of silence, I resumed: “Here is your signature – and Sartorius&#39;s? “He&#39;s in the lab. I already told you. He doesn&#39;t show up. I suppose he…” “That he? — That he locked himself away. &quot;That he locked himself away?&quot; Ah, he&#39;s locked himself in… Maybe he&#39;s barricaded himself? - It&#39;s possible. “Snaut… there&#39;s someone in the Station, someone else. He had let go of the levers and was looking at me, his torso tilted to the side: — You saw! “You warned me. Against who ? Against what ? A hallucination? - What you saw ? - A human ? He was silent. He had turned against the wall, as if to hide his face from me. His fingertips tapped the metal plating. I examined his hands. There was no trace of blood on the joints. I had a brief glare. In a low voice, almost a breath, as if I had entrusted him with a secret that no one should hear, I said: - It is not a mirage, but a real being, that we can ... touch , that we can… hurt, and that you saw just today. - How do you know ? Glued facing the wall, he hadn&#39;t moved; my words hit him in the back. - Before my arrival ... very shortly before my arrival, is not it? He contracted; I saw his distraught gaze. - And you ! – He choked. - And you, who are you ? I thought he was going to rush at me. I had not expected such a reaction. The situation was becoming absurd. He didn&#39;t believe I was who I claimed to be! What did that mean? He looked at me with increasing terror. He was delirious? Had the mephitic emanations from the outside atmosphere intoxicated him? Everything was possible. Yes, and I… I had seen her, this creature… so, me too? I asked: &quot;Who is it?&quot; These words calmed him down. For a moment he looked at me with an inquisitive eye, as if he still doubted me. He sat down limply in his chair and put his head in his hands; even before he had opened his mouth, I had understood that he was not resolved to answer me directly. “Fever,” he said softly. I asked again: &quot;Who is it?&quot; He growled, &quot;If you don&#39;t know…&quot; &quot;Then what?&quot; - Nothing. — Snaut… We are isolated, far from everything. Let&#39;s put our cards on the table! Things are confusing enough. - What do you want ? “Tell me who you saw. - And you ? he asked suspiciously. - Well, I&#39;ll answer you and then you answer me. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy… — Crazy? Good Lord ! – He tried to smile. – But you didn&#39;t understand anything, absolutely nothing… If for a single moment he could have thought he was delirious, he wouldn&#39;t have done that, he would be alive. &#39;So your report, this story of nervous disorders, is it a lie?&#39; - Obviously ! &quot;Why not write the truth?&quot; He repeated: &quot;Why?&quot; A long silence followed. No, decidedly, I did not understand anything. I thought I had convinced him of my sincerity, I had imagined that we were going to combine our efforts to solve the enigma. Why, why did he refuse to speak? &quot;Where are the robots?&quot; - In warehouses. We locked them all away. We only left the reception staff in place. - Why ? Again he refused to answer. - You do not want to talk ? - I can not. Constantly he seemed on the point of giving up, then he slipped away. I might as well go up to Sartorius. I remembered the letter and, at that moment, I gave it capital importance: &quot;Do you plan to continue the experiments?&quot; He shook his shoulders disdainfully. - Ah ... so what are we going to do? He was silent. We heard, in the distance, a faint sound of footsteps, bare feet hitting the ground. Among the nickel-plated and plastic-coated instruments, among the high casings furrowed with glass tubes and containing the complicated equipment of the electronic installations, the muffled echo of this shuffling gait resounded in a grotesque and unreal way. Unable to control myself, I stood up; I listened to the footsteps approaching and watched Snaut. Eyelids half lowered, he didn&#39;t look frightened. Wasn&#39;t he afraid of her? I asked: &quot;Where does she come from?&quot; – And as he was slow to answer: You don’t want to tell me? - I do not know. - Good. The sound of footsteps receded and died. - You do not believe me ? he said. I swear I don&#39;t know. In silence, I opened the closet that contained the diving suits and I pushed aside the heavy tracksuits. At the bottom, as I had expected, hung the gas guns that we used to move in the void. I picked up a pistol, checked it was loaded, and slipped the scabbard strap over my shoulder. It wasn&#39;t a weapon per se, but it was better than nothing. As I was adjusting the length of the sling, Snaut smiled quizzically, baring his yellow teeth. &quot;Happy hunting!&quot; he said. I walked towards the door: - Thank you. He tore himself from his chair. “Kelvin! I looked at him. He was no longer smiling. I had never seen a face expressing so much weariness. He stammered, “Kelvin, it&#39;s not…I…really, I can&#39;t…” I waited; he moved his lips without uttering a sound. I turned around and got out.
