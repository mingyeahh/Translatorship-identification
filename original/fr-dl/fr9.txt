I was lying in the darkened room. Numb, I was staring - for how long? - the luminous dial of the watch attached to my wrist. I could hear my breathing and felt a vague sense of astonishment. In fact, I was profoundly indifferent to this ring of glowing numbers and even to my astonishment. I attributed it all to fatigue - numbness, astonishment and indifference. I turned on my side; the bed seemed strangely large. I held my breath; there was no sound in the silence. Harey! Why couldn't I hear him breathing? My arm went across the surface of the bed; I was alone. I was about to call to Harey, when I heard footsteps. A tall, heavy man was approaching... I asked quietly, "Gibarian? - I asked quietly, "Gibarian?" "Yes, it's me. Don't turn on the lamp! - Don't you? - It is not necessary. And it is better that we remain in the dark. - But are you dead? - Don't worry about that! You recognised my voice, didn't you? - Yes, I did. Why did you kill yourself? - I couldn't help it. You arrived four days late. If you had arrived earlier, I might not have had to kill myself. But don't torment yourself. I don't regret anything. - Are you really here, I'm not asleep? - Ah, you think you're dreaming about me, like you thought you were dreaming about Harey? - Where is it?

- Why should I know where she is? - I have a feeling you do. - Keep your feelings to yourself. Let's say I'm replacing her. - I wish she were here too! - She can't be. - Why not? You know that it's not really you who are here, that it's only me... - No. It's really me who is here. It's me again. But let's not waste our time with useless chitchat! - Will you go back? - Yes. - And, then, will she come back? - Do you want her to? What is she to you? - She belongs to me. - You are afraid of her. - No. - You are repulsed by her... - What do you want from me? - You have a right to feel sorry for yourself, not for her. She will always be twenty years old. You know that very well! Suddenly, for no specific reason, I calmed down. I listened to him calmly. It seemed to me that he had come closer and was now standing at the foot of the bed. I could not see him; the darkness was still impenetrable. I whispered, "What do you want? After a moment he answered: "Sartorius has convinced Snaut that you have fooled him. Now they are trying to fool you. Under the pretext of setting up an X-ray emitting device, they are building a magnetic field annihilator. - Where is it? - Can't you hear what I'm saying? I came to warn you! - Where is it? - I don't know where it is. Watch out! You'll need a weapon. You cannot count on anybody. - I can count on Harey. I heard a muffled noise; he was laughing.

- Of course you can rely on her, to a certain extent. And, in the end, you can resort to the same expedient as me. - You are not Gibarian. - Oh, really, and who am I? A dream character? - No, you're not. You're just a puppet. But you don't know that. - And how do you know who you are? I wanted to get up; I couldn't move. Gibarian was talking. I couldn't understand what he was saying; I could only hear the sound of his voice. I struggled desperately, trying to overcome the inertia of my body. A jolt and... I woke up. I sucked in the air greedily. It was night. I had been dreaming, it was a nightmare. And now I heard a distant, monotonous voice: "... a dilemma, which we are unable to resolve. We persecute ourselves. The polytheras only use a kind of selective amplifier of our thoughts. As soon as we try to find the motivation for these phenomena, we fall into anthropomorphism. Where there are no men, there can be no motives accessible to man. In order to continue the research, one must annihilate either one's own thoughts or their materialized form. It is not in our power to annihilate our thoughts. As for annihilating their materialized form, that would be like murder. I recognised Gibarian's voice at once. I felt the sheet beside me; I was alone in bed. I had fallen asleep again, I was dreaming again... I called out to him: "Gibarian? The voice stopped in the middle of a word. I heard a faint yelp and felt a draft on my face. I yawned, "Well, Gibarian, you're chasing me from dream to dream..." I heard a rustle nearby, and raised my voice, "Gibarian! The springs of the bed creaked. A voice whispered in my ear, "Kris, it's me.

- Is that you, Harey? And Gibarian? - Kris... Kris... but he... you told me he was dead! In a drawl, I answered: "He can live in a dream. - I wasn't absolutely certain that I was dreaming. - He spoke to me, he was here... I was terribly sleepy. If I'm sleepy, I thought, I might as well sleep. I brushed my lips over Harey's warm arm and settled back into the pillow. Harey said something more, but I was already asleep. In the red light of the morning I remembered the events of the night. I had dreamed that I was talking with Gibarian. But then... I had heard his voice, I could have sworn it. I couldn't remember exactly what he said. It was no longer a conversation; it sounded like a speech. A speech? Harey was washing himself. Harey was washing himself. The water was running in the bathroom. I looked under the bed, where a few days earlier I had hidden the tape recorder. It was gone. - Harey! - She pointed to her waterlogged face. - You didn't see a tape recorder under the bed, a small pocket tape recorder? - There were several things under the bed. I put everything on there! She pointed to a shelf next to the medicine cabinet and disappeared into the bathroom. I jumped down from the bed. My search was fruitless. When Harey left the bathroom, I said, "You must have noticed that tape recorder. She didn't answer; she was doing her hair in front of the mirror. Only then did I notice that she was pale and her eyes, when I met them in the mirror, expressed a suspicious curiosity. Stubbornly, I resumed: "Harey, the tape recorder is not on this shelf! - Don't you have anything more important to tell me? I mumbled: "I beg your pardon. You're right, I'm stupid to make such a fuss about a tape recorder.

No, don't argue! We went to breakfast. Harey didn't behave the same as on other days; but I couldn't tell the difference. She looked around; many times, lost in thought, she did not hear what I said. And once, when she raised her head, I saw that her eyes were wet. I whispered: "What's the matter, are you crying? She stammered: "Oh, leave me alone! These are not real tears. Perhaps I should not have been satisfied with this answer, but I was not afraid of anything so much as of "sincere conversations". I had dreamed that Snaut and Sartorius were plotting against me and, certain that I had only dreamed, I wondered if I would find any defensive weapons on the Station. I was only concerned about having a weapon, not about what I would do with it. I told Harey that I had to inspect the storerooms and shops. Silently, she followed me. I searched the crates, snooped in the capsules and, when I got to the bottom, I couldn't help but glance into the refrigeration plant. I did not want to let Harey in; I opened the door and looked around the room. The dark shroud covered an elongated form; from the door I could not see whether the black woman was still sleeping beside Gibarian's corpse. It seemed to me that she was no longer there. I could not find anything that suited me. I wandered from one shop to another and my mood became more and more gloomy. Suddenly I saw that Harey had disappeared. She came back at once - she had lingered in the corridor. When it was so painful for her to lose sight of me, even for a moment, she had tried to get away from me! This should have surprised me. Yet I continued to display an offended attitude - but who had offended me? - and to behave, in truth, like a moron.

I was suffering from a violent headache. In a rage, I emptied the contents of the medicine cabinet onto the floor - no trace of anti-seizure pills! I didn't want to go back to the operating theatre. I didn't feel like anything. I had never been in a worse mood. Harey glided like a shadow across the room; from time to time she would retreat somewhere - I don't know where, I didn't pay any attention to her - and then she would come back. In the afternoon, in the kitchen (we had just had lunch, but Harey had not actually eaten anything; I had not tried to encourage her to eat, because of my headache and lack of appetite), Harey left her seat and came and sat down beside me; she pinched the sleeve of my blouse. I grunted, "What's the matter? I had intended to go upstairs, for the pipes were crackling with echoes - Sartorius, it seemed, was fiddling with a high-voltage device. But I should have taken Harey with me. It was difficult enough to justify his presence in the library, and he might provoke some unfortunate remark from Snaut elsewhere, near the machines. I gave up trying to get out. - Kris," she murmured, "where are we now? I sighed in spite of myself; I was definitely not on a roll that day. - Everything's fine. Why is that? - I want to talk to you. - Well, I'm listening. - Not like this. - What way? I have a headache, you know that, I have a lot of worries... - Show some good will, Kris! I forced myself to smile; it was surely a miserable smile. - Speak, my darling, please. - Will you tell me the truth? I frowned; I didn't like that preamble. - Why should I lie?

- You may have your reasons, serious reasons. But if you want me to... listen, don't tell me lies! - I was keeping quiet. - I'll tell you something, and then you'll tell me something too. Well? But promise me you'll tell me the truth, straight out! - I avoided his gaze, which sought my eyes. - I already told you, I don't know how I got here. Maybe you do. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Maybe you don't know. But if you do know, and you can't tell me now, will you tell me one day, later? I wouldn't be any worse off, and you'd at least give me a chance. A cold blood ran through my veins; I stammered: - What are you talking about, my child... what chance? - Kris, whoever I am, I'm certainly not a child. You promised to answer. "Whoever I am!" My throat had closed up and I looked at Harey, shaking my head stupidly, as if I was fighting to hear more. - I'm not asking you to explain. It is enough that you tell me you are not allowed to speak. I answered in a hoarse voice: "I'm not hiding anything from you..." She stood up: "Very well. I wanted to say something. We couldn't leave it at that. But the words wouldn't come. - Harey... Standing in front of the window, she had her back to me. The blue-black ocean stretched under a bare sky. - Harey, if you think that... Harey, you know I love you... - Me? I came closer; I wanted to take her in my arms. She pulled away and pushed my hand away. - You are too good," she said. Do you love me? I'd rather you beat me! - Harey, my darling! - No, no, shut up! She returned to the table and gathered the plates. I looked out over the ocean. The sun was fading; the shadow of the Station

The sun was fading; the shadow of the Station was lengthening and rippling with the waves. Harey dropped a plate and it fell to the floor. Water ran into the sink. An arc of tarnished gold encircled the russet firmament. If only I knew what to do! Oh, if only I knew... Suddenly there was silence. Harey was standing behind me. - No, don't turn round," she said in a low voice. You're not guilty of anything, Kris. I know that. Don't torment yourself. I reached out to grab her. She ran to the back of the kitchen and lifted a pile of plates: - It's a pity they're unbreakable, I'd gladly break them, I'd break them all! For a moment I thought she was really going to throw the plates on the floor, but she looked at me and smiled: "Don't be afraid, I won't make a scene. My mind was alert and I woke up in the middle of the night and sat up in bed. The room was dark; through the half-open door, a faint light came from the rotunda. I heard a sinister hissing sound, accompanied by heavy, muffled knocks, as if some massive body was furiously striking a wall. A meteor had struck the Station's shell! No, not a meteor, a rocket, for I heard a horrible, dragging moan... I shook myself. There was no rocket any more than there was a meteor. Someone was moaning down the corridor! I ran in the direction from which the noise came. I saw a bright rectangle; the door of the small workshop was open. I rushed in. An icy vapour enveloped me. My breath fell like snow. White flakes swirled above a bathrobe, and under the dressing gown there was a body that rose weakly and hit the floor. The cloud of frost prevented me from seeing anything clearly. I threw myself on top of Harey, I grabbed her by the arm; the dressing gown was burning my skin. Harey continued to moan. I ran down the corridor, past several doors, I could no longer feel the cold. I could only feel the breath, which burned my neck like a flame.

I laid Harey on the operating table and pushed aside the dressing gown. Harey! A miserable face, shaking with tremors. The lips were covered with a thick, black layer of frozen blood; the tongue glistened with ice crystals. Liquid oxygen... The Deware bottles piled up in the workshop contained liquid oxygen. Shards of glass had crunched under my feet as I approached Harey. How much oxygen had she drunk? It didn't matter! The windpipe, the throat, the lungs, everything was burnt; liquid oxygen eats away at flesh more surely than concentrated acids. Breathing was weakening - a squeak, a dry sound of torn paper. Her eyes were closed. It was agony. I examined the large glass cabinets, filled with instruments and medicines. A tracheotomy? An intubation? She had no lungs! Medication? So much medicine! Rows of coloured bottles and boxes lined the shelves. She was still moaning; a trickle of mist escaped from between her open lips. The thermophores... I started to look for them, then changed my mind. I ran to another cupboard, shaking boxes of ampoules. And now a syringe - where are the syringes? Here's one that needs to be sterilised. I struggled in vain with the lid of the steriliser; my numb, insensitive fingers refused to fold back. The moaning grew louder. I leapt to Harey. She had opened her eyes. - Harey! It had not even been a whisper; I was speechless. My face was no longer mine, my lips did not obey me; I wore a plaster mask. I looked at Harey. The ribs trembled under the white skin; the snow had melted and the wet hair had spread over the headrest. And Harey was looking at me. - Harey! I couldn't say more. I stood there stiff as a log, my hands hanging down, unmoored from my body.

my body. I felt a burning sensation, rising from my feet, climbing, attacking my lips, my eyelids. A drop of blood melted and ran down his cheek, drawing a slanting line. The tongue twitched and disappeared. Harey continued to moan. I grabbed his wrist; there was no pulse. I put my ear under the left breast, against the cold body. I heard the din of a raging storm, and in the distance a gallop, the beating of the heart, so rapid that I could not count it. I remained bent over with my eyelids down, and something touched my head. Harey had run his fingers through my hair. I sat up. She moaned, "Kris! I took her hand; she responded with a bone-crushing pressure. Then she winced horribly and lost consciousness again. I could only see the whites of her eyes; a shrill roar ripped through her throat and convulsions shook her whole body. I struggled to hold her down on the operating table; she slipped away from me and her head hit the edge of a porcelain bowl. I caught her: I tried to control her, but every moment a violent spasm lifted her and she tore herself away from my embrace. I was dripping with sweat; my legs were wobbly. When the convulsions subsided, I tried to lay her down. She threw her chest forward and gasped for air. Suddenly the eyes, Harey's eyes, lit up that horrible bloody face. - Kris... since when... since when, Kris? She choked; a pink foam rose to her lips. The convulsions returned. With the last of my strength I clung to her shoulders. She fell on her back; her teeth chattered. She gasped. - No, no, no, she sighed hurriedly, and I thought the end was near. But the convulsions started again. And again I held her in my arms; from time to time she sucked in air with difficulty and all her ribs protruded. Then the lids half closed over the blind eyes. She stiffened. This

This time it was the end. I did not even try to wipe the foam from her lips. I heard a distant ringing. I waited for the last breath - then my strength would leave me completely and I would fall to the ground. She continued to breathe; the rattle was now only a faint hiss. The chest, which no longer quivered, began to move again with the rapid rhythm of the heartbeat. The cheeks became coloured. With my back arched, I contemplated her; I did not yet understand. My hands were clammy; a soft, supple material was blocking my ears, but I could hear the ringing still. Harey lifted his eyelids and our eyes met. I wanted to say his name, but no sound came through my lips. My face remained dead; I still wore that heavy mask. I could only look at her. She moved her head, looked around the room. Somewhere behind me, in another world, water was dripping from a poorly closed tap. Harey leaned on an elbow; she sat down. I stepped back. She was watching me. - What," she said, "what's the matter? Didn't it work? Why are you looking at me like that? - And suddenly a terrible scream: Why are you looking at me like that? Silence. She looked at her hands, wiggled her fingers. - Is that me?" she asked. With my lips, in a breath, I said: - Harey... She repeated: - Harey? Slowly, she let herself slide over the edge of the operating table. She staggered, regained her balance and took a few steps. She was in a stupor; she looked at me, but did not seem to see me. - Harey?" she repeated again. But I am not Harey. Who am I? Harey? And you? Her eyes widened, shone and a surprised smile lit up her face: - And you, Kris? Maybe you are too...

I was silent; I had backed up to the wall; I was leaning against a cupboard door. The smile faded. - No," she said. No, you are afraid. But I can't stand this. I can't stand it. I didn't know what to do. Even now, I don't understand anything. No, it's impossible! She clenched her white knuckles and beat her chest. - I didn't know anything, except that I was Harey! Do you think I'm acting? I'm not acting, I swear, I'm not acting! She moaned the last words and collapsed to the floor sobbing. Something in me gave way. I leapt to her side and wrapped my arms around her. She struggled, pushed me away, sobbing without tears, and shouted: - Leave me, leave me! I disgust you, I know it! I don't want to, I don't want to! You can see that it's not me, not me, not me... I shook her and shouted: - Shut up! Kneeling in front of each other, we both screamed. Harey's head came down on my shoulder. I clutched it with all my strength. We were both gasping for breath and not moving. The water dripped from the tap. Kris... tell me what I have to do to disappear! Kris... I shouted: - Shut up! She raised her head and looked at me: "What, you don't know either? Can't we do anything? - Harey, please! - I tried... No, no, leave me alone, I don't want you to touch me! I disgust you. - That's not true. - You're lying... I disgust you... and I also disgust myself... oh, if I could, if I could only. - Would you kill yourself?

- Yes. - And I don't want to! Do you understand? I don't want you to die. I want you to be here with me, I want nothing else! The big grey eyes stared at me. - You're lying," she said quietly. I let go of her and stood up; she just sat there. - Tell me what I have to do to make you believe me! I swear to you that I am not lying. Only you exist, only you matter to me. - It is impossible for you to tell the truth, because I am not Harey. - So who are you? She was silent for a long moment. Several times, her chin trembled. At last she bowed her head and whispered, 'Harey, but I know it's not true. I am not the one you once loved. - Indeed, but the past is gone, the past is dead. Here, today, it is you that I love. Do you understand? She shook her head: - You are good. Don't think I don't appreciate everything you've done. You did everything you could. But there's nothing to do. The first morning, when I was waiting beside your bed for you to wake up, I didn't know anything. Only three days have passed, but it seems like a long, long time ago. I was acting like a crazy person. My head was full of fog. I couldn't remember anything, I wasn't surprised by anything - I felt like I did after a narcosis, or after a long illness. I even thought that maybe I had been ill, and that you didn't want to tell me. Then certain events gave me pause for thought. You know what I mean. Then you had that conversation in the library with that man - what was his name? - Snaut, yes. You refused to explain anything to me, so I got up at night and listened to the tape. I only lied that one time, Kris - when you were looking for the tape recorder, I knew where it was, I had hidden it. The man who recorded that tape - what's his name?

- Gibarian. - Yes, Gibarian. Listening to him, I understood everything. Although in truth I still don't understand anything. I just didn't know that I can't... that I'm not... that there's no end. He didn't say anything about that. Maybe he did, but you woke up, and I turned off the tape recorder. I had heard enough to learn that I am not a human being, but an instrument. - What are you saying? - Yes. To study your reactions, or something like that. Each of you has a... an instrument like me. We come out of your memories, or your imagination, I don't know. Besides, you know all this better than I do. If it didn't fit in with the rest, I certainly wouldn't have believed it! - The rest? - Oh, the fact that I don't need to sleep, and that I have to follow you everywhere. Only yesterday I thought you hated me and that made me unhappy. What an idiot! But how could I have imagined the truth? He, Gibarian, didn't hate this woman who was with him at all, but he talks about her in such a... such a terrible way! Only then did I understand that nothing depended on me, that I could do this or that, it didn't matter, it would always be torture for you. Worse than torture, because the instruments of torture are passive and innocent, as innocent as the stone that falls and kills you. That an instrument of torture should love you and wish you well was beyond my comprehension. I would have liked to tell you all this, to communicate the little I had understood. I thought it might be useful to you. I even tried to take notes... I cleared my throat and asked painfully: - Is that why you lit a lamp? - Yes. But I couldn't write anything down. I was looking for this... you know, this 'influence' inside me... I was panicking. It seemed to me that I didn't have a body under my skin, that inside me there was something


something... different, that I was just an appearance, meant to deceive you. Do you understand? - I understand. - When you don't sleep at night, and you think for hours, you go very far with your thoughts, you know, and you go down strange paths... - Yes, I know. - But I could feel my heart beating. And I remembered that you had analysed my blood. How is it, my blood, tell me, tell me the truth! Now you can tell me the truth. - Your blood is the same as mine. - Is it? - I swear to you. - What does that mean? I thought that maybe this... this unknown thing was hiding somewhere inside me, that maybe it took up very little space. But I didn't know where it was hiding. Now I think I was trying to find a subterfuge, because I didn't dare to decide; I was afraid, I was looking for another way out. But Kris, if I have the same blood as you... if I really... No, it's impossible. I would be dead already, wouldn't I? That means there is a difference. Where is the difference? In the head? I suppose I think like any human being... and I don't know anything! If this unknown thing was thinking in my head, I'd know everything. And I wouldn't like you. I would be acting, knowing that I was acting... Kris, please tell me everything you know. Maybe we can find a solution. - What solution? - She was silent. - Do you want to die? - Yes, I think so. Again there was silence. Harey sat there, withdrawn. I looked around the room, at the white enamel furniture, at the gleaming instruments; my eyes tried desperately to catch some hitherto unsuspected beacon that had suddenly revealed itself. - Harey, can I say something too? - She waited silently. - It's true, you're not exactly the same as me. But this is not a pejorative statement. At


On the contrary. Whatever your opinion on the subject, it is thanks to this... difference that you are not dead. She smiled a small, painful smile, the smile of a sad child: - Does that mean that I am... immortal? - I don't know. In any case, you are much less vulnerable than I am. She murmured: "That's awful..." "Maybe not as awful as you think. - But you don't envy me. - Harey, I don't know what your... fate is. The truth is, your fate is as unpredictable as mine, as unpredictable as the fate of any of the Station's inhabitants. The experiment will continue, and anything can happen... - Or nothing. - Or nothing. And I confess that I prefer that nothing happens. Not because I'm afraid (although fear undoubtedly plays a part in this), but because there will be no outcome. Of that I am absolutely certain. - What outcome? You mean this... ocean? She shivered. - Yes, contact with the ocean. I think the problem is actually very simple. Contact means the exchange of certain knowledge, certain notions, or at least certain results, certain states of affairs - but what if there is no exchange possible? If the elephant is not a giant microbe, the ocean is not a giant brain. On both sides, of course, attempts can be made. And the consequence of one of these attempts is that you are here, now, with me. And I am trying to explain to you that I love you. Your presence alone erases the twelve years of my life that I have devoted to the study of Solaris, and I wish to keep you with me. Have you been sent to torture me, or to make my life sweeter, or are you just an instrument that does not know its function and is used to examine me as if through a microscope? Are they using you to show me friendship, to strike me an insidious blow, or to mock me? Perhaps all of these at once,

or perhaps - and this is the most likely - it is something else. But why should we care about the intentions of our parents - even if our procreators are nothing alike? You will answer that our future depends on these intentions, and I will not contradict you. I can't predict the future any more than you can. I cannot even assure you that I will always love you. Given what has happened, anything is to be expected. Perhaps tomorrow I will be turned into a green jellyfish? Nothing depends on us. But since it depends on us to make a decision today, let's decide to stay together! What do you say? - Listen, I would like to ask you again... Do I... look a lot like him? - You used to look a lot like him. Now I don't know. - I don't understand... She stood up and looked at me with her huge eyes. - There's only you left. - And you're sure it's not her, that it's only me, me that... - Yes, you. If you were really her, I might not be able to love you... - Why? - Because I've done something horrible. - You were... mean to her? - Yes, when we... - Don't say anything! - Why not? - So that you don't forget. - So that you don't forget that it's me who's here, and not her.
