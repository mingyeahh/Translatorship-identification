The next day, returning from lunch, I found a note from Snaut on the table by the window. He reported that Sartorius had paused work on the annihilator for the time being, in order to irradiate the ocean with a burst of hard rays as a last attempt. &quot;Honey,&quot; I said, &quot;I have to go to Snaut&#39;s.&quot; The red sunrise glowed in the windows and divided the room in two. We were in a blue shade. Outside its border, everything seemed copper, you&#39;d think any book would jingle when it fell off the shelf. - This is the experiment. I just don&#39;t know how to do it. I&#39;d rather, you understand...&#39; I stopped. - Don&#39;t explain yourself, Kris. I would like that... If it didn&#39;t last long? &quot;It&#39;s going to take a while,&quot; I said. &quot;Listen, what if you came with me and waited in the hall?&quot; - Okay. But what if I can&#39;t stand it? - What is it like? I asked, and added quickly, &quot;I&#39;m not asking out of curiosity, you understand, but perhaps, once you figured it out, you&#39;d be able to control it yourself.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s fear,&quot; she said. She turned a little pale. &quot;I can&#39;t even tell what I&#39;m afraid of because I&#39;m not really afraid, I&#39;m just losing myself.&quot; At the last moment I still feel such, such shame, I can&#39;t tell you. And then nothing. That&#39;s why I thought it was some kind of disease ... - she finished more quietly and shuddered. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s only here in this cursed Station,&quot; I said. &quot;As for me, I&#39;ll do everything to get us out of her as soon as possible.&quot; - Do you think it&#39;s possible? she opened her eyes. - Why not? After all, I&#39;m not chained here... anyway, that will also depend on what I agree with Snaut. How long do you think you can be alone? &quot;It depends...&quot; she said slowly. She lowered her head. &quot;If I can hear your voice, I think I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; - I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t hear what we&#39;re saying. Not that I have anything to hide from you, but I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t know what Snaut will say. - Do not end. I see. Okay. I will stand so that I can only hear the sound of your voice. It is enough for me. - I&#39;ll call him from the studio now. I&#39;ll leave the door open. She nodded. I stepped out through a wall of red sunlight into a corridor that was almost black by contrast despite the artificial lighting. The door of the small studio stood open. The mirrored remains of a Dewar flask lying on the floor beneath a row of great reservoirs of liquid oxygen were the last trace of the night&#39;s events. The small screen lit up as I took off the phone and dialed the radio number. The bluish film of light that seemed to coat frosted glass on the inside cracked, and Snaut, leaning sideways over the arm of a high chair, looked me straight in the eye. &quot;Hello,&quot; he said. - I read the card. I&#39;d like to talk to you. Can I come? - You can. In a second? - Yes. - Please. Or... in company? - No. His skinny face, brown from sunburn, with thick transverse wrinkles on his forehead, tilted slanted in convex glass, as if he were a strange fish living in an aquarium, from which he peeped through the glass, took on an ambiguous expression. &quot;Well, well,&quot; he said. - So, I&#39;m waiting. &quot;We can go, honey,&quot; I began with not quite natural animation, entering the cabin through red streaks of light beyond which I could only see Harey&#39;s looming silhouette. The voice failed me; she sat slumped in an armchair, her elbows folded under the armrests. Did she hear my footsteps too late, or couldn&#39;t she release that terrible spasm quickly enough to assume a normal pose, but I saw her for a second struggling with that incomprehensible force that was within her, and my heart was choked by a blind, mad anger mixed with pity. We walked silently along a long corridor, passing its sections covered with multi-colored enamel, which was - in the intention of the architects - to diversify the stay in the armored shell. From a distance, I saw the open door of the radio station. A long streak of red fell from them down the corridor, because the sun was shining here too. I looked at Harey, who didn&#39;t even try to smile, saw her all the way, focused, preparing to fight with herself. The impending exertion had already changed her face, which had gone pale and seemed to shrink. A dozen paces from the door she stopped, I turned to her, she pushed me lightly with her fingertips to go, and suddenly my plans, Snaut, the experiment, the whole Station, everything seemed to me as nothing compared to the ordeal she had come here to face. I felt like a tormentor and was about to turn back, when a wide streak of sunlight, broken on the wall of the corridor, was obscured by a human shadow. Quickening my pace, I entered the cabin. Snaut was on the doorstep, as if he was heading to meet me. The red sun was in a straight line behind him, and a purple glow seemed to radiate from his gray hair. We stared at each other for a while, saying nothing. He seemed to be examining my face. I couldn&#39;t see his expression, blinded by the glare of the window. I walked around him and stood next to a high desk from which the flexible stems of microphones protruded. He turned slowly on the spot, following me calmly with that slight curve of his lips, which, in fact, hardly changed, became now a smile, sometimes a grimace of fatigue. Without taking his eyes off me, he walked over to the all-wall metal cabinet, which was heaped on either side with hastily discarded piles of spare radio parts, thermal batteries, and tools, pulled a chair over there, and sat down, leaning his back against the enamel door. The silence we had kept until now was becoming strange to say the least. I listened to them, focusing on the silence that filled the corridor where Harey stayed, but there was not the slightest murmur. - When will you be ready? I asked. - We could even start today, but the record will take some time, - The record? You mean encephalogram? - Well, you agreed. What? he paused. - No, nothing. &quot;I hear you,&quot; Snaut said as silence began to build between us again. &quot;She already knows... about herself,&quot; I lowered my voice almost to a whisper. He raised his eyebrows. - Yes? I got the impression he wasn&#39;t really surprised. So why was he pretending? At one point I didn&#39;t feel like talking, but I prevailed. Let it be loyalty, I thought, if nothing else. She must have guessed from our conversation in the library, watched me, added one thing to another, then found Gibarian&#39;s tape recorder and listened to the tape... He didn&#39;t change his position, still leaning against the wardrobe, but there was a small twinkle in his eyes. Standing at the lectern, I had the wing of the door open in front of me, opening onto the corridor. I lowered my voice even more. “She tried to kill herself last night while I was sleeping. Liquid oxygen... Something rustled like a draft through loose papers. I froze, listening to what was in the corridor, but the source of the murmur was closer. It rattled like a mouse... Mouse! Nonsense. There were no mice here. I watched from under the seat&#39;s eye. &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;Of course she failed... at least she knows who she is.&quot; - Why are you telling me this? he asked suddenly. I didn&#39;t know what to say at first. &quot;I want you to know... so you know what it&#39;s like,&quot; I muttered. - I warned you. &quot;You mean you knew,&quot; I raised my voice involuntarily. - No. Of course not. But I explained to you how it is. Each &quot;visitor&quot; is almost a phantom when he arrives, apart from a jumble of memories and images drawn from his... Adam... he is actually empty. The longer he is here with you, the more human he becomes. to certain limits, of course. So the longer it goes on, the harder it gets... He broke off, looked at me scowling and said casually, &quot;She knows everything?&quot; &quot;Yes, I told you already.&quot; &quot;Everything? that she&#39;s been here once before and that you... &quot;No!&quot; He smiled. &quot;Kelvin, listen, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do, exactly? Leave the Station?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;With her?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; He was silent, as if thought over his answer, but there was something else in his silence... what? Again that imperceptible breeze rustled just behind a thin wall. He shifted in his chair. &quot;Excellent,&quot; he said. &quot;Do as you wish, my dear. It would look nice if, on top of everything, we started using mousse! I&#39;m not going to convince you, I&#39;ll just tell you this: you are trying - in an inhumane situation - to act like a human. It may be beautiful, but it&#39;s useless. Anyway, I&#39;m not sure about this beauty either, because can something stupid be beautiful? But that&#39;s not the point. You resign from further experience, you want to leave, taking her. Yes? - Yes. - But it&#39;s also... an experience. do you think? - How do you understand that? Will she... be able to...? If you&#39;re with me, I can&#39;t see... I spoke slower and slower until I stopped. Snaut sighed slightly. “We&#39;re all ostrich politics here, Kelvin, but at least we know it and we&#39;re not pretending to be nobility. - I&#39;m not posing for anything. Okay, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. I take back what I said about nobility, but the ostrich policy remains in place. You are cultivating it in a particularly dangerous form. You&#39;re lying to yourself and to her and to yourself again. Do you know the conditions for stabilizing a system made of neutrino matter? - No. And you don&#39;t know. Nobody knows this. - Of course. But one thing we do know is that such a system is unstable and can only exist thanks to a constant supply of energy. I know this from Sartorius. This energy creates a twisted stabilizing field. Now, is this field external to the &quot;visitor&quot;? Or is the source of this field within his body? Do you understand the difference?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said slowly. &quot;If it&#39;s external, then... she, then... ... &quot;The system will break up as it moves away from Solaris,&quot; he finished for me, &quot;we can&#39;t predict it, but you&#39;ve already done the experiment. That rocket you launched... it&#39;s still circling, you know. I even calculated the elements in my spare time. You can fly, go into orbit, get close and find out what happened to the... passenger... &quot;You&#39;re crazy!&quot; I hissed, &quot;You think so? Well... what if... &quot;No. It can be done. It&#39;s remote-controlled. We&#39;ll bring it out of orbit and...&quot; &quot;Stop it!&quot; &quot;Also, no? So there&#39;s one way, very simple. It doesn&#39;t even have to land on the Station. Yes, let it go on. only on the radio, if she&#39;s alive, she&#39;ll call back and... &quot;But, but the oxygen has long since run out!&quot; I choked out... &quot;Maybe he cares without oxygen. Well, shall we try? &quot;Snaut... Snaut..., &quot;Kclvin... Kelvin...&quot; he mimicked me angrily. - Think about what kind of man are you? Who do you want to make happy? Save? Myself? I? Which? This or that? Are you not brave enough for both? You see where this leads! I&#39;m telling you for the last time: this, here, is an immoral situation. Suddenly I heard the same scratching sound as before, like nails scratching the wall. I don&#39;t know why a kind of passive, muddy calm came over me. It was as if I was watching the whole situation, the two of us, from a great distance through inverted binoculars: minor, a bit funny, not important. &quot;Okay then,&quot; I said. - And what do you think I should do? remove it? It&#39;ll be the same tomorrow, won&#39;t it? And once more? And so every day? How long? For what? What&#39;s in it for me? And you? Sartorius? station? - No, you answer me first. You will start with it and, let&#39;s say, witness the following transformation. In a few minutes you&#39;ll see in front of you... - Well, what? I said with a sneer. - A monster? Demon, eh? - No. Plain, plain agony. Have you really believed in their immortality? I assure you they are dying... What will you do then? Will you be back for... reserve? - Stop!!! I screamed clenching my fist. He stared at me with an indulgent sneer in narrowed eyes. - Oh, should I stop? You know, if I were you, I&#39;d drop this conversation. You&#39;d better do something else, you can, for example, slash with rods - for revenge - the ocean. What do you mean! So, if - he made a playful farewell gesture with his hand while raising his eyes to the ceiling as if he was following a receding figure - will you be a scoundrel? So, isn&#39;t it? Smile when you want to howl, pretend to be happy and calm when you want to bite your fingers, then you&#39;re not a scoundrel? What if you can&#39;t not be here? Then what? You&#39;re going to be mad at Snaut, who&#39;s to blame for everything, right? Well, on top of that, you&#39;re an idiot, my dear... &quot;You&#39;re talking about yourself,&quot; I said with my head bowed. - I love her. - Who? Your memory. - No. I. I told you what she wanted to do. That&#39;s not what a lot of... real people would do. - You admit it yourself when you say... - Don&#39;t take my word for it. - Okay. So she loves you. And you want to love her. It is not the same. - You&#39;re wrong. - Kelvin, I&#39;m sorry, but you got into your intimate affairs yourself. You do not love. you love. She&#39;s ready to give her life. You too. Very Touching, very beautiful, noble, anything you want. But there&#39;s no room for all of that here. There isn&#39;t. Understand? No, you don&#39;t want to understand that. You are entangled by forces beyond our control in a circular process of which she is a part. Phase. A repeating rhythm. If it were... if you were haunted by a do-it-all monstrosity, you wouldn&#39;t hesitate a moment to remove it. Truth? - Truth. &quot;So, maybe that&#39;s why she&#39;s not such a monster!&quot; Does it tie your hands? That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about to keep you tied! &quot;Just one more hypothesis to the millions in the library.&quot; Snaut, come on, she&#39;s... no. I don&#39;t want to talk about it with you. - Okay. You started it yourself. But just think, she&#39;s basically a mirror reflecting part of your brain. If it&#39;s great, it&#39;s because your memory was great. You gave the recipe. Circular process, don&#39;t forget! - So what do you want from me? That I... that I remove it? I already asked you: why should I do this? You did not answer. - I will answer you now. I didn&#39;t invite you to this interview. I didn&#39;t touch your affairs. I don&#39;t command you or forbid you, and I wouldn&#39;t even if I could. It&#39;s you, you came here and laid it all out for me, and you know what for? No? In order to take it off. knock it down. I know the burden, my dear! Yes, yes, don&#39;t interrupt me! I&#39;m not interrupting you, but you, you want me to interrupt you. If I stood in your way, maybe you&#39;d smash my head in, then you&#39;d be dealing with me, someone made of the same blood and clay as you, and you&#39;d feel like a man yourself. And yes... you can&#39;t handle it, and that&#39;s why you&#39;re arguing with me... and, in fact, with yourself! Just tell me you&#39;d be bent over in agony if she suddenly disappeared, no, don&#39;t say anything. - Well, you know! I came to tell you out of simple loyalty that I intend to leave the Station with her.&quot; I fended off his attack, but found it unconvincing myself. Snow shrugged. - It&#39;s very possible that you need to stick to yours. If I&#39;ve spoken on this at all, it&#39;s only because you&#39;re going higher and higher, and falling from a height, you understand... Come up tomorrow morning around nine o&#39;clock to Sartorius&#39;s... Will you come? &quot;To Sartorius?&quot; I asked in surprise. - He doesn&#39;t let anyone in, you said you can&#39;t even make a phone call. &quot;He&#39;s done fine now. We don&#39;t talk about it, you know. You are... it&#39;s quite different. Well, smaller. will you come in the morning? &quot;I&#39;ll come,&quot; I murmured. I was looking at Snaut. His left hand casually hid behind the wardrobe door. When did they turn away? It must have been quite a long time ago, but in the excitement of this terrible conversation for me, I didn&#39;t pay attention to it. How unnatural it looked... Like... he was hiding something there. Or if someone was holding his hand. I licked my lips. &quot;Snaut, what are you?&quot; &quot;Go out,&quot; he said softly, very calmly. - Get out. I left and closed the door behind me in the last red glow. Harey was sitting on the floor about ten paces away, against the wall. She jumped up at the sight of me. - You see...? She said looking at me with shining eyes. - It worked, Kris... Yes, it did. I&#39;m happy. Maybe... maybe it will get better... &quot;Oh, sure,&quot; I replied absently. We walked back to each other and I was racking my brains over this idiotic wardrobe. So, so he was hiding there...? And all this conversation...? My cheeks started to burn so much that I rubbed them involuntarily. God, what madness. And what actually happened? on nothing? That&#39;s right, tomorrow morning... And suddenly I was afraid, almost like last night. My encephalogram. The total record of all brain processes, translated into ray burst fluctuations, will be sent down. Into the depths of this boundless, boundless monster. As he said, &quot;if she were to disappear, you&#39;d be in terrible pain, wouldn&#39;t you...?&quot; An encephalogram is a complete record. Including unconscious processes. If I want her to disappear, to die? Otherwise, would I be so terrified that she survived this terrible attack? responsible for my own subconscious? If I&#39;m not responsible for it, who would...? What an idiot! Why on earth did I agree that mine, my... I can study it beforehand, of course, this record, but it I can&#39;t read it. No one can. Specialists can only determine what the subject was thinking about, but the same generalities: that, for example, he was solving a mathematical problem, but they can&#39;t tell what, they say it&#39;s impossible, because the encephalogram is a resultant, a mixture of a multitude of simultaneously running processes, and only some of them have a psychic &quot;lining&quot;... And the subconscious ones... They don&#39;t want to talk about those at all, and where is it for them to read someone&#39;s memories, repressed or not suppressed... But why so b oh? After all, I told Harey this morning that this experiment wouldn&#39;t work. Well, because if our neurophysiologists can&#39;t read the record, then why would this most alien, black, liquid giant ... But it entered me, I don&#39;t know how, to traverse all my memory and find its most painful atom. How to doubt it. And without any help, without any kind of &quot;radiant transmission&quot;, it penetrated through the double-encapsulated armor, through the heavy shells of the Station, found my body inside and left with the loot... &quot;Kris...?&quot; Harey said softly. at the window, staring with unseeing eyes at the beginning of the night, a delicate endosperm, faint at this latitude, obscured the stars, a uniform but thin layer of clouds so high that the sun from the depths, below the horizon, gave them the faintest, pink-silver glow. that will mean I wanted it That I killed her Not to go there They can&#39;t make me But what will I tell them? that there may be thoughts, intentions, hopes, cruel, wonderful, murderous thoughts in me, and I know nothing about them.Man set out to meet other worlds, other civilizations, not fully knowing his own nooks, dead ends, wells, barricaded dark door. Give her to them... out of shame? Spend it just because I lack the courage? &quot;Kris...&quot; Harey whispered even more quietly than before. I felt rather than heard her silently approach me and pretended I didn&#39;t know. I wanted to be alone right now. I had to be alone. I haven&#39;t made a decision yet, no resolution has been made. Staring up at the darkening sky, at the stars that were only the spectral shadow of earth&#39;s stars, I stood motionless, and in the emptiness that replaced the racing thoughts of a moment ago, there grew a wordless dead, indifferent certainty that where I could not reach, I had already chosen and pretended that nothing had happened, I didn&#39;t even have the strength to despise myself.
