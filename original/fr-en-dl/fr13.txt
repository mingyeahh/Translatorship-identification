Three weeks passed. The window shutters were lowered and raised at fixed times. At night I was a prisoner of my nightmares. And every morning the comedy began again. But was it a comedy? I was making up a peaceful appearance, and Harey was playing the same game; we were deceiving each other, knowingly, and this agreement served our ultimate escape: we were talking about the future, about our life on Earth, about settling in the vicinity of a big city. We would never leave Earth again, we would spend the rest of our lives under the blue sky and among the green trees. Together we imagined the layout of our house, the layout of the garden; we argued over details, the location of a hedge or a bench... Was I sincere for a moment? No. I knew that our plans were impossible. I knew that. For even if Harey had been able to leave the Station and survive the journey, how could I have got through the control barriers with my stowaway? Earth is only for humans, and every human being must have proper papers. At the first checkpoint, Harey would be detained, trying to establish his identity; we would be separated and Harey would immediately betray himself. The Station was the only place we could live together. Did Harey know this? She must have. Had someone told her? One night I heard Harey getting up slowly. I wanted to hold her back - in the darkness and silence we could still free ourselves for a moment from despair, escape torture by forgetting. Harey had not noticed that I had woken up. When I reached out, she was already standing. Barefoot, she was walking towards the door.

I felt a confused anguish, and without daring to raise my voice, I whispered, "Harey..." I sat down on the bed. I sat down on the bed. Harey had gone out, leaving the door ajar: a thin wall of light cut obliquely across the room. I seemed to hear whispers. Harey was talking with someone... with whom? I jumped out of bed, but a mad terror seized me, and my legs refused to move. I listened, but there was no sound. I let myself fall back on the sheet. Blood pounded in my temples. I began to count. I had reached a thousand when the door panel swung open. Harey entered, closed the door silently and stood still for a moment. I tried to breathe regularly. She called softly, "Kris! I didn't answer. She quickly crawled into bed and lay down beside me, careful not to touch me. I did not move; in my head I formed questions, but I refused to speak first. How long did I stay like that, asking silent questions? Perhaps an hour. Then I fell asleep. The morning was like so many other mornings; I watched Harey on the sly; I saw no change in his behaviour. After breakfast we sat facing the large picture window; the Station was sailing through the purple clouds. Harey was reading a book, and as I stared ahead I suddenly realised that if I tilted my head at a certain angle I could see our double reflection in the glass. I took my hand off the bar. Harey had no idea that I was looking at her through the glass: she glanced at me and, from my attitude, obviously judged that I was looking at the ocean. Then she leaned forward to the bar and kissed the spot my hand had just touched. The next moment she was reading her book again. - Harey," I asked softly, "where did you go last night? - Last night?

- Yes, you... you dreamt it, Kris, I didn't go anywhere. - You didn't go out? - No... you must have been dreaming. - Maybe... yes, maybe I dreamt... In the evening I started talking again about our journey, about returning to Earth. Harey interrupted me: "Don't talk to me about this trip anymore, Kris! I don't want to hear any more about it, you know... - What? - No, nothing. When we were in bed, she told me she was thirsty: "There's a glass of syrup on the table, would you give it to me, please? She drank half the glass, then handed it to me. I wasn't thirsty. She smiled: "Drink to my health! I drank the syrup, which seemed a little salty, but my mind was elsewhere: - Harey... - She had just turned off the lamp. - Harey, since you don't want to talk about our trip, let's talk about something else! - If I didn't exist, would you get married? - No. Never? - Never. - Why not? - I don't know why. I was alone for ten years, and I never got married again. Let's not talk about that, my dear... My head was spinning, as if I had drunk too much wine. - No, let's talk about it! What if I begged you to do it? - To marry me? What an absurd idea, Harey! I don't need anyone but you. She leaned over me; her breath brushed my lips; she hugged me with all her strength: "Say it differently!

- I love you. Her head fell on my arm; I felt tears. - Harey, what's wrong with you? - Nothing... nothing... nothing..." she repeated, lower and lower. My eyes were closing. The red dawn woke me up. My head was heavy and my neck stiff, as if the vertebrae had fused together. My tongue was pasty and I swallowed a bitter saliva. What had I poisoned myself with? I reached for Harey; my hand felt for a cold sheet. I jumped to my feet. I was alone - alone in the bed, alone in the cabin. The curved window reflected a row of red suns. I jumped to the floor. Staggering like a drunken man, clinging to the furniture, I reached the sliding wardrobe; the bathroom was empty. The rotunda was empty. There was no one in the workshop. - Harey! Waving my arms, I ran in all directions and called for him. One last time I shouted: "Harey! And my voice choked: I already knew the truth... I don't remember exactly what happened next. Half naked, I ran from one end of the Station to the other. I think I remember that I even entered the refrigeration plant, that I explored the warehouse shops. I was banging my fists against the locked doors. I would walk away and then come back and hit the doors that had already resisted me. I tumbled down the stairs, fell, got up, rushed I don't know where, forward... A glass wall slid open: I had reached the double armoured door that opened onto the ocean. I attacked the door; I shouted; I still hoped I was dreaming. For a moment, someone had been beside me; someone was grabbing me, dragging me... I found myself lying on a metal table in the small workshop. I was panting. Alcohol vapour burned my nostrils and my throat. My shirt was soaked with ice water, my hair stuck to my head.

Snaut was busy in front of a medicine cabinet, stirring glass instruments and utensils, which clashed with an unbearable noise. Suddenly I saw him standing over me, staring into my eyes. - Where is she? - She is not here. - He stooped and drew his face close and said slowly, very distinctly, 'Harey is dead. I closed my eyes and whispered, "She will come back. I didn't dread her return; I wished she would. I couldn't explain to myself why I had once tried to chase her away, why I had been so afraid of her return! He handed me a glass: "Here, drink this! I threw the entire contents of the glass in his face. He stepped back and wiped his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, I was standing over him with all my height; he was so small... - It's you! - What are you talking about? - No stories, you know what I mean! It was you she met the other night... And you told her to give me a sleeping pill... What happened to her? I'm listening! He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out an envelope. I snatched it out of his hand; it was stuck and had no writing on it. I tore the envelope open; it contained a sheet of paper folded in four. I recognised the handwriting, a large, irregular, slightly childish handwriting: "My darling, I asked him. He is good. I'm sorry I had to lie to you. Please do me this one favour, listen to him, and above all don't hurt yourself. You were wonderful.

There was one last word, crossed out, but I could make it out: she had signed "Harey". I read and re-read the letter. I was fully lucid again; I wasn't going to scream hysterically. I had no voice, not even the strength to moan. Finally I whispered, "How? - Later, Kelvin. Calm down! - I am calm. Speak! What? - By annihilation. - But... what about the device? - The Roche device wasn't suitable. Sartorius built another one, a new destabilizer. A miniature device with a range of a few metres. - And she... - She disappeared. A flash of light and a breath of air. A small puff of air. That's all. - Yes, we didn't have the materials to build a large device. The walls were leaning towards me, I closed my eyes. - But... she... she will come back. - No. - What do you know? - No, Kelvin, she won't. Remember those foamy wings, going up? They haven't come back since that day. - Haven't they? - No, they haven't. I said softly: - You killed her... - Yes... if you were me, would you have done otherwise? I turned my back on him and started walking across the room. Nine quick steps from the corner to the opposite wall. Back again. Nine more quick steps. I stopped in front of Snaut: "Look, we'll write a report. We'll ask for an immediate link with the Council. It's a

feasible. They'll agree. They must agree. The planet will no longer be subject to the regulations of the Four. Anything goes. We'll bring in antimatter generators. Do you think there's any body that can withstand antimatter? There isn't! Nothing resists antimatter, nothing, nothing, nothing! - I screamed and tears blinded me. - Do you want to destroy it? Why do you want to destroy it? - Go away, leave me! - No, I won't go out. - Snaut! - I stared at him; he shook his head. - What do you want? What do you want from me? He moved back to the table: - Fine, we'll write a report. I started walking again. - Sit down!" he ordered. - Leave me alone! - There are two separate issues. First, the facts; second, our wishes. - And we have to talk about that now? - Yes, now. - I don't want to hear anything. Do you understand? I'm not interested in your distinctions. - We sent our last communiqu√© about two months ago, before Gibarian's death. We'd have to establish exactly how it came about... I grabbed his arm: - Will you shut up, yes? - Hit me if you want, I won't shut up. I let go of him: - Oh, talk all you like... - Well, listen!... Sartorius will try to hide certain facts... I'm almost sure of it. - And you won't hide anything? - No, I won't. Not any more. This case goes beyond personal responsibility. You know that as well as I do... He" has shown thoughtful activity. He is capable of organic synthesis at the highest level, a synthesis

that we ourselves have never achieved. He knows the structure, the microstructure, the metabolism of our body... - Indeed... Why do you stop talking? He has performed a series of experiments on us. Psychic vivisection. He used knowledge, which he stole from us, without taking into account our aspirations. - These are no longer facts, Kelvin, or even propositions. They are hypotheses. In a sense, he has taken into account the desires locked away in some secret corner of our minds. Perhaps he has sent us... gifts. - Gifts! Good heavens! An irrepressible laugh shook me, I howled with laughter. Snaut grabbed my hand: - Calm down! I squeezed his fingers; I heard the bones crack. He looked at me impassively, his eyelids wrinkled. I moved away and took refuge in a corner of the workshop. With my face turned towards the wall, I said: - I will try to dominate myself. - Yes, of course... I understand. What do we ask of them? - It's up to you... I can't concentrate now... Did she say anything before? - No, she didn't. If you ask me, we now have a chance. - A chance? What chance? A chance to... Ah... - Again I looked him in the face and suddenly I understood. - The Contact? Contact again? So you're not over the moon about this madhouse! What more do you need... Contact? No, no and no, don't count on me! - Why not?" he said calmly. You yourself, instinctively, and at this very moment more than ever, treat him like a human being. You hate him. - And you don't? - No, Kelvin, no... He is blind... I repeated: - Blind? I wasn't sure I had heard correctly.

- Or rather, he 'sees' differently from us. We don't exist for him in the same way as we exist for each other. We recognise each other by the appearance of the face, the body... For him, this appearance is a translucent glass. It goes straight into the brain. - Well, so what? What are you getting at? If he has managed to recreate a human being who exists only in my memory, and in such a way that his eyes, his gestures, his voice... his voice... - Go on! Speak! - I'm talking... I'm talking... The voice... the voice... because he is able to read us like a book... Do you understand what I mean? - Yes, that he could get along with us. - Isn't it obvious? - No. It's not obvious at all. He may have used a recipe that is expressed in other ways than words. As a record in the memory, this recipe is in the form of a protein structure, comparable to a zoosperm or an egg. In the brain, there are no words, no feelings; man's memory is a repertoire written in terms of nucleic acids on asynchronous large-molecule crystals. "He' has picked up the deepest, most isolated, most 'assimilated' imprint, without necessarily knowing what it means to us. Let's say I am able to reproduce the architecture of a symmetriad, that I know the materials of which it is composed, and that I have the technological means to operate efficiently... I create a symmetriad and I throw it into the ocean. But I don't know why I'm doing this, I don't know what it's for, I don't know what it means to him... - Yes, I say, maybe you're right. In that case, he didn't want to hurt us, he wasn't trying to destroy us... Yes, that's possible. And without any intention... My lips began to tremble. - Kelvin! - Yes, yes, don't worry! You are good, and the ocean is good. Everyone is good. But why? Explain to me!

Why, why did he do it? What did you tell her... her? - I told her the truth. - The truth, the truth!... What? - You know what... come to my place, we'll write the report! Come on, let's go! - Wait, wait, wait! What exactly do you want? You don't intend to stay in the Station, do you? - Yes, I want to stay.
