The next day, returning from lunch, I found a note from Snaut on the table under the window. It reported that Sartorius had refrained from working on the annihilator for the time being, in order to carry out as a last test the illumination of the ocean with a burst of hard rays.
- 'Darling,' I said, 'I must go to Snaut.
The red east was bitter in the panes and divided the room in two. We were in a bluish shadow. Beyond its boundary, everything seemed like copper; you would have thought that any book, falling from a shelf, would have made a rippling sound.
- It's all about the experiment. I just don't know how to do it. I would prefer, you understand... - I broke off.
- Don't explain yourself, Kris. I would so like to... If it wouldn't take long?
- It has to take a while,' I said. - Look, what if you came with me and waited in the corridor?
- Fine. But, if I can't stand it?
- What's it actually like? - I asked and added quickly: - 'I'm not asking out of curiosity, you understand, but, perhaps, having figured it out, you could control it yourself.
- It is fear,' she said. She went a little pale. - I can't even say what I'm afraid of, because I'm not actually afraid, I'm just, I'm just losing myself. At the last moment I still feel such, such shame, I don't know how to tell you. And then nothing. That's why I thought it was some kind of illness.... - she finished more quietly and shuddered.
- 'It could be that it's only like that here on this cursed Station,' I said. - As far as I'm concerned, I'll do my best to leave it as soon as possible.
- Do you think that's possible? - she opened her eyes.
- Why not? After all, I'm not chained here.... Besides, it will also depend on what I agree with Snaut. How long do you think you can be alone?
- It depends... - she said slowly. She lowered her head. - If I can hear your voice, I think I can manage.
- I'd rather you didn't hear what we were saying. Not that I have anything to hide from you, but I don't know, I can't know what Snaut will say.
- Don't finish. I understand. Good. I'll stand so that I can only hear the sound of your voice. That's enough for me.
- I'll call him from the studio now. I'll leave the door open. - She nodded. I went out through a wall of red sunlight into the corridor, due to the contrast almost black despite the artificial lighting. The door of the small workshop stood open. The mirrored remains of a Dewar thermos lying on the floor beneath a row of large reservoirs of liquid oxygen were the last vestige of the night's accidents. The small screen glowed as I took off the handset and dialled the radio station. The bluish film of light, coating the frosted glass as if from within, cracked and Snaut, sideways leaning over the railing of the high chair, looked me straight in the eye.
- 'Hello,' he said.
- I read the card. I would like to speak to you. Can I come?
- You can. Right away?
- Yes.
- Please. Are you... in company?
- No.
His tan-brown, lean face, with thick transverse wrinkles on his forehead, in the convex glass tilted obliquely, as if he were a strange fish living in the aquarium from which he was peering out through the glass, took on an ambiguous expression.
- Well, well,' he said. - So I'm waiting.
- 'We can go, darling,' I began with not quite natural liveliness, entering the cabin through red streaks of light, behind which I could see only Harey's faint silhouette. My voice failed me; she sat slumped in her chair, interlacing her elbows under the railing.
Whether she heard my footsteps too late, or whether she couldn't relax that shrill spasm fast enough to assume a normal pose, enough that I saw her for a second, struggling 7. with that incomprehensible force within her, and my heart was choked with blind, frantic anger mixed with pity. We walked silently down a long corridor, passing sections of it, covered in variously coloured enamel, which was intended - by the architects - to add variety to the stay in the armoured shell. Already from a distance I saw the door of the radio station ajar. A long streak of red was falling from them into the corridor, as the sun was also reaching here. I looked at Harey, who did not even try to smile; I could see her all the way, focused, preparing to fight herself. The approaching effort had already changed her face, which had gone pale and seemed to have diminished. A few steps from the door she stopped, I turned to her, with my very fingertips she pushed me lightly to go, and at once my plans, the Snaut, the experiment, the whole Station, everything seemed nothing to me in the face of the ordeal she had come here to face. I felt like a torturer and was already about to turn back when a broad sunny streak, refracted on the corridor wall, was obscured by a human shadow. Accelerating my stride, I entered the cabin. The snaut was just beyond the threshold, as if heading to meet me. The red sun stood in a straight line behind him and a purple dawn seemed to radiate from his grey hair. We stared at each other for a good moment, saying nothing. He was studying my face, as it were. His expression I could not see, blinded by the glare of the window. I walked around him and stood next to the tall lectern from which the flexible stalks of microphones protruded. He turned slowly on the spot, following me calmly with that slight curve of his lips, which actually almost without changing became once a smile and once a grimace of fatigue. Without taking his eyes off me, he walked over to a whole-walled metal cupboard in front of which piles of spare radio parts, thermal batteries and tools were piled up on both sides as if in a hurry, he pulled a chair there and sat down, leaning his back against the enamel door.
The silence we had maintained so far was already becoming strange, to say the least. I listened in, concentrating my attention on the silence filling the corridor where Harey had been left, but not the faintest murmur came from there.
- When will you be ready? - I asked.
- We could even start today, but the recording will still take some time, - Recording? You mean the encephalogram?
- Yes, you agreed. Why? - He suspended his voice.
- No, nothing.
- I'm listening to you,' Snaut spoke up as the silence began to grow between us again. - She already knows ... about herself - I lowered my voice almost to a whisper. He raised his eyebrows.
- 'Yes?
I got the impression that he wasn't really surprised. Why was he pretending then? In an instant I felt sick of talking, but I persisted. Let it be loyalty, I thought, if nothing else.
- She had started guessing probably from our conversation in the library, watched me, added one thing to another, then found Gibarian's tape recorder and listened to the tape....
He didn't change his position, still leaning against the cabinet, but there was a tiny glint in his eyes. Standing at the desktop, I had a wing of the door in front of me, ajar to the corridor. I lowered my voice even further:
- That night, while I was sleeping, she tried to kill herself. Liquid oxygen...
Something rustled like a draught in the loose papers. I was immobile, listening to what was in the corridor, but the source of the rustling was closer. It rattled like a mouse.... A mouse! Nonsense. There were no mice here. I watched from under my eyes the seated man.
- I'm listening - he said calmly.
- 'Of course, she didn't make it... in any case, she knows who she is.
- Why are you telling me this? - he asked suddenly. I didn't know at first what to say.
- 'I want you to know... to know how it is,' I muttered.
- I warned you.
- You want to say that you knew - I raised my voice in spite of myself.
- No. Of course you didn't. But I explained to you how it is. Every 'visitor', when he turns up, is almost a phantom, except for a disjointed jumble of memories and images, drawn from his.... Adam... is actually - empty. The longer he is here with you, the more he humanises himself. It also becomes more independent, up to certain limits, one is supposed to understand. Therefore, the longer it goes on, the more difficult it becomes....
He paused. He looked at me blankly and said:
- She knows everything?
- Yes, I already told you.
- Everything? And that she's been here once before and that you....
- No! He smiled.
- 'Kelvin, listen, if you've got to this point... what are you actually going to do? Leave the Station?
- Yes.
- With her?
- Yes.
He was silent, as if contemplating an answer, but there was something else in his silence.... what? Again that indistinct breeze rustled just as if behind a thin wall. He moved in his chair.
- Excellent,' he said. - What are you looking at? Did you think I was going to stand in your way? You do as you please, my dear. We'd look pretty if, on top of everything else, we started to use coercion here! I'm not going to convince you, I'll just tell you this: you are trying - in an inhuman situation - to behave like a human being. That may be beautiful, but it is futile. Besides, I am not sure about this beauty either, because can what is stupid be beautiful? But that's not the point. You give up on further experience, you want to leave, taking it away. Yes?
- Yes.
- But that is also an... experience. Do you think?
- How do you understand it? Will she... be able to...? If together with me, I don't see....
I spoke slower and slower until I broke off. Snaut sighed slightly.
- 'We're all playing ostrich politics here, Kelvin, but at least we know that and we're not posing as noble.
- I'm not posing as anything.
- OK, I didn't mean to offend you. I take back what I said about nobility, but ostrich politics remains in place. You are practising it in a particularly dangerous form. You lie to yourself and to her, and to yourself again. Do you know the conditions for stabilising a system made of neutri-new matter?
- No. And you do not know. Nobody knows that.
- Of course. But one thing we do know is that such a system is impermanent and can only exist thanks to a continuous supply of energy. I know this from Sartorius. This energy produces a dislocated stabilising field. Well: is this field external to the 'guest'? Or is the source of this field within his body? Do you comprehend the difference?
- Yes - I said slowly. - If it is external, then... she, it's... such a...
- It is when moving away from Solaris that the system will fall apart - he finished for me. - 'We can't predict that, but you've done the experiment after all. That rocket you fired... it's still circulating, you know. I even calculated the elements of its movement in my spare time. You can fly, go into orbit, get close to it, and then you can see what happened to the... passenger...
- You're crazy! - I hissed.
- Is that what you think? Well... what if... get her down here, this racket? It can be done. It's remote-controlled. We bring it down from orbit and...
- Stop it!
- Also, no? So there is one way, very simple. It doesn't even have to land on the Station. Yes, let her orbit on. We'll just connect with her by radio; if she's alive, she'll call back and....
- But, but that's where the oxygen ran out a long time ago! - I mouthed...
- Maybe she's getting around without oxygen. Well, shall we try?
- Snaut... Snaut..,
- Kclvin... Kelvin... - he was teasing me angrily. - Come to think of it, what kind of person are you? Who do you want to make happy? To save? Yourself? Her? Which one? This one or that one? Don't you have the courage for both? You see for yourself where this leads! I'm telling you for the last time: this, here, is an extramoral situation.
Suddenly I heard the same scraping sound as before, as if someone was scratching at the wall with their fingernails. I don't know why I was overwhelmed by a kind of passive, mulish stillness. It was as if I was viewing the whole situation, the two of us, everything from a great distance through upturned binoculars: petty, ridiculous a little, unimportant.
- So fine,' I said. - And what do you think I should do? Remove it? She'll turn up the same tomorrow, won't she? And again? And so every day? For how long? For what? What's in it for me? What's in it for you? Sartorius? The station?
- No, you answer me first. You will take off with her and, shall we say, witness the following transformation. In a few minutes you will see before you...
- Well, what? - I said with a sneer. - A monster? A demon, eh?
- No. The usual, most ordinary agony. Do you really believe in their immortality anymore?
I assure you, they die... What will you do then? Go back for... reserve?
- Stop it!!! - I roared clenching my fist.
He looked at me with indulgent derision in his squinted eyes.
- Ah, am I the one who's supposed to stop? You know, if I were you, I'd give this conversation a rest. You'd be better off doing something else, you could be chopping up the ocean with rods - with a vengeance - for example. What do you mean! So, if - he made a filial gesture of farewell with his hand, raising his eyes to the ceiling at the same time, as if he were following some distant figure - you're going rogue? And so, won't you? To smile when you feel like howling, to feign joy and peace when you want to bite your fingers, then you're not a scoundrel? And what if you can't not be here? What then? You're going to rage in front of Snaut, who's to blame for everything, right? Well, then on top of that you're still an idiot, my dear....
- You're talking about yourself," I said with a lowered head. - I... I love her.
- Who? Your memory.
- No. Her. I told you what she wanted to do. That's not what any... a real person.
- You admit it yourself, saying...
- Don't mince my words.
- Good. So she loves you. And you want to love her. It's not the same thing.
- You're wrong.
- Kelvin, I'm sorry, but you have entered into these intimate affairs of yours. You don't love. You love. She's ready to give up her life. So are you. Very touching, very beautiful, noble, everything you want. But there's no room for all that. There isn't. Do you understand? No, you don't want to understand it. You are caught up, through forces beyond your control, in a circular process of which she is a part. A phase. A repetitive rhythm. If she were... if you were being stalked by a mascot ready to do anything for you, you wouldn't hesitate for a moment to remove her. Right?
- True.
- So, then, maybe that's why she's not such a mascot! That ties your hands? That's the whole point of having your hands tied!
- It's one more hypothesis to the million out there in the library. Snaut, come on, she's.... no.
I don't want to talk about it with you.
- Good. You started it yourself. But just think, she is essentially a mirror in which part of your brain is reflected. If she's great, it's because great was your memory.
You gave the recipe. A circular process, don't forget!
- So what do you want from me? For me to... to remove it? I already asked you: why should I do it? You didn't answer.
- So I'll answer you now. I didn't invite you to this conversation. I have not touched your business. I am not ordering you or forbidding you anything and I would not do it even if I could. It was you, you who came here and laid everything out in front of me, and do you know why? No, to get it off my chest. To knock it off. I know the burden, my dear! Yes, yes, don't interrupt me! I'm not interrupting you with anything, but you, you want me to interrupt you. If I stood in your way, maybe you'd smash my head in too, then you'd be dealing with me, someone made of the same blood and clay as you, and you'd feel like a man yourself. And so... you can't live up to that and that's why you're debating with me.... and in fact with yourself! Just tell me again that you would be bent on suffering if she disappeared all at once, no, don't say anything.
- Well, you know! I've come to tell you by simple loyalty that I intend to leave the Station with her,' I countered his attack, but I sounded unconvinced myself. Snaut shrugged his shoulders.
- 'It's very possible that you have to stay with yours. If I have spoken at all on the matter, it is only because you are going higher and higher, and the fall from the heights, you understand yourself.... Come tomorrow morning around nine o'clock upstairs to Sartorius.... Will you come?
- To Sartorius?-I was surprised. - After all, he doesn't let anyone in, you said you couldn't even telephone.
- Now he's managed somehow. We don't talk about it, you know. You are... it's quite different. Well, less so. Will you come in the morning?
- I'll come," I muttered. I looked at Snaut. His left hand, as if unwillingly, was hiding behind the wardrobe door. When had it swung open? Probably quite a long time ago, but in the excitement of this dreadful conversation for me I paid no attention to it. How unnatural it looked.... As if... He was hiding something there. Or as if someone was holding his hand. I licked my lips.
- Snaut, what are you....
- Come out - he said quietly, very calmly. - Come out.
I went out and closed the door behind me in the last of the red glow. Harey was sitting on the floor, about ten paces away, against the wall itself. She broke off at the sight of me. - Do you see...? - She said looking at me with sparkling eyes. - 'We did it, Kris... I'm so. happy. Maybe... maybe it will get better and better...
- Oh, for sure - I replied absentmindedly. We were getting back together, and I was cracking my head over this idiotic wardrobe. So, so he was hiding in there...? And all this talk...? My cheeks started to burn so much that I rubbed them in spite of myself. God, what madness. And where did it actually stop? Nothing? True, tomorrow morning...
And suddenly I was gripped by fear, almost like last night. My encephalogram. The complete record of all brain processes, translated into fluctuations of a bunch of rays, will be sent down. Into the depths of this infinite, boundless monster. As he said: "if it disappeared, you would suffer terribly, eh...?". The encephalogram is a total record. Also the unconscious processes. If I want it to disappear, die? Would I otherwise be so horrified that she survived this terrible assassination? Can one be responsible for one's own subconscious? If I am not responsible for her, who would be? What idiocy! Why on earth did I agree that precisely my, my.... I can naturally study it for myself beforehand, this record, but I can't read it. Nobody can do that. Specialists can only determine what the researcher was thinking about, but these are only generalities: that, for example, he was solving a mathematical problem, but they can't say what kind of problem. They claim it's impossible, because the encephalogram is a resultant, a mixture of a whole lot of simultaneous processes, and only some of them have a mental "lining"... And the subconscious... They don't want to talk about these at all, and where are they already in reading someone's memories, repressed or not repressed.... But why am I so afraid? After all, I myself said to Harey this morning that this experiment won't do anything. Well, because if our neurophysiologists can't read the recording, where would this most alien, black, liquid giant....
But he entered me nor do I know how, to traverse my entire memory and invent its most painful atom. How can I doubt that. And this without any help, without any
"radial transmission", he forced his way through the double encapsulated armour, through the heavy shells of the Station, searched inside my body and left with his loot....
- Kris...? - quietly spoke up Harey. I stood at the window, gazing with unseeing eyes into the beginning of the night. Faint at this latitude, a delicate whiteness obscured the stars. A uniform, though thin, coating of clouds so high that the sun, from deep below the horizon, bestowed upon them the faintest pink-silver scorch.
If it disappears later, it will mean that I wanted it. That I killed it. Not to go there? They can't make me. But what will I tell them? This - no. I can't. Yes, you have to pretend, you have to lie, over and over again. But that is because there are thoughts, intentions, hopes, cruel, wonderful, murderous, in me, perhaps, and I know nothing about them. Man has set out to meet other worlds, other civilisations, without fully knowing his own nooks and crannies, blind roads, wells, barricaded, dark doors. To hand her over to them ... out of shame? To give it away just because I lack the courage?
- Kris... - whispered Harey even more quietly than before. I felt rather than heard her silently approach me, and I pretended not to know anything about it. At that moment I wanted to be alone. I needed to be alone. I had not yet conquered anything, no decision, no resolution had been made. Gazing up at the darkening sky, at the stars that were but the spectral shadow of earthly stars, I stood motionless, and in the emptiness that replaced the chase of thoughts from a moment before, grew the wordless, indifferent certainty that where I could not reach, I had already chosen and, pretending that nothing had happened, I did not even have the strength to despise myself.
