I hastily folded in four and put Gibarian's notes in my pocket. I walked slowly over to the wardrobe and looked inside - overalls and clothes were crammed and stuffed into one corner, as if someone was standing there. A corner of an envelope was sticking out from under a pile of papers on the floor. I picked it up. It was addressed to me. With my throat suddenly clenched, I tore open the envelope and had to struggle to unfold the small sheet of paper stuck inside.
In his regular, remarkably fine but legible handwriting, Gibarian noted:
Ann. Solar. Vol. I. Anex, also: Vot. Sepa-rat. Messenger in spr. F.; 'Ravintzer's Little Apocrypha.' That was all, not a single word more. The writing bore traces of haste. Was it some important message? When had he written it? I thought I had to go to the library as soon as possible. I knew about this appendix to the first solary yearbook, that is, I knew of its existence, but I had never had it in my hand, as it represented purely historical value.
On the other hand, I had never even heard of any Ra-vintzer or his "Little Apocrypha".
What to do?
I'm already a quarter of an hour late. Once again, from the doorway, I took in the whole room with my eyes. Only now did I notice the folding bed fixed vertically to the wall, because it was obscured by an unrolled map of
Solaris. Behind the map something was hanging. It was a pocket tape recorder in a case. I took out the camera,
hung the case in its former place, and slipped the tape recorder into my pocket. I looked at the counter - almost the entire reel was recorded.
Again I stood at the door for a second with my eyes closed, listening with effort to the silence outside. Nothing. I opened the door, the corridor seemed a black pit, I took off my dark glasses only now and saw the faint ceiling lights. I closed the door behind me and walked to the left, towards the radio station.
I was approaching the circular chamber from which the corridors spread out in the shape of the spokes of a wheel, when, passing some narrow side passage leading, it seems, to the bathrooms, I saw a large, indistinct figure almost merging with the twilight.
I stopped as if caught off guard. From the depths of this offshoot walked an enormous black woman with an unhurried, duck-like gait. I saw the flash of her whites and almost simultaneously heard the soft, barefoot patter of her feet. She wore nothing but a shiny yellowish skirt, as if made of straw; she had huge, sagging breasts, and her black arms rivalled the thighs of a normal man; she passed me without even looking in my direction - at a metre's distance - and went, swinging her elephantine orbs, similar to those Stone Age steatopygic sculptures one sometimes sees in anthropological museums. Where the corridor curved, she turned sideways and disappeared into the door of Gibarian's cabin. As she opened it, she stood for a blink in the stronger light that burned in the room. The door closed quietly and I was left alone. With my right hand I grasped the knuckle of my left and squeezed it with all my might until the bones crunched. I looked around unconsciously at my surroundings. What had happened? What was that? As suddenly as if someone had hit me, I remembered Snaut's warning. What did that mean? Who was this brooding Aphrodite? Where had she come from? I took one, just one step towards Gibarian's cabin and became immobile. I knew all too well that I would not go in there. I fished the air with dilated nostrils. Something didn't feel right, something was wrong - ah! Instinctively, I expected the foul, distinct stench of her sweat, but even as she passed me by with a step, I felt nothing. I don't know how long I stood leaning against the cool metal of the wall. Silence filled the station, and the only sound I heard was the distant, monotonous sound of the air-conditioning compressors.
I slapped my face lightly with my open hand and walked slowly to the radio station. As I pressed the door handle, I heard a sharp voice:
- Who's there?
- It was me, Kelvin.
He was sitting at a table between a stack of aluminium boxes and the transmitter desk, eating meat concentrate straight from the can. I don't know why he had chosen the radio station as his home. I stood, stupefied, at the door, staring at his chewing jaws and suddenly I felt how hungry I was. I walked over to the shelves, selected the least dusty one from the stack of plates and sat down opposite him. We ate in silence for a while, then Snaut stood up, took a thermos from the wall cupboard and poured us each a glass of hot broth. Putting the thermos on the floor, there was no more room on the table, he asked:
- Have you seen Sartorius?
- No. Where is he?
- Upstairs.
Upstairs was the laboratory. We ate on, silently, until the plate clattered in the emptied tin. Night reigned in the radio station. The window was closed tight from the outside, four circular fluorescent lights were burning under the ceiling. Their reflections vibrated in the plastic cover of the transmitter. The taut skin on Snaut's cheekbones was marked with red veins. He was now wearing a black, loose, frayed jumper.
- 'Is there something for you? - He asked.
- No. What should I be?
- You were sweating.
I wiped my forehead with my hand. I was indeed dripping with sweat; it must have been a reaction after the previous shock. He looked at me investigatively. Was I supposed to tell him? I preferred him to show me more confidence himself. Who was playing against whom here and in what incomprehensible way?
- It's hot," I said. - I supposed the air conditioning was working better in your place.
- It will even out in about an hour. Are you sure it's just from the heat? - He raised his eyes at me.
I chewed conscientiously, as if I hadn't seen it.
- What are you going to do? - He finally asked when we had finished eating. He threw the whole dish and the empty cans into the washstand against the wall and returned to his chair.
- I will comply with you,' I replied phlegmatically. - Do you have a research plan after all? Some new stimulus, supposedly an X-ray or something, no?
- X-ray? - He raised his eyebrows. - Where did you hear about that?
- I can't remember anymore. Someone told me. Maybe on Prometheus. Why? Are you doing it already?
- I don't know the details. It was Gibarian's idea. He started it with Sartorius. But how can you know about it? He shrugged his shoulders.
- You don't know the details? You should be there, after all it falls within your scope - I didn't finish. He was silent. The whining coming from the air-conditioners had quietened down, and the temperature too was kept at a bearable level. All that hung in the air was a constant high-pitched tone, like the buzzing of a dying fly. Snaut stood up, walked over to the control panel and began to flick contacts without any sense, as the main switch stood in the dead position. He fiddled like this for a while until, without turning his head, he noticed:
- The formalities will have to be completed in connection with this.... you know.
- Yes?
He turned and looked at me as if close to rage. I can't say that I was deliberately trying to get him off balance, but not understanding anything about the game that was going on here, I preferred to be restrained. A bony grin walked over his black jumper tube.
- 'You've been to Gibarian,' he said suddenly. It wasn't a question. I raised my eyebrows and looked him calmly in the face.
- 'You were in his room,' he repeated. I made a small movement of my head, as if I were saying 'let's say', 'let's put it that way'. I wanted him to go on talking.
- Who was there? - he asked.
He knew about her!!!
- Nobody. And who could have been there? - I asked.
- Then why didn't you let me in? I smiled.
- Because I was frightened. After your warning, when the handle moved, I held it reflexively. Why didn't you say it was you? I would have let you in.
- I thought it was Sartorius,' he said uncertainly.
- 'So what of it?
- What do you think about ... what happened there? - He countered the question with a question. I hesitated.
- You must know better than me. Where is he?
- In the cold room - he answered immediately. - We moved him just this morning ... because of the heat.
- Where did you find it?
- In the wardrobe.
- In the wardrobe? Was he dead?
- His heart was still beating, but he wasn't breathing. It was agony.
- Did you try to save him?
- No.
- Why? He hesitated.
- I didn't make it. He died before I put him down.
- Was he standing in the wardrobe? Between those overalls?
- Yes.
He walked over to a small desk in the corner and brought a sheet lying on it. He laid it down in front of me. - 'I wrote down a kind of makeshift protocol,' he said. - It's even good for you to have a look around the room. Cause of death... injection of a lethal dose of pernostal. Here you have it written down...
I ran my eyes over the short text.
- Suicide... - I repeated quietly. - And the cause...?
- Disorder... depression... or whatever you want to call it. You know better than I do.
- I only know what I see myself - I replied and looked down into his eyes, as he stood over me.
- What do you mean by that? - he asked calmly.
- He injected himself with pernostal and hid in the wardrobe, yes? If that was the case, it's not depression, not any kind of disorder, but acute psychosis. Para-noia... He probably thought he saw something.... - I spoke more and more slowly, looking into his eyes.
He walked away to the radio desk and started snapping contacts again.
- 'Here's your signature,' I spoke up after a moment's silence. - And Sartorius?
- He's in the lab. I've already told you. He doesn't show up: I suppose. - That what?
- That he has shut himself away.
- Shut up? Ah. He has shut up. Please. Maybe he barricaded himself in?
- Maybe.
- Snaut... - I said - there's someone on the Station.
- Did you see!
He looked at me, bent over.
- You warned me. From whom? Is this a hallucination?
- What did you see!?
- It's a man, huh?
He was silent. He turned towards the wall, as if he didn't want me to observe his face. He drummed his fingers on the metal partition. I looked at his hands. There was no longer a trace of blood on his knuckles. I experienced a brief, like a flash, daze.
- 'This person is real,' I said quietly, almost in a whisper, as if, I was telling him a secret that could be overheard. - What can be ... can be touched. She can be... hurt... The last time you saw her was today.
- How do you know!?
He didn't turn around. He was standing against the very wall, touching her breast, just as my words hit him.
- Immediately before I landed.... Not long before...?
He shrank back as if from a blow. I saw his crazed eyes.
- You?!!! - he mouthed - who are YOU!!!?
He looked as if he wanted to pounce on me. This was not what I had expected. The situation came to a head. He didn't believe I was who I said I was? What was that supposed to mean! He looked at me with utmost horror. Was it madness already? Poisoning? Anything was becoming possible. But I had seen it - this creature, and therefore myself .... also...?
- Who was it? - I asked. The words reassured him. For a moment he looked at me investigatively, as if he did not yet believe me. I already knew it was a false stroke and that he would not answer me before he even opened his mouth.
He sat down slowly in his chair and squeezed his head with his hands.
- What's going on here...? - he said quietly. - Maligna...
- Who was it? - I asked again.
- If you don't know... - he muttered.
- Then what?
- It's nothing.
- Snaut - I said - we're far enough away from home. Let's play o-hole cards. It's all convoluted anyway.
- What do you mean?
- To tell you who you saw.
- And you...? - he chuckled suspiciously.
- You're chasing a heel. I'll tell you and you'll tell me. Rest assured, I won't take you for a madman, because I know....
- Crazy! Great God! - tried to laugh. - Man, but you're nothing, absolutely nothing.... but what a salvation that would be. If he had believed for a moment that it was madness, he wouldn't have done it, he would have lived....
- So what you wrote in the protocol about the disorder is a lie?
- Of course!
- Why don't you write the truth?
- Why...? - he repeated.
Silence fell. Again I was in complete darkness, comprehending nothing, and for a moment I thought I could convince him and together we would attack the riddle. Why, why did he not want to talk!
- Where are the automatons? - I spoke up.
- In the warehouses. We have closed all of them except for the airport staff.
- Why?
Again, he didn't answer.
- You won't say?
- I can't.
There was an element of it that I couldn't grasp. Why not go upstairs to Sarto-rius?
At once I remembered the card and that seemed to be the most important thing at the moment.
- Can you imagine continuing to work under these conditions? - I asked. He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.
- What does it matter?
- Oh yeah? So what are you going to do? He remained silent. In the silence the distant sound of barefoot footsteps could be heard. In the midst of nickel and plastic apparatuses, tall cabinets of electron apparatus, glass, precision instruments, this clattering, sprawling gait sounded like a clownish trick of someone out of his mind. The stepping was getting closer. I stood up, watching Snaut with the utmost tension. He was listening with his eyes squinted into slits, but did not seem frightened at all. So wasn't she the one he was afraid of?
- Where did she come from? - I asked. And when he hesitated: - Don't you want to say?
- I don't know.
- Well.
The footsteps moved away and became quiet.
- Don't you believe me? - he said. - I give you my word I don't know.
Silently, I opened the wardrobe of suits and began to unzip their heavy, empty shells. As I expected, deep inside, on hooks, hung gas pistols, used to move in a gravityless vacuum. They weren't worth much, but they represented some kind of weapon after all. I preferred one to none. I inspected the hold and slung the lash of the case over my shoulder. Snaut watched me closely. When I adjusted the length of the lash, he showed his yellow teeth in a mocking smile.
- Happy hunting! - he said.
- Thank you for everything,' I replied, walking to the door. He sprang up from his seat.
- Kelvin!
I looked at him. He was no longer smiling. I don't know if I've ever seen such a tormented face.
- Kelvin, it's not... I... I really can't - he mumbled. I waited to see if he would say anything else, but he only moved his lips as if he wanted to get something out of them.
I turned around and left without another word.
