Three weeks passed. The window shutters were lowered and raised at fixed times. At night, I was a prisoner of my nightmares. And, each morning, the comedy began again. But was it a comedy? I was composing myself a peaceful appearance, and Harey was playing the same game; we deceived each other, knowingly, and this agreement served our ultimate escape: we discussed the future, our life on Earth, our installation in the vicinity of a big city. We would no longer leave the Earth, we would spend the rest of our existence under the blue sky and among the green trees. Together, we imagined the layout of our house, the layout of the garden; we were arguing over details, the location of a hedge or a bench… Was I sincere for a single moment? No. I knew our plans were impossible. I knew it. For even if Harey had been able to leave the Station and survive the trip, how would I have got through the security checkpoints with my stowaway? Earth only welcomes humans, and every human being must have proper papers. At the first check, Harey would be detained, to try to establish his identity; we would be separated and Harey would immediately betray himself. The Station was the only place where we could live together. Did Harey know? Surely. Did someone tell him? Yeah, probably… One night I heard Harey slowly getting up. I wanted to hold her back – in the dark and the silence, we still sometimes freed ourselves for a moment from despair, from escaping the torture of oblivion. Harey hadn&#39;t noticed that I had woken up. When I stretched out my arm, she was already standing. Barefoot, she walked towards the door. I felt a confused anguish; Not daring to raise my voice, I whispered, “Harey…” I sat down on the bed. Harey had gone out, leaving the door ajar: a thin wall of light cut obliquely into the room. I thought I heard whispers. Harey was talking with someone… Who? I jumped out of bed, but mad terror gripped me, and my legs refused to move. I listened; I no longer heard any noise. I let myself fall back onto the sheet. Blood pounded my temples. I started counting. I was coming to a thousand, when the door panel parted. Harey entered, closed the door silently, and stood motionless for a moment. I tried to breathe regularly. She called quietly, “Kris! I didn&#39;t answer. She quickly slipped into bed and lay down next to me, careful not to touch me. I did not move; in my head, I formed questions, but I refused to speak first. How long did I stay like that, asking silent questions? An hour maybe. Then I fell asleep. The morning was like so many other mornings; I watched Harey furtively; I saw no change in his behavior. After lunch, we sat facing the large panoramic window; the Station sailed among purple clouds. Harey was reading a book; staring straight ahead, I suddenly realized that by tilting my head at a certain angle I saw our double reflection in the glass. I removed my hand from the grab bar. Harey had no idea I was watching her in the window: she glanced at me and, from my attitude, evidently judged that I was gazing at the ocean. So she leaned quickly over to the grab bar and kissed the spot my hand had just touched. The next moment she was reading her book again. &quot;Harey,&quot; I asked quietly, &quot;where did you go last night?&quot; - Tonight ? - Yes. “You…you were dreaming, Kris, I haven&#39;t been anywhere. &quot;Didn&#39;t you go out?&quot; - No ... you must have dreamed. - Maybe ... yes, I may have dreamed ... In the evening, I began to talk about our trip, the return to Earth. Harey interrupted me, &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me about that trip again, Kris!&quot; I don&#39;t want to hear about it anymore, you know… — What? - No nothing. When we were in bed, she told me she was thirsty: &quot;There&#39;s a glass of syrup over there on the table, would you give it to me, please?&quot; She drank half the glass, then handed it to me. I was not thirsty. She smiles: — Drink to my health! I drank the syrup, which seemed a little salty, but my mind was elsewhere: - Harey ... - She had just turned off the lamp. “Harey, since you don&#39;t want to talk about our trip anymore, let&#39;s talk about something else! &quot;If I didn&#39;t exist, would you get married?&quot; - No. - Never ? - Never. - Why ? - I do not know. I was single for ten years, and I never remarried. Let&#39;s not talk about that, darling… My head was spinning, like I&#39;d had too much wine. - No, let&#39;s talk about it! What if I asked you to do it? &quot;To get married?&quot; What an absurd idea, Harey! I don&#39;t need anyone but you. She leaned over me; his breath brushed my lips; she hugged me with all her might: &#39;Say it differently!&#39; - I like you. His head fell on my arm; I felt tears. &quot;Harey, what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; - Nothing ... nothing ... nothing ..., she repeated more and more quietly. My eyes were closing. The red dawn woke me up. My head was heavy and my neck stiff, as if the vertebrae had fused together. The pasty tongue, I swallowed a bitter saliva. What could I have poisoned myself with? I stretched out my arm towards Harey; my hand felt a cold sheet. I jumped up. I was alone – alone in the bed, alone in the cabin. The curved glass reflected a row of red suns. I jumped to the ground. Staggering like a drunken man, clinging to the furniture, I reached the sliding wardrobe; the bathroom was empty. The rotunda was empty. There was no one in the workshop. &quot;Harey!&quot; Waving my arms, I ran around and called out to him. One last time I yelled, “Harey! And my voice choked: I already knew the truth… I don&#39;t remember exactly what happened next. Half-naked, I ran from one end of the Station to the other. I seem to remember even going into the central refrigeration plant, exploring the warehouse stores. I knocked with closed fists against the locked doors. I moved away, then I came back to bump into the doors that had already resisted me. I tumbled down the stairs, I fell, I got up, I rushed I don&#39;t know where, forward... A glass wall slid open: I had arrived at the double armored door which opened onto the ocean. I attacked the door; I was shouting ; I still hoped that I was dreaming. For a while, someone had been beside me; someone was clinging to me, dragging me away… I found myself stretched out on a metal table in the small workshop. I was panting. A vapor of alcohol burned my nostrils and throat. My shirt was soaked in icy water, my hair stuck to my skull. Snaut was busy in front of a medicine cabinet; he moved instruments and glass utensils, which clashed with an intolerable din. Suddenly, I saw him above me; he looked me seriously in the eyes. - Where is she ? “She&#39;s not here. “But… Harey…” He hunched over, brought his face closer, and said slowly, very distinctly, “Harey is dead. I closed my eyes and whispered: &#39;She&#39;ll be back… I wasn&#39;t afraid of her coming back; I wanted it. I couldn&#39;t explain to myself why I had myself, one day, tried to chase her away, why I had then been so afraid of seeing her return! He handed me a glass: - Here, drink this! I threw the entire contents of the glass in his face. He stepped back, wiping his eyes. When he opened his eyelids, I was standing, towering above him; he was so small… — It&#39;s you! - What are you talking about ? - No fuss, you know what I&#39;m talking about! It was you she met the other night… And you told her to give me a sleeping pill… What happened to her? I listen ! He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out an envelope. I snatched it from his hands; it was stuck on and bore no inscription. I tore open the envelope; it contained a sheet folded in four. I recognized the handwriting, a large irregular handwriting, a bit childish: “My darling, I asked him. It is good. I&#39;m sorry I had to lie to you. Please grant me this one favor, listen to him, and above all don&#39;t hurt yourself. You have been wonderful. There was one last word, crossed out but I could decipher: she had signed &quot;Harey.&quot; I read and reread the letter. I had become fully lucid again; I wasn&#39;t going to scream hysterically. Besides, I no longer had a voice, no longer even the strength to moan. I finally whispered: - How ... how? “Later, Kelvin. Calm down ! - I&#39;m calm. Speak ! How ? — By annihilation. - But ... and the device? — Roche&#39;s device was not suitable. Sartorius has built another, a new destabilizer. A miniature device, with a range of a few meters. “And she…” “She disappeared. A flash and a breath of air. A little breath of air. That&#39;s all. — A short-range device… — Yes, we didn&#39;t have the materials to build a large device. The walls tilted towards me, I closed my eyes. “But… she… she will be back. - No. - What do you know about that ? “No, Kelvin, she&#39;s not coming back. Do you remember those wings of foam, going up? Since that day, they haven&#39;t come back. - No ? - No. I say quietly: - You killed her ... - Yes ... in my place, you would have acted differently? I turned my back to him and started to walk across the room. Nine quick steps from the corner to the opposite wall. Return. Nine steps again, ever faster. I stopped in front of Snaut: &#39;Look, we&#39;re going to write a report. We will request immediate liaison with the Council. It&#39;s doable. They will accept. They must accept. The planet will no longer be subject to the rules of the convention of the Four. All means will be allowed. We&#39;ll bring in antimatter generators. Do you believe there is any body that can resist antimatter? There are none! Nothing resists antimatter, nothing, nothing, nothing! – I was screaming and the tears were blinding me. &quot;Do you want to destroy it?&quot; Why ? - Go away, leave me! &quot;No, I&#39;m not going out. &quot;Snaut!&quot; “I was staring at him; he shook his head. - What do you want ? What do you require of me? He backed up to the table. &#39;Fine, we&#39;ll write a report. I started walking again. - Sit down ! he ordered. - Leave me alone ! — There are two separate questions. First, the facts; second, our wishes. &quot;And now is the time to talk about it?&quot; - Yes now. &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear anything. You understood ? Your distinctions don&#39;t interest me. “We sent our last statement about two months ago, before Gibarian died. We should establish exactly the process of appearance ... I grabbed his arm: - You&#39;re going to shut up, yes? - Hit me if you want, I will not be silent. I let go of him: &#39;Oh, talk as much as you please…&#39; &#39;Well, listen!… Sartorius will try to conceal certain facts… I&#39;m almost sure of it. &quot;And you, won&#39;t you hide anything?&quot; - No. Not anymore. The case goes beyond personal responsibilities. You know that as well as I do… “He” showed thoughtful activity. He is able to operate an organic synthesis at the highest level, a synthesis that we ourselves have never achieved. He knows the structure, the microstructure, the metabolism of our body ... - Indeed ... Why do you stop talking? He performed on us a series… a series of experiments. Psychic Vivisection. He used knowledge, which he stole from us, without taking into account our aspirations. &#39;These are no longer facts, Kelvin, nor even propositions. These are assumptions. In a way, he took into account the desires locked away in a secret corner of our mind. He may have sent us…gifts. - Gifts ! Good Lord ! An irrepressible laugh shook me, I howled with laughter. Snaut grabs my hand: - Calm down! I squeezed his fingers; I heard the bones crack. Impassive, his eyelids wrinkled, he braved my gaze. I moved away and took refuge in a corner of the studio. Face turned to the wall, I say: - I&#39;ll try to dominate me. - Yes, of course ... I understand. What do we ask of them? - You decide ... I can not concentrate now ... She said something before? - No nothing. If you want my opinion, now we have a chance. - A chance ? What luck ? A chance to… Ah… – Again, I looked him in the face, and suddenly I understood. - The contact ? Contact again? So you&#39;re not over the head of this madhouse! What more do you need… The Contact? No, no, no, don&#39;t count on me! - Why not ? he said calmly. You, instinctively, and right now more than ever, are treating him like a human being. You hate him. - And you not? “No, Kelvin, no… He&#39;s blind…” I repeated, “Blind? I wasn&#39;t sure I heard correctly. — Or rather, he “sees” differently than we do. We do not exist for him in the same way that we exist for each other. We recognize each other by the appearance of the face, the body… For him, this appearance is a translucent window. It enters directly inside the brain. - Well, so what? What is your point ? If he succeeded in recreating a human being who exists only in my memory, and in such a way that his eyes, his gestures, his voice… his voice… — Go on! Speak ! - I speak ... I speak ... The voice ... the voice ... because he can read us like a book ... Do you understand what I mean? &quot;Yes, that he could get along with us.&quot; - This is not obvious ? - No. It&#39;s not at all obvious. He may have used a crafting recipe expressed in more than words. As a record etched in memory, this recipe takes the form of a protein structure, comparable to a zoosperm or an egg. In the brain, there are no words, no feelings; human memory is a repertoire written in terms of nucleic acids on asynchronous large-molecule crystals. “He” picked up the deepest, most isolated, most “assimilated” imprint, without necessarily knowing what it means for us. Let&#39;s assume that I am able to reproduce the architecture of a symmetry, that I know the materials it is made of, and that I have the technological means to operate efficiently... I create a symmetry and I throw it into the ocean . But I do not know why I do this, I do not know what it is for, I do not know what it means to him ... - Yes, I said, you may be right. In that case, he didn&#39;t mean us any harm, he wasn&#39;t trying to destroy us… Yes, it&#39;s possible. And without any intention… My lips started to quiver. - Kelvin! - Yes, yes, do not worry! You are good, and the ocean is good. Everyone is good. But why?… Explain to me! Why, why did he do this? What did you say to her… to her? - The truth. &quot;The truth, the truth! ... what?&quot; - You know it ... come to my place, we will write the report! Come ! - Hold on ! What exactly do you want? But you don&#39;t intend to stay in the Station? - Yes, I want to stay.
