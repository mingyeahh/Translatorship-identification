I was lying in the dark room. Numb, I stared – for how long? – the luminous dial of the watch strapped to my wrist. I heard my breathing and I felt a vague astonishment. In fact, I was profoundly indifferent to this ring of phosphorescent numbers and even to my astonishment. I attributed it all to fatigue – numbness, amazement and indifference. I turned on my side; the bed seemed strangely wide to me. I held my breath; no sound disturbed the silence. Harey! Why couldn&#39;t I hear him breathe? My arm crossed the surface of the bed; I was alone. I was about to call Harey, when I heard footsteps. A tall, heavy man was approaching… I asked quietly, “Gibarian? - Yes it&#39;s me. Don&#39;t light the lamp! - No ? - It&#39;s not necessary. And it&#39;s better that we stay in the dark. &quot;But are you dead?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that!&quot; You recognized my voice, didn&#39;t you? - Yes. Why did you kill yourself? “I couldn&#39;t do otherwise. You arrived four days late. If you had arrived earlier, I might not have had to kill myself. But don&#39;t worry. I regret nothing. - You&#39;re really there, I do not sleep? &quot;Ah, do you think you dream of me like you thought you dreamed of Harey?&quot; - Where is she ? &quot;Why should I know where she is?&quot; “I have a feeling you know that. “Keep your impressions to yourself. Let&#39;s say I replace her. &quot;I wish she were here too!&quot; - It&#39;s impossible. - Why ? You know very well that in reality it&#39;s not you who are here, that it&#39;s only about me… — No. It&#39;s really me who&#39;s here. It&#39;s me again. But let&#39;s not waste our time in useless chatter! &quot;Are you going back?&quot; - Yes. &quot;And then she will come back?&quot; &quot;Do you want it?&quot; What is it for you? - She&#39;s mine. &#39;You&#39;re afraid of her. - No. - She inspires you with repulsion ... - What do you expect from me? “You have the right to feel sorry for yourself, not his. She will always be twenty years old. You know it very well ! Suddenly, for no specific reason, I calmed down. I listened to him calmly. It seemed to me that he had come even closer and was now standing at the foot of the bed. I did not see him; the darkness remained impenetrable. I whispered: - What do you want? After a moment he replied, “Sartorius convinced Snaut that you had tricked him. Now they are trying to trick you. Under the pretext of setting up an X-ray emitting device, they build a magnetic field annihilator. - Where is she ? &quot;Don&#39;t you hear what I&#39;m telling you?&quot; I came to warn you! - Where is she ? - I do not know. Be careful ! You will need a weapon. You can&#39;t rely on anyone. “I can count on Harey. I heard a muffled noise; he laughed. “Of course, you can count on her, to some extent. And, finally, you can resort to the same expedient as me. “You are not Gibarian. &quot;Ah, really, and who am I?&quot; A dream character? - No. You are just a puppet. But you don&#39;t know that. &quot;And how do you know who you are?&quot; I wanted to get up; I couldn&#39;t move. Gibarian was speaking. I didn&#39;t understand what he was saying; I only heard the sound of his voice. I struggled desperately, trying to overcome the inertia of my body. A jolt and… I woke up. I sucked in the air hungrily. It was dark. I had dreamed, it was a nightmare. And here I heard a distant, monotonous voice: “…a dilemma, which we are unable to resolve. We persecute ourselves. Polythers only use a kind of selective amplifier of our thoughts. As soon as we try to find the motivation for these phenomena, we fall into anthropomorphism. Where there are no men, there can be no motives accessible to man. In order to continue the search, one must destroy either one&#39;s own thoughts or their materialized form. It is not in our power to annihilate our thoughts. As for annihilating their materialized form, that would feel like murder. I immediately recognized Gibarian&#39;s voice. I felt the sheet beside me; I was alone in bed. I had fallen asleep again, I was dreaming again… I called out to him: — Gibarian? The voice broke off in the middle of a word. I heard a low yelp and felt a draft on my face. I yawned: &#39;Well, Gibarian, you pursue me from one dream to another…&#39; I heard a rustle very close to me; I raised my voice: &quot;Gibarian!&quot; The springs of the bed creaked. A voice whispered in my ear, “Kris…it&#39;s me. &quot;Is that you, Harey?&quot; And Gibarian? &quot;Kris...Kris...but he...you told me he was dead!&quot; In a drawling voice, I replied, “He can live in a dream. “However, I wasn&#39;t absolutely certain that I had dreamed. – He spoke to me, he was here… I was terribly sleepy. If I&#39;m sleepy, I tell myself, I might as well sleep. I brushed my lips against Harey&#39;s warm arm and resumed my place in the hollow of the pillow. Harey said something again, but I was already drowsy. In the red morning light, I remembered the events of the night. I had dreamed that I was speaking with Gibarian. But then… I had heard his voice, I would have sworn it under oath. I didn&#39;t quite remember what he said. It was no longer a conversation; it sounded like a speech. A speech?... Harey was dressing. Water was leaking in the bathroom. I looked under the bed, where a few days earlier I had hidden the tape recorder. He was no longer there. &quot;Harey!&quot; – She showed her face dripping with water. – Didn&#39;t you see a tape recorder under the bed, a small pocket tape recorder? — There were several things under the bed. I put everything on it! She pointed to a shelf, next to the pharmacy, and disappeared into the bathroom. I jumped out of bed. My searches were fruitless. When Harey left the bathroom, I said, “Surely you noticed that tape recorder…” She didn&#39;t answer; she was combing her hair in front of the mirror. Only then did I realize that she was pale and her gaze, when I met it in the mirror, expressed suspicious curiosity. Stubbornly, I continued, “Harey, the tape recorder isn&#39;t on that shelf! - You have nothing more important to tell me? I mumbled, &quot;I beg your pardon.&quot; You&#39;re right, I&#39;m stupid for making such a fuss over a tape recorder. No, absolutely no argument! We went to have our breakfast. Harey was not behaving like other days; but it was impossible for me to define the difference. She looked around her; several times, lost in thought, she did not hear what I was saying to her. And one time when she looked up, I saw her eyes were wet. I whispered: &quot;What&#39;s the matter, are you crying?&quot; She stammered: - Oh, leave me alone! These are not real tears. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have settled for that answer, but I dreaded nothing more than &quot;sincere conversations.&quot; I was also preoccupied with other problems; I had dreamed that Snaut and Sartorius were plotting against me and, certain that I had only dreamed, I nevertheless wondered if I would find some defensive weapon in the Station. I worried only about having a weapon, without trying to imagine what I would do with it. I tell Harey I should inspect the stockrooms and warehouse stores. Quietly, she followed me. I rummaged through the crates, poked around in the capsules, and when I got to the bottom, I couldn&#39;t help but peek into the central refrigeration unit. I wouldn&#39;t let Harey in; I opened the door a crack and looked around the room. The dark shroud covered an elongated form; from the doorway, I was unable to see if the black woman was still sleeping next to Gibarian&#39;s corpse. It seemed to me that she was no longer there. I couldn&#39;t find anything that suited me. I wandered from one store to another and my mood grew more and more sullen. Suddenly, I noticed that Harey had disappeared. She reappeared immediately – she had lingered in the hallway. While it was so painful for her to lose sight of me, even for a moment, she had tried to get away from me! That should have surprised me. Yet I continued to display an offended attitude – but who had offended me? – and to behave, in truth, like a moron. I suffered from a severe headache. Enraged, I emptied the entire contents of the pharmacy onto the floor – no trace of antineuralgic pills! I didn&#39;t want to go back to the operating room. I didn&#39;t want anything. Never had I been in a worse mood. Harey glided like a shadow across the room; from time to time she would withdraw somewhere – I don&#39;t know where, I paid her no attention – then she would come back. In the afternoon, in the kitchen (we had just had lunch, but Harey had, in fact, swallowed nothing at all; afflicted with my headache, without appetite myself, I had not attempted to &#39;encourage to eat), Harey left his place and came to sit beside me; she pinched the sleeve of my blouse. I growled: - What is it? I intended to go up, for the pipes echoed with crackling echoes – Sartorius, it seemed, was fiddling with a high-voltage device. But I should have taken Harey with me. Already difficult to justify in the library, his presence risked provoking elsewhere, near the machines, some unfortunate remark on the part of Snaut. I gave up going out. &quot;Kris,&quot; she whispered, &quot;how are we both doing?&quot; I sighed in spite of myself; decidedly, I was not in luck that day. - Everything is fine. Why ? - I would like to talk to you. - Well, I&#39;m listening. - Not like this. - How ? I have a headache, you know, I have a lot of worries... - A little good will, Kris! I forced myself to smile; it was surely a miserable smile. - Speak, my darling, please. &quot;Will you tell me the truth?&quot; I frowned; I didn&#39;t like this preamble. “Why would I lie? &quot;Perhaps you have your reasons, serious reasons.&quot; But if you want… listen, don&#39;t tell me lies! - I shut up. “I&#39;m going to tell you something, and then you&#39;ll tell me something too. Good ? But promise me to answer me the truth, without detours! – I avoided his gaze, which sought my eyes. “I already told you, I don&#39;t know how I got here. You may know that. Hold on ! You may not know that. But if you know, and you can&#39;t tell me now, will you tell me sometime later? I wouldn&#39;t be any the worse for it, and in any case you would give me a chance. An icy blood ran through my veins; I stammered: — What are you talking about, my child… what luck? “Kris, whoever I am, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not a child. You promised to answer. “Whoever I am! My throat was tight and I looked at Harey, shaking my head stupidly, as if I was trying not to hear any more. &quot;I&#39;m not asking you for an explanation. Just tell me you&#39;re not allowed to talk. I replied in a hoarse voice: - I&#39;m not hiding anything from you ... She stood up: - Very well. I wanted to say something. We couldn&#39;t stop there. But the words did not pass. “Harey…” Standing in front of the window, her back was to me. The blue-black ocean stretched out under a bare sky. “Harey, if you think… Harey, you know I love you…” “Me? I approached; I wanted to take her in my arms. She pulled away and pushed my hand away. &quot;You&#39;re too good,&quot; she said. You love Me ? I&#39;d rather you beat me! “Harey, honey! - No, no, shut up! She came back to the table and gathered the plates. I gazed at the ocean. The sun was setting; the Station&#39;s shadow lengthened and undulated with the waves. Harey dropped a plate, which fell to the floor. Water was running in the sink. A dull golden arch circled the russet firmament. If only I knew what to do! Oh, if only I knew… Suddenly there was silence. Harey stood behind me. &quot;No, don&#39;t turn around,&quot; she said quietly. You&#39;re not guilty of anything, Kris. I know it. Don&#39;t worry. I reached out to grab her. She fled to the back of the kitchen and lifted a pile of plates: — Too bad they&#39;re unbreakable, I would gladly break them, I would break them all! For a moment I thought she was really going to throw the plates on the floor; but she looked at me and smiled: — Don&#39;t be afraid, I won&#39;t make a scene. Mind alert, I woke up in the middle of the night; I sat up in bed. The room was dark; through the half-open door, a faint light came from the rotunda. I heard an ominous hiss, accompanied by heavy, muffled blows, as if some massive body were furiously hitting a wall. A meteor had struck the shell of the Station! No, not a meteor, a rocket, since I heard a horrible rattle, trailing ... I shook myself. There were no more rockets than meteors. Someone was moaning down the hall! I ran in the direction the noise was coming from. I saw a luminous rectangle; the door of the small workshop was open. I rushed inside. An icy vapor enveloped me. My breath fell to snow. White snowflakes swirled above a bathrobe, and under the robe there was a body heaving weakly and hitting the floor. The cloud of frost prevented me from seeing anything distinctly. I threw myself on Harey, seized her round the body; the bathrobe burned my skin. Harey continued to groan. I ran down the hall; I passed several doors; I no longer felt the cold. I only felt a breath, which burned my neck like a flame. I laid Harey on the operating table and pushed the robe aside. Harey! A miserable face, quivering. The lips were covered with a thick, black coating of frozen blood; the tongue sparkled, bristling with ice crystals. Liquid oxygen… The Deware cylinders piled up in the workshop contained liquid oxygen. Shards of glass had cracked under my feet as I approached Harey. How much oxygen had she drunk? No matter ! The windpipe, the throat, the lungs, everything was burnt; liquid oxygen gnaws the flesh more surely than concentrated acids. The breathing was fading – a creak, a snap of tearing paper. Her eyes were closed. It was agony. I examined the large glass cabinets filled with instruments and medicines. A tracheotomy? An intubation? She has no more lungs! Medication ? So many drugs! Rows of colored bottles and boxes lined the shelves. She was still moaning; a trickle of mist escaped from between his open lips. The thermophores… I started looking for them, then I changed my mind. I ran to another cabinet, I upset boxes of light bulbs. And now, a syringe – where are the syringes? Here&#39;s one that needs to be sterilized. I struggled in vain with the lid of the sterilizer; my numb, insensitive fingers refused to bend. The rattle grew louder. I jumped up to Harey. She had opened her eyes. &quot;Harey!&quot; It hadn&#39;t even been a whisper; I was speechless. My face no longer belonged to me, the lips did not obey me; I wore a plaster mask. I looked at Harey. The ribs quivered under the white skin; the snow had melted and damp hair had spread across the headrest. And Harey was looking at me. &quot;Harey!&quot; I was unable to say more. I stood there stiff as a log; my hands were hanging down, foreign to my body. I felt a burning sensation, which rose from my feet, climbed, attacked my lips, my eyelids. A drop of blood melted and ran down his cheek, drawing an oblique line. The tongue twitched and disappeared. Harey continued to groan. I grab his wrist; I felt no pulse. I stuck my ear under the left breast, against the frozen body. I heard the din of a raging storm and, in the distance, a gallop, the beating of the heart, so accelerated that I could not count them. I remained thus bent over, my eyelids lowered; something touched my head. Harey had run his fingers through my hair. I sat up. She moaned, “Kris! I took her hand; she answered my gesture with a pressure that crushed my bones. Then she grimaced horribly and lost consciousness again. I could only see the whites of his eyes; a shrill growl ripped through his throat and convulsions shook his whole body. I had trouble keeping her on the operating table; she escaped me and her head hit the edge of a porcelain basin. I caught up with her: I tried to control her, but every moment a violent spasm lifted her and she tore herself from my embrace. I was dripping with sweat; my legs were wobbly. When the convulsions subsided, I tried to put her to bed. She thrust her chest forward and sucked in the air. Suddenly, eyes, Harey&#39;s eyes, lit up that horrible bloody face. &quot;Kris…since when…since when, Kris?&quot; She choked; a pink foam rose to his lips. Convulsions seized her again. With the rest of my strength, I clung to his shoulders. She fell on her back; his teeth chattered. She was panting. - No, no, no, she sighed hastily, and I thought the end was approaching. But the convulsions started again. And again I held her in my arms; from time to time she sucked in the air painfully and all her ribs stuck out. Then the eyelids half closed over the blind eyes. She stiffened. This time it was the end. I didn&#39;t even try to wipe the foam from his lips. I heard a distant ringing. I watched for the last breath – then my strength would completely fail me and I would crumble to the ground. She continued to breathe; the rattle was no more than a light hiss. The chest, which no tremor no longer agitated, began to come alive again to the rapid rhythm of the beating of the heart. Cheeks flushed. With my back arched, I gazed at her; I didn&#39;t understand yet. My palms were sweaty; a soft and supple material covered my ears; yet I heard this ringing which persisted. Harey lifted his lids and our eyes met. I wanted to pronounce his name; no sound crossed my lips. My face remained dead; I still wore this heavy mask. I could only watch her. She moved her head, surveying the room. Somewhere behind me, in another world, water was dripping from a poorly closed tap. Harey leaned on one elbow; she sat down. I stepped back. She was watching me. &#39;What,&#39; she said, &#39;what is it? It didn&#39;t work? Why…why are you looking at me like that? – And, suddenly, an atrocious cry: Why are you looking at me like that? The silence. She looked at her hands, wiggled her fingers. - It&#39;s me ? she asked. With lip service, in one breath, I said, “Harey…” She repeated, “Harey? Slowly, she slid over the edge of the operating table. She staggered, regained her balance, and took a few steps. She was acting in a stupor; she looked at me without seeming to see me. &quot;Hary?&quot; she repeated again. But… I&#39;m not Harey. Who am I ? Hary? And you, you? His eyes widened, sparkled, and a surprised smile lit up his face. &quot;And you, Kris?&quot; Maybe you too… I was silent; I had backed up to the wall; I was leaning against a closet door. The smile faded. &#39;No,&#39; she said. No, you are afraid. But I can&#39;t stand this situation. It&#39;s impossible. I knew nothing about it. Even now, I don&#39;t understand anything. No it&#39;s impossible ! I…” She clenched her white fists and slapped her chest. &quot;I didn&#39;t know anything except… except that I was Harey!&quot; Do you think I&#39;m acting? I&#39;m not acting, I swear, I&#39;m not acting! She moaned the last words and collapsed on the floor sobbing. Something gave way inside me. With one bound, I was near her and I surrounded her with my arms. She struggled, pushed me away, sobbing without tears, and she cried: &quot;Leave me, leave me!&quot; I disgust you, I know it! I don&#39;t want, I don&#39;t want! You can see it&#39;s not me, not me, not me... I shook her and yelled: &#39;Shut up! Kneeling in front of each other, we were both screaming. Harey&#39;s head fell on my shoulder. I hugged her to me with all my might. Panting, we did not move. Water dripped from the faucet. She stammered, her face in the crook of my shoulder, “Kris… tell me what I have to do to disappear! Kris… I yelled, “Shut up! She raised her head and looked at me: - What, you either, you do not know? We can&#39;t do anything, nothing? “Harey… please! - I tried ... No, no, leave me, I do not want you to touch me! I disgust you. - It&#39;s not true! &quot;You&#39;re lying...I disgust you...and I disgust myself too...oh, if only I could, if only I could.&quot; &quot;Would you kill yourself?&quot; - Yes. &quot;And I don&#39;t want to!&quot; You understood ? I don&#39;t want you to die. I want you here, with me, I don&#39;t want anything else! The big gray eyes stared at me. &quot;You&#39;re lying,&quot; she said softly. I released her and got up; she remained seated on the floor. &quot;Tell me what I have to do to make you believe me!&quot; I swear to you that I am not lying. Only you exist, only you count for me. &quot;There&#39;s no way you&#39;re telling the truth, since I&#39;m not Harey.&quot; &quot;So who are you?&quot; She was silent for a long moment. Several times his chin quivered. Finally, she lowered her head and whispered, “Harey…but…I know that&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not me... that you once loved. — Indeed, but the past no longer exists, the past is dead. Here, today, it is you that I love. You understand ? She shook her head. &quot;You&#39;re good.&quot; Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t appreciate everything you&#39;ve done. You acted for the best, you did everything you could. But there is nothing to do. The first morning, when I was waiting beside your bed for you to wake up, I knew nothing. Only three days have passed, but it seems like a long, long time ago. I was behaving like crazy. My head was full of fog. I didn&#39;t remember anything, I wasn&#39;t surprised at anything – I felt like you feel after a narcosis, or after a long illness. I even thought that maybe I had been sick, and that you didn&#39;t want to tell me. Then certain events gave me food for thought. You know what I&#39;m referring to. Then you had this conversation in the library, with this man – what&#39;s his name? – Snaut, yes. You refused to explain anything to me, so I got up at night and listened to the tape on the tape recorder. I only lied that one and only time, Kris – when you were looking for the tape recorder, I knew where it was, I hid it. The man who recorded this tape – what&#39;s his name? — Gibarian. “Yes, Gibarian. Listening to it, I understood everything. Although in truth I continue to understand nothing. I just didn&#39;t know that I can&#39;t… that I&#39;m not… that there&#39;s no end. He didn&#39;t say anything about it. He may have said it, but you woke up, and I turned off the tape recorder. I had heard enough to learn that I am not a human being, but an instrument. - What are you talking about ? - Yes. To study your reactions, or something like that. Each one of you has a--an instrument like me. We come out of your memories, or your imagination, I&#39;m not sure. Besides, you know all that better than me. He tells such terrible, implausible things… If it didn&#39;t tally with the rest, I surely wouldn&#39;t have believed him! - The rest ? “Oh, the fact that I don&#39;t need to sleep, and that I have to follow you everywhere. Yesterday I thought you hated me and that made me unhappy. What an idiot! But how could I have imagined the truth? He, Gibarian, he didn&#39;t hate this woman at all, who was with him, but he talks about it in such a way... so appalling! Only then did I understand that nothing depended on me, that I could do this or that, it doesn&#39;t matter, it would always be torture for you. Worse than torture, because the instruments of torture are passive and innocent, as innocent as the stone that falls and kills you. That an instrument of torture loves you and wishes you well was beyond my comprehension. I would have liked to tell you all that, to communicate to you the little that I had understood. I thought this might be useful to you. I even tried to take notes ... I cleared my throat and asked painfully: - Is that why you had lit a lamp? - Yes. But I couldn&#39;t write anything. I was looking within myself for this… you know, this “influence”… I was panicked. It seemed to me that I had no body under my skin, that in me there was something… different, that I was only an appearance, destined to deceive you. You understand ? - I understand. - When we do not sleep at night, and we think for hours, we go very far in thought, you know, and we engage on strange paths ... - Yes, I know. “But I felt my heart beating. And I remembered that you tested my blood. How is it, my blood, tell me, tell me the truth! Now you can tell me the truth. “Your blood is like mine. - Truly ? - I swear to you. - What does it mean ? I was thinking that maybe this... this unknown thing was hiding somewhere inside me, maybe taking up very little space. But I didn&#39;t know where it was hiding. Now I think I was trying to come up with a subterfuge, because I couldn&#39;t make up my mind; I was scared, I was looking for another way out. But, Kris, if I have the same blood as you… if really… No, it&#39;s impossible. I would be dead already, wouldn&#39;t I? This means that there is still a difference. Where is the difference ? In the head ? But I guess I think like any other human being...and I don&#39;t know! If this unknown thing was thinking in my head, I would know everything. And I wouldn&#39;t love you. I&#39;d be acting, knowing I&#39;m acting… Kris, please tell me everything you know. Maybe we will find a solution? - Which solution ? – She was silent. – Would you like to die? - Yes I think. Again silence. Harey sat hunched over. I surveyed the room, the furniture painted in white enamel, the sparkling instruments; my gaze desperately tried to catch hold of some hitherto unsuspected beacon which would suddenly have revealed itself. &quot;Harey, can I say something too?&quot; – She waited silently. - It&#39;s true, you&#39;re not exactly like me. But this finding is not pejorative. On the contrary. Whatever your opinion on this subject, it is thanks to this… difference, that you are not dead. She gave a painful little smile, the smile of a sad child: &#39;Does that mean I&#39;m…immortal?&#39; - I do not know. In any case, you are much less vulnerable than me. She whispered: - It&#39;s awful ... - Maybe less awful than you think. &#39;But you don&#39;t envy me. “Harey, I don&#39;t know what… fate awaits you. Truth be told, your fate is as unpredictable as mine, as unpredictable as the fate of any of the Station&#39;s inhabitants. The experiment will continue, and anything can happen ... - Or nothing. - Or nothing. And I confess to you that I prefer that nothing happens. Not because I&#39;m afraid (although fear no doubt plays its part in this affair), but because there will be no outcome. Of that I am absolutely certain. &quot;What outcome?&quot; Are you talking about this… ocean? She shivered. — Yes, contact with the ocean. I think the problem is actually very simple. A contact means the exchange of certain knowledge, of certain notions, or at least of certain results, of certain facts – but if there is no possible exchange? If the elephant is not a giant microbe, the ocean is not a giant brain. On both sides, of course, attempts can be made. And the consequence of one of these attempts is that you are here, now, with me. And I try to explain to you that I love you. Your very presence erases the twelve years of my life that I have devoted to the study of Solaris, and I want to keep you with me. Were you sent to me to torture me, or to soften my existence, or are you only an instrument ignorant of its function and which is used to examine me as through a microscope? Are you being used to show me friendship, to deal me an insidious blow, or to make fun of me? Perhaps all of this at the same time, or perhaps – and this is most likely – it is something quite different. But why worry about the intentions of our parents – even if our procreators look nothing alike? You will answer that our future depends on these intentions, and I will not contradict you. No more than you do I foresee the future. I can&#39;t even assure you that I will always love you. Given what happened, anything is to be expected. Maybe tomorrow I will be transformed into a green jellyfish? Nothing depends on us. But since it&#39;s up to us to make a decision today, let&#39;s decide to stay together! What do you say ? &quot;Listen, I would like to ask you again… Do I… do I look a lot like her?&quot; “You looked a lot like him. Now I don&#39;t know anymore. - I do not understand ... She had risen and looked at me with her huge eyes. - It&#39;s just you. - And you&#39;re sure it&#39;s not her, it&#39;s only me, me that ... - Yes, you. If you were really her, maybe I couldn&#39;t love you… — Why? “Because I did something horrible. “Were you…mean to her?” - Yes, when we ... - Do not say anything! - Why ? &quot;So you don&#39;t forget that it&#39;s me who&#39;s here, not her.&quot;
